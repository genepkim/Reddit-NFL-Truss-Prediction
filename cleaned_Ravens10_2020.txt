joe flacco gets too much hate even though he has a winner mentality and is cracked on the football may lamar bless his soul and we shall receive the fated jets v ravens superbowl
this is the one that lived flacco is good
he throws such a nice spiral
jets v ravens superbowl

hey man can you guys do us a solid and beat the steelers
probably going to play you in the wc unless you beat the steelers
as far as a normal team would go pretty well

but as far as our expectations for the season id say pretty meh

the defense is incredible but our offense seems to be missing a spark a lot the time its like we had such a great pace and rhythm last year and this year its like sometimes we try to force too much and arent finding a rhythm until later in the game personally i think a lot of that is because of how much better our whole line was with yanda last year still a lot of season left to get really rolling though
i am both optimistic and pessimistic about this season the bills are my backup team tho because of diggs so blessd be thy season
would be great if you guys throw the assist in a few weeks
bro i fucking love josh allen and diggs if we cant win it all i hope you guys do
honestly im mad jealous of your wrs
i love buffalo the city i was out there for the game last season fans were great i had a great time

3 things real quick

1 reddit chat is an unholy mess of a feature however as it seems our last brave volunteer to mod the chat has realized how thankless the job is and right now that opening is completely vacant and will accept almost any volunteers feel free to apply here if you are feeling masochistic

2 id actually rather discourage the use of a halfbaked feature from reddit in fact if what your craving is chat style way of engaging with other fans id recommend discord in fact ill even plug this bad boy its likely the largest active one at the moment and id bet its more well run than this sub

3 now im a little hesitant to say that this our official discord however because i dont want to discourage anyone else from creating any other fan specific discords maybe youve always wanted nonknee jerk reactions and deep draft analysis or somewhere to stick your unpopular opinions where you wont get downvoted to oblivion but anyway feel free to create discuss and advertise any discords you want in this thread if you peak at the big one and dont like what you see unlikely imho
hello rravens subreddit

i am the creator of the discord linked as an alternative chat the mod team and i have been doing what we can to grow out our community to make it even more rocking during games and even just a place to chill with people you know you have something in common

on the discord we have killer emotes that you cant have on reddit we have a person who has been creating wallpapers for your pc or phone from requests discord also allows for fairly seamless embedding of pictures straight into the chat in live time you wont have to click a link to see that meme someone else posted

x200b

we have some verified members of the ravens marching band that chill out with us and are in the works of trying to get an ama with them going

we are currently shooting for partner status on discord and could use more people who are actively talking in order to hit that mark we are trying to organize some game night stuff like jack box party games as well as among us nights
ive got a lot of time on my hands how much time needs to be put into moderating the chat if its just as simple as removing any mean or unproductive posts then id be ok with modding the chatroom
the discord is great its perfect for gameday especially with a load of people in there during the games but lots of chatter in between the games during the week too

love this teams culture
bro bro bro bro bro bro

lmao glad i earned my rent free place in your head
can someone remove this post can we get a mod this isnt ravens related

we have enough trolling as it is we dont need to troll other people its the internet we have enough of that everywhere else
slayerdown is a little cuck


lol perriman just dropped a perfect td passahhh the memories
come on flacco
do what the cowboys almost did
this was a strange week in nfl
lets see that spark back after yesterday it can happen
i will always have nothing but love in my heart for that man and what he did for us
no matter how average he was his super bowl run was the stuff of legends

just watching the anthem it panned over to flacco and it looked like he was a little teary eyed although maybe ik wrong

hoping he has a good game just like in fitzmagics caseyou never know when your final snap might be as a starter hopefully he does well tonight
flacco perriman
aaaand perriman drops a td pass old habits
1833 195 1 td
that takes me back
he had an elite first half
it is still weird to see him in a green helmet
that elite perriman flacco combination
a td to other former washedup raven breshad perriman

new york exraven in full effect
i guess im the bad guy by pointing out that the int was a bad mistake and taking the sack on the last possession led to the winning fg



lol man i dont remember xenophobia being this funny
removed
was a nice drive from flacco he does throw a pretty ball
i feel like im watching the 2017 season first down run second down run third down pass dropped lol
god he sucks attack the ball bro youre in the nfl you should know how to catch a ball and its not like a punt
i remember him doing that exact same thing against cincy at some point
crazy how he cant catch because perriman is big

joe cant escape perrimans mediocrity
now do one where perriman catches a 50yd td pass from flacco
poor joe cant get away from that bum
come on man that was perfect throw from an elite qb and you drop that pass smh
dont worry just connected for 50 lol
sorry for hitting you in the hands
perrimans about to get hot
you had you chances
imagine my shock
that was a dime from joe too vintage pass right there
its still weird seeing the 2 of them flacco dropped a dime and perriman did what he does flacco looked good on that drive
ptsd
off a perfect pass from flacco too lmao he was showing him how to catch it after the fg too on the sideline
right that would have been awesome to start
perfect pass by flacco to the end zone and he drops it all is right in the world once more
i blame ozzie for drafting perriman way too high
breshard perriman still dropping passes from flacco smh

right after that pretty good first down catch as well
he just made up for it lmao
he looks sharp so far
biggest draft bust
nothing has changed then

yea their were some better receivers that year for sure but he is still a good one and could start for any team in the league and as u mentioned it could be a lot worse
he still can be hill to our mahomes but we cant use him
aj brown was in that class too low key a very productive class
i still think he can be a good even great receiver if we had last years ol and more confidence to throw deep routes especially touch passes i think hed be a deadly receiver theres several factors working against him right now unfortunately
i was one of the guys that wanted nkeal bad because of his hands and blocking ability

thank god im not the gm
not gonna liei really wanted harry in that draft good thing decosta didnt want him
i think when we compare hollywood to other receivers in his class and who we shouldve drafted we should always consider that lamar wanted hollywood and the team got him
brown is too small to be a wr1 would be the top slot receiver in the league
i mean its the nature of the draft there were great receivers in that class harry aj brown hollywood deebo samuel mecole hardman not only that but these guys all went ahead of metcalf he was the last pick of the 2nd round everyone passed on him at least twice including the seahawks

all that to say everybody comparing hollywood to dk is retarded


flaccoface is the new pokerface
and honestly many young qbs can learn a lot from it
having to lineup at wideout as a decoy with lamar in the backfield
i low key kinda really miss flacco nothing to do with his ability or lamars abilities just always liked flacco himself
denny s dennis is out of chocolate milk but he has plenty of cinnamon buns lets all primp our hair watch the bachelorette together

touchdown to perriman
and the jets take the lead
im happy for flacco watched him grow up here in baltimore so ill always root for him
finally
great touch on the ball still always amazed when perriman holds on
there goes flaccooooo i love him
elite
joe still has that cannon
big dick joe big dick joe

if only this connection was there 3 years ago
goddamnit ill turn it on then shit
i hit my weed pen before watching this tell me this is 2020
i love how were celebrating this you guys are my people i love it
i saw that and said fucking bruh

my elite dragon
awesome i love to see it
ill always have his back for that legendary sb run
our boys are fighting out there hopefully flacco beats the pats like the old days
both td passes were dimes flacco and perriman finally molding together like we hoped all these years
joe flacco has 3 td passes in a game against the patriots for the 4th time in his career including playoffs jamisonhensley

most games with 3 td passes vs pats since 2000

peyton manning 6

joe flacco 4

russell wilson 3
and he caught it
where was this like ever
take it back now yall two times this time
2nd time tonight
joe flaccobreshad perriman connection jamisonhensley

he has 1100 yardsin 3 seasons since he left the ravens he still stinks
he already had a big drop
there was a lot of bad to mediocre receivers at the top of that draft dorian green beckham devin funchess devin smith philip dorset perriman agholor and kevin white were all taken top 50 the exceptions were amari cooper and devante parker who just turned it around in his 5th year

flacco will always be a raven at least to me im happy to see him succeed
removed
e
nice throw and catch vintage flacco cant help but cheer for the jets this game makes it easier when its against the pats
the baltimore jets lol great to see flacco slinging it out there

now if only the jets could trade us mekhi becton i do believe we have a 5th rounder to throw up

that pass to perriman for the 50yd tid was vintage joe
joe flacco is elite baby lets go hes going to beat the pats one last time
i love getting to root for joe again like this joe tossing dimes tonight
and he just dropped a dime to crowder this game is brining a tear to my eye
he just hit them with another flacco special
the road for him to get from 96 to 100 career wins has been brutal
joe will always be my elite quarterback after living through the years of wright and boller having a competent quarterback was an unknown feeling i feel like if you didnt live through those terrible terrible years you wont be able to appreciate joe especially with all these quarterbacks throwing for 5k yards a year
im hoping he beats the patriots one more time for nostalgia i love seeing joe and perriman playing well
look at perrimans hands i dont even recognize him awesome
ragedlikemilk
holy shit that td to crowder
i didnt realize how much i missed watching the elite dragon shit all over the patriots i am thoroughly enjoying this
this has been the game of the week for me miss the best qb in ravens historyso far



that td pass to crowder is easily one of the best thrown tds of the week had an absolute small window to get that in there and he made it look easy great play by the wr there as well to get both feet in bounds and of course its not vintage joe without a huge opi there as well getting to see it all
on this glorious monday november 11th 2020 night joe flacco has reverted back to his 201213 playoff form even if its for one game only the elite dragon has risen also breshad perriman is in the process of having at least the second best game in his career because why not

update well flacco just threw an interception i guess the return of the elite dragon was fun while it lasted he was at his super bowlwinning playoff form for three quarters only to become what he was like during his last few years in baltimore when it mattered most in the 4th quarter still it was nice to see flacco perform like his old self perhaps one last time in primetime
i cant believe the patriots are this bad its mind blowing
this is the joe i know always shows up against the pats baby

eeeeeeeliiiiiiiiiiite
poor patriots having to play joe flacco and the ravens in back to back games and by poor patriots i mean hahahahaa
this is on me guys as soon as i started talking shit to my patriot fan friends he immediately thew that pick
go joe cool
good for flacco man wouldve really appreciated this connection with him and perriman in 2017 but im happy for him
elitedragonflacco montana
until he didntagain
flacco is slinging it tonight
elite
so fn elite
you should have waited till after the game

totally jinxed it and caused that interceptionhope he still pulls it out tho
damn jets took an l what a good game though
just got intercepted
and they blow it for him by touching the guy on the ground with 3 seconds left instead of letting the clock run out lol
anddddd its gone
well the carrying the jets past the patriots thing didnt age as well as any of us would have liked lol
one of the best deep ball throwers of all time in all honesty
ill never understand the hate the fanbase has for joe
i am so pumped get em joe
fucking legend dude flacco still elite
so elite
the dragon
twelve men on the line giving away a first down inside your 10 come on jets youre killing joes night

does seeing all those hook ups between joe and perriman make anyone a little jealous that this never panned out for us
im not gonna lie im kinda gutted they lost

pretty nice to hear his 180 he somehow manages to put the letter r in that a few times
well i kinda need the jets not to start winning games for reasons
he still loves to take the sack on big plays cant say ii miss that he still has a cannon though
vintage flacco is my entire teenage years i love this man so much
as a browns fan its great to see him out there winning even better that its not against us for the 300th time guy has got a cannon
bill is purposely losing out so he gets trevor first overall calling it now
this whole thread needs to be nuked
goat 20th
ravens fans hardon for this guy is weird as hell i live near green bay and would never see this gaga crap for favre after he left course you guys dont have rodgers for your next franchise qb

is this like pining over your ex after you see them at the mall with someone else
so you mean to tell me flacco and perriman couldnt do this in baltimore kinda pisses me off seeing this

that bomb to crowder
he just dropped a fucking dime
dimes
can the elite dragon fuck up the pats one last time
god damn flacco is a cooking rn
that was our quarterback
fucking beautiful throw
goat
e l i t e
this is wild
thats my super bowl mvp
fuck man that was absolutely gorgeous
flacco v pats in primetime clutch
jets passing game looks better than ours

hoping we can really light up this pats defence when we play them

edit if we can get a passing game complimented with a run like the second half to the colts game i think we can really score nicely on this team i feel confident our defence can keep this team in check
this patriots ol is going to get cam fucking murdered next week
i love it

removed
i hope he bears new england that would be hilarious fuck the patriots
that 40 yard dpi penalty was vintage joe flacco was beautiful to see brought a tear to my eye
his deep throw to perriman was beautiful happy to see him but seeing perrimanoh what couldve been
im on here shitting on him nonstop but that last td was a thing of beauty
you think hell come back and help lamar find his arm again


its nice to see flacco lighting it up w his deep bombs again
flacco to perriman
flacco will always be my quarterback
yeah its nice but the pats will get trevor lawrence at this rate i dont want the pats to succeed ever again
we spoke too soon
game hasnt been over for 5 minutes and this already didnt age well
not gonna lie with lamars recent struggles i started to miss him
dont you love it when all he needs to win is a first down and he has a dude wide open just past the yellow line but he holds it to try and bomb it down the field and then gets sacked and that gives the other team the ball back dont you love that
i love joe but he always needed a defense


cant believe he beat suggs
got his hair game sorted out about 5 years ago and never looked back
but he mustnt forget where he came from ill never forget when he looked like burt from sesame street

what did the steelers do to ours
removed
flacco balling
this cant be real life lol
pats getting flacced
this shit is insane and im loving it lmao
another one
this is evidence we live in the matrix
dropping some beauties he looks very comfortable
iron dick joe lives to fuck up the patriots
flacco is killing it best game of his since 2018 wk 1 i think this game will keep him in the league as a backup a few more good performances will result in a team considering him as a bridge qb

on another note i watched several bucs games last yr bc i wanted to see the jameis rollercoaster in action perriman was good last yr he was uncoverable at times
if mosley was playing this would have been 2017 all over again
these commentators really went the pats to win they talk like theyre already going to comeback and win
removed
elite dragon
patriot slayer
hot take and not 100 convinced im right we give up on pass catchers too soon

at least joe flaccos model here got a decent upgrade since the last time espn used this animation
such a monstrous playoff run he had absolute elite teams he beat on the way to our 2nd ring
only meaningful stretch of his career where he was above average

besides this hes never had 4 consecutive games of 100 passer rating or 4 consecutive games without a pick

loving all the joe love in here tonight
is elite
joe flacco
joe joe flacco flacco
joe flacco
throws a pick

seeing flacco triggers their ptsd

god i miss joe but sure as hell dont miss stone hands perriman

removed
you jinxed it
agreed
removed
i hate to be the bearer of bad news but he just threw a pick
i saw some posts here about the flacco to perriman connection i thought to myself yeah lets get in on that be nice to watch flacco do well again first offensive play i see flacco throws into double coverage and gets intercepted sigh

dont get me wrong i have really fond memories of flacco between 08 and 14 but damn he somehow found a way to disappoint me one last time lol

edit i cant spell as demonstrated by the title
hes going to pull the w here its coming
we couldnt expect him to be completely accurate after all this time
the losing streak for the jets end tonight


might be a bad take but im sticking with it lol
same got on the couch and the first play i saw was the interception

is the game still on
man he sucks if we dont win by more than 14 next week i will be disappointed guy has no accuracy at all
honestly a shame hes declined this much his 2015 season was pretty legendary hes definitely still feeling the effects of some shoulder injury though because even though hes never been the most accurate qb its especially bad now its easy to look competent vs the jets defense but its not gonna be easy for them vs us especially with hump back
peters will eat these deep balls to no one
well be as good as the pressure we can bring
i honestly think hes still fine enough but that patriots offense has 0 talent around him brady looked even worse last year and he has been at least competent with a reasonable supporting cast in tampa so we should still be blowing them out especially if marlon is back
is marlon back against them
seems like it should be easy enough just clog the middle with bigs hes too slow to get the edge stay in his face and hell chuck it to no one plenty of times
he seems really reluctant to step into his throws dude needs to just sling it i know he can

better wait another week though

in 3 seasons 29 games not in baltimore perriman has already caught 10 tds

in 2 seasons 27 games in baltimore he caught 3 tds all in his first season
i think it proves that he was nowhere near his first round pick level but had the potential to become good its unfortunate that our ability to develop wrs seems to be the worst in the league

i predict another deep pass and a w for the jets lol
still throwing pics and taking sacks at the worst possible times im rooting for ya bud but its bring back all kinds of pain
2012 joe for 3 quarters 2018 joe for the most important
oh well it was still good to see that spark from joe he definitely had his moments tonight
quite an extensive celebration for the pats after barely beating a winless team really enjoying watching them struggle this season
high key sad flacco couldnt best the pats but low key happy the pats won because i wouldnt want to play the pats after they got embarrassed in prime time against the worst team in football it wouldve felt like a definite trap game if second half ravens from yest come out we should stomp ne next week but if first half ravens come out itll be a looooong night
i feel terrible for joe played a hell of a game
omg the jets fuckin suck
even so i still feel if joe played like this while with the ravens he doesnt lose this game

we were fortunate to have some of the best defensive players in the history of the nfl to keep us from losing a game like this

at least it was fun to watch joe looked like he was having fun out there the jets are just an overall dumpster fire
still taking the blame for shit defense to it seems
im pretty sure gase or douglas had to tell him they were tanking
anyone notice how if a play doesnt immediately go joes way hell just give up no improvising whatsoever
time for newton to throw a int
i cant wait til sunday night
on one hand im bummed cuz i hate seeing joe lose

on another im happy as nothing would make me happier then seeing the jets to winless
from elite to defeat in a single drive

lamar will stunt on those practice squad hoes

ok
youre so fucking toxic holy shit
well i taught the second cousin of the ravens water boys step father who married the monday night football camera guys sister wtf is this nonsense you attempted to teach lmao
lamar didnt lose one lamar played this week without three

removed
what are you talking about

you probably jinxed it it should be coming soon hes slowly breaking down a different injury on the injury report every week love jimmy though
fucking delete this you dolt
removed

while youre here come see us on the ravens discord
i miss him so much

great work btw


lol professional debaters

a few years ago ben wore a walking boot on his noninjured leg so the injured one wouldnt be targeted in the game tomlin is a sneaky sob
fat ben is a tough fucker i hate him but the dude does not go down easily
thats peak shittsburgh right there
nothing his trusty walking boot cant fix
its duck time boys
bens a great faker one of theee best
and now hes on the covid list
how many times has this dude played hurt seriously we all remember when ngata broke his nose and didnt he finish the game
ben is like if shrek was a saiyan
i guess the refs arent taking money as payment anymore
bring out the painkillers
ben and his tall tales

dude loves to exaggerate how injured he is
listen up kids you want to know who was tough the elite mfing dragon thats who is tough joe took the same hits as ben he would just go out there and play torn acl fuck you all i can line up in shotgun you didnt hear about it from joe sometimes until weeks after hed been hurt like a thigh injury that limited him for half a season remember kiko alonso knocking him out on a dirty play you probably do remember what joe said about it afterward it was an nfl play never complained and if he could help it you never even knew

fuck this drama queen
lol this is so on point the second i saw this i was likeim sure he will say im fine and sure enough lol
at least we dont have to deal with him after this year since he said he was going to ride out his current deal and then who knows whats gonna happen to a broken down ben
is pittsburghs backup still hodges andor rudolph
he hasnt reached his final form yet
i dont get why so many people in here insist that he fakes injuries the man took an absurd amount of sacks in the first half of his career and that wear and tear builds up hes avoided season ending injury most of the time but i guarantee you hes been playing with chronic pain for a long time adrenaline takes care of most of that once the game gets going but as an athlete i can tell you the day after is brutal this is why hes constantly on the injury report also the nfl requires teams to report injuries accurately so ben is supposed to be honest about whatever pain hes feeling its not drama its him following protocol

i understand why it gets old hearing about how tough he is from commentators all the time i really do i dont really think he should be praised any more than any other player since i promise you most linemen and other guys who deal with the bulk of the contact are dealing with chronic pain in some way from all the built up damage to their bodies its part of the game of football however to suggest that ben is faking injuries is asinine hes injured just not seriously enough to keep him out of the game hes not on social media whining about how much pain hes in hes just listed on the injury report because hes required to be if hes injured thats it its not his fault the media jumps all over it every time
dude is tough as nails but football has likely messed up his body for life
you know i wish one of the chicks he raped took him out maybe he will reinjure his elbow beating off to porn seriously fuck ben
when people were talking about ben being back this year i said he wont make it through the season without injuries its been awhile since he played all 16 games in a season

edc at it again
ravens cb tavon young agreed to a reworked deal in which 2514m of his base salary for 2020 was converted into a signing bonus amp his nonguaranteed 55m base salary in 2021 was dropped to 265m guaranteed cap space for ravens guarantees for young who has been oftinjured

github whatsnew
wonder if that means they are gonna try and pickup another corner
its looking like we are going to sign someone then probably tramon williams to a one year deal
probably a good deal for both sides

ravens get some cap space this yearnext year tavon gets more guaranteed money and virtually assures that hes gonna be on the team in 2021 so he wont be looking for a new team coming off an acl tear in a year where the cap is much lower
nice seems like a fair deal for both sides and helps us with cap space
i really wish he could stay healthy when he has been on the field hes really solid
i honestly really like this not only do we get to cut his salary because of the injuries but in case he comes back and does something we can keep him tavon is a really good cb that just has shit luck with injuries the question is how will he recover and if he has a good recovery and avoids future injuries this could be an excellent deal
hes not the guy i wouldve chosen for a restructure

duv needs more touches look no further than snead getting ran down by spillane for reasons why
duv is fast af
get that man the ball
his acceleration when he turns the corner on that kick return is insane
duvernay is speed
duvernay needs to get the ball more

fuck covidfuck the steelers
vaccine news is promising at least
fuck the steelers but i hope nobody gets it too bad

x200b

except maybe the rapist
they have all the luck so im sure hell pass all his tests and be back for the game
damn hopefully its all good
does this affect playing time on sunday big ben is on that list
not only did flacco pass montana in yardage for his career but he did it by doing what he did for the majority of his career in baltimore chucking up a beautiful deep ball for a td to non other than perriman

2020 is wild
to perriman no less
where was this dynamic duo 35 years ago
plus that ending was classic 2minute flacco

jets need to get in field goal range or at least move the chains to burn some clock flacco checksdown gets sacked and then overthrows a guy to go 3andout leaving the opponent enough time to march down the field and score a field goal of their own
freejoe
looked like 20102012 joe
the current usage of iconic is approaching wholesome status but i do agree with the gist of your idea
1115 snf at patriots

1126 thanksgiving snf thanksgiving special at steelers

123 tnf vs cowboys

1214 mnf at browns

out of all of these games the only home game is tnf against dallas im hoping wear all black for that game
nice get to have my sunday afternoons free
thursday into thursday into monday is amazing scheduling for us if you have to have 2 thursday games back to back is the best way to do it and then we go from the second one into an 11 day break before a monday night game
and suddenly it sucks to live in europe
hard to believe thanksgiving is just two weeks away
this will be fun a great chance to redeem themselves after the only other primetime ravens game this season and the only non primetime game in this mix is the titans excited

also fyi edit the 1126 to tnf
makes me feel like a fool for getting sunday ticket this season
we could honestly go 40 in these games cowgirls will be starting some random qb along with an awful defense we can probably play at 70 and beat them pats d is still decent but their offense is devoid of playmaking and cam is broken right now steelers we already almost beat while having 100 penalty yards and 4 turnovers if we cut down mistakes we should definitely beat them andthe browns are the browns we should be sitting at 102 and maybe the steelers will have lost another one and well be in good position to take the division i mean at worst id see us getting through this at 22 i just dont think the cowboys or pats have the offensive ability to beat us even when our offense sucks we end up scoring over 20
hooray i can watch just redzone instead of redzone on my tv and the ravens on my computer now
fuck

as a european using gamepass this is a royal pita because the new layout spoils the results since this season

edit i found how to hide the scores its a weird ass button but its right there when you click on your account name how did i miss that
as a fan in europe this is going to wreck my sleep schedule
ugh gonna have to tell my boss that i need a few days off it seems
41 record in the next 5 with a win vs pitt is preferred if not 50 32 could really suck seeing as how we should end the season on a 30 streak would much rather be trending 133 than 124 since pitt is still undefeated late in the season
i love how the one that isnt primetime is against the titans which would make one of the better primetime games
time for lamar to prove he can win big primetime games and shut everybody up lets remind them why he won mvp last year
i loved when we wore black jerseys and purple pants vs the browns it looked fucking sick
somehow im working all of those
theres no chance we dont black out our jerseys right
here in the uk and very envious just booked 4 more mornings off work cheers for the update
damnit i work the 3rd and 14th
not really good to wake up at 2 am in europe
hi everyone sorry if this post doesnt fit here im trying to figure this out and i appreciate all the help in advance

my name is isaac im from new york me and my girlfriend are diehard ravens fans and weve been dying to go to a game together i noticed that the november 22nd game at home against the titans is limited attendance and i wanted to know how if possible i could get my hand on some tickets i read online that they offer the tickets to season ticket holders only and if by the off chance anyone here has season tickets and cant attend id love to purchase the tickets from you

her birthday is that week and it would be so amazing if we could drive down for a game

thank you all and go ravens
for the steelers game a lot of season ticket holders sold on stubhub anyway just be prepared to pay several times face value
i heard they let the season holders have first dibs the other tickets will be released to the public a few days before the game
theres a lottery for tickets season ticket holders i think are first up for them and i think anyone else who wants them probably has to go stubhub for people selling tickets they got to buy through the lottery

the live production nerd in me is only looking at that epic rigging and line array waaaaaay up there

such a great shot
shawn hubbard is the goat of nfl photography his work is epic
they literally have a banner for their 410 wild card loss in 2002 lmao
watch out they make try to steal him in the middle of the night along with most of those banners
looking at all those banners


i was thinking about this recently i dont think we really have that one iconic wr but maybe im just not remembering someone i know weve always had problems getting wrs but out of everyone weve had who do you think is the best
best receiver that has played for the ravens steve smith sr best ravens receiver derrick mason easy
derrick mason

people will say boldin for his playoff perfomance when we won the super bowl but mason was a better all around receiver and was with the team for twice as long
count me in for derrick mason as well

he was such a critical part of the team in those early flacco years ill never forget him catching a td with a dislocated shoulder i think thats what it was some kind of shoulder injury against dallas in 2008
id lean toward anquan boldin though derrick mason and steve smith sr are good options too
tandon doss
mason
boldin
smith sr

smith sr is the best of the 3 but his time in baltimore was limited
michael jackson rip
derek mason
dez
boldin
best homegrown is torrey and best ever is derrick mason
i gotta go with steve smith sr he was just so physical for his size and sooooooo much fun to watch he was born to be a raven and should 100 be in the hof

boldin is my 2nd choice had a great career also hof worthy imo and was huge in getting us a superbowl

mason might be the default answer for most bc he was here longer than boldin and ssr so he has more yards and what not but he was not better than those 2 still love him though
the fact that nobody has said randy hymes proves to me that this sub is full of bots and bandwagoners
1 derrick mason
2 these spots
3 intentionally left
4 blank out of respect
5 for derrick mason
6 anquan boldin
7 torrey smith
8 hollywood brown
michael jackson
yeah the problem is the best weve managed to draft was torrey and we didnt bother keeping him
boldin the most important in terms of team history crucial to the sb win
im with everyone on mason
anquan boldin its not his fault he didnt have as many years as others and we all saw what happened to the offense after flacco never got another receiver at the same level
strictly ravens tenure mason

best in playoffs q

best ever to be a raven no matter the duration to if you count the two days he was a raven lol

if not which is understandable its a tie between q and sssr
campanaro
mason by a long shot im 24 and mason was all i knew throughout my childhood on 3rd and long it was either him or heap every time
man yall crazy it torrey smith
i feel like if travis taylor had player with better qbs hed be in this conversation but since he didnt id go with boldin mason had more good years but boldin is the only time its felt like we had a wr that could dominate the other teams defense
id say boldin but mason and smith sr are great picks as well
just want to say that when derick mason was on our team our number 1 target was always todd heap yes mason was our only good wr for many years and spent more years on our team than boldin or ssrbut he doesnt deserve to rank higher than boldin or ssr
mason for sure but i loved jacoby jones
not much love for jacoby in this thread maybe he wasnt the best true wr but i dont think theres an offensive player who made more miraculous plays than he did im considering kr touchdowns as miraculous plays if youre wondering
mason

boldin

torrey

sssr

its a pretty steep cliff after that
1 mason
2 bold in
3 steve smith
4 torrey smith
jeremy maclin
breshad perriman

my exact words were its a close game why would you waste a timeout on a stupid challenge stood corrected
i was surprised too but colts fans really need to shut up about that call thats not why they lost they lost cuz rivers is washed and cant do anything when they actually play a good defense
harbaugh pulled a very belichick move having a better understanding of the rule book than the fans announcers and refs respect it super bowl guaranteed
ive always liked the idea of challenging big plays if it doesnt work you get like a four minute time out anyways if it works your team is rewarded it only bites you back if youre in a two minute drill playing from behind but weve always had pretty good clock management so it didnt phase me
am i the only one who thought it was a catch that was my first reaction he took 45 steps with the ball in his possession then lost it on his was down i thought it was a catch and fumble the whole way through
thought it was dumb but i was wrong according to gene 3 steps with ball contact constitutes control

hoping to pick up some tickets and attend but no secondary market tickets are showing up yet

anyone have an idea when they are being put up for sale with psl owners
psl owners have submitted requests for the lottery the ravens organization will begin fulfilling those requests tomorrow november 11 once tickets are paid for the owners will be transferred the mobile tickets thats my understanding anyway

if buyers dont pay they get offered to another owner it can take a few days for all tickets to be allocated
i was wanting to do the same thing for the titans game or cowboys i emailed the ravens ticket people what that guy said plus any leftover tickets will be put on the market a few days before the game
im really hoping they arent too expensive

torrey smith genuinely good guy
i love torrey so much
torrey is a great baltimorean regardless of where he plays or lives

we are partnering with recnparks to run the programming at hilton rec center we have been working for over a year to figure out how we can maximize the potential that we see in baltimore visit

i feel like the biggest question mark is offensive play calling but im more confident in this team after the second half of the colts game
i feel confident that well win at least one playoff game who knows after that were incredibly good but also flawed too
injuries worry me more than the performance right now
i prefer us as the underdogs so if we dont win the divison and have to play one more game to not be a top 4 seed with high expectations im ok with that
i feel its gonna be an uphill climb to win the division but with how well weve been playing in the road i dont think thatll make much difference just gotta hope we get seeded well for the playoffs then lets win a fucking game fuck
im worried less about the play calling and more worried about the execution and depth on the oline

i dont love all the play calling but hope its being used the right way to hide our weaknesses and exploit the favorable matchups loved the high tempo change up to start the second half

i worry when our injuries catch up with us losing stanley is a tough pill to swallow calais will be back but when etc
idk if we win the division the steelers are pretenders tho abd they will be exposed on thanksgiving and then i predict theyre out the first round of the playoffs

i think we hvae the ability to go all the way if roman isnt a total fucking idiot and calls the games the way he did on sunday and he lets lamar play to his strengths im worried about kc obvs but thats really it although i could obviously see us losing to other teams if we dont fix the playcalling
i think we definitely have the potentially to go all the way even with all the injuries we have the talent on d to stop the chiefs we just need some offensive consistency on the part of lamar and roman to match that ill never count us out cuz the league is unpredictable lots of stuff can happen and there can be lots of calls that help us and go against us if bad roman and turnover lamar show up again in the playoffs were going 1 and done again but if the offense actually moves the ball and we can keep mahomes off the field and we beat the chiefs we can win the super bowl vs any nfc team
the o line and wrs are my biggest worries
i feel were good but im always skeptical about how were going to play

i realize lamar can get a lot of flack on our losses but adapting from one of the best olines suited for him to one that is below that can be difficult and really ruin your groove

our defense plays amazingly and allows lamar the ability to be able to make mistakes it seems like when lamar is hot our team is unstoppable i think it all starts with the run game beating that dead horse and when lamar gets comfortable playing he goes off

this season is going to rest on roman and lamar our defense will step up as they always have if lamar is hot well win games but if hes not its up to roman to tailor our offense to allow lamar to gain confidence we saw how roman can mess up play calling with the steelers and im hoping it doesnt happen again this season
fine
cautiously optimistic because im a ravens fan and i know how we do
i dont know if theyre hoping he gets injured or what be all i ever hear is hes gonna get hurt and shit like that hes no more likely to get hurt than anyone else imo i feel like a qb getting blind sided in the pocket is more dangerous than getting tackled open field also why doesnt anyone say that about anyone else kyler murray russ mahomes etc if any of them get hurt their team is in a much worse position immediately yet its only discussed about lamar so annoying
there will be a twitter parade if he ever gets hurt
look at daks injury hes not even a run oriented qb and he got hurt football is a dangerous sport and injury is a possibility for anyone however if you look at the way lamar runs he doesnt really take big hits and his agility is so insane he just bends out of stuff that would kill a guy like philip rivers and makes it just look soft he still needs to work on sliding but hes protected himself well this year that is just a dumb media talking point coming from dudes who dont even watch our games
rothlesberger had a major injury last year and is banged up brees had a big injury rodgers has had many manning had a few season enders garrapolo is on ir currently mahomes dislocated his knee last year yet i somehow never hear how pocket passers are likely to get injured
maybe playing qb just lends yourself to being injured
i never understood why mobile qbs get this stereotype when aaron rodgers got injured a lot
op this isnt a bad take in fact this is probably a correct take but i think youre misconstruing what hurt means

big bens arm tom bradys knee peytons neck rodgers clavicle or for a recent example daks and kyle allens ankle all freak accidents and if lamar has anything similar to this it will be that a freak accident and in no part due to the fact he runs a ball

however when someone insights extra contact they will get hurt this is why rbs have such a short career after all there body wears down over time and weve seen this in other quarterbacks before whether is andrew luck who just took so much punishment his body had something nagging all the time or like cam newton whos physical style ended up with him needing surgery and learning to correct his throwing motion

thats my fear with lamar that in 7 years the punishment he has taken may make it harder to stay on the field or leave him damaged in a way that is not so easily treated

why isnt this brought up with kyler russ josh allen or the like they dont have 12 rushing attempts a game they are using their arms to set up their legs where as lamar uses his legs and the run game as a whole praise be the gus bus to set up his arm he didnt get compared to michael vick for nothing the dude runs like a lot i just hope he can start cutting back and work on being a pocket passer at an elite level not just a qb at an elite level
its a nice indicator that the analyst doesnt actually watch film so you can easily dismiss whatever they say just ignore these people and youll no longer be tired of them
saying a football player is going to get hurt is like saying its going to rain some day of course it will rain eventually
this year

dak moderately mobile

allen pocket passer

darnold pocket passer

lock pocket passer

garappolo pocket passer

last year

brees pocket passer

mahomes pocket passer

alex smith moderately mobile

last ten years
carson pocket passer

brady pocket passer

flacco pocket passer

am i missing some running qbs sure but there are a lot of statutes getting rolled up on
mahomes literally fucked up his knee cap and yet no one is concerned about his shelf life

on that note tho i hope that lamar goes the russel wilsontom brady route and decides to spend a 1 million of self care on his body a year i want to see lamar play a long time and spending that much money to still play a long time just seems like a minor investment in my eyes
no one says this about allen or murray murray is excellent at avoiding contact but is arguably much more fragile in terms of buildheightframe



coach has two copies of the q factor and the harry potter books showing lol
i hope they never stop doing these with billick he is so interesting to listen to
loved that heads up play by gus edwards 041

yay its time to bully a few more practice squad patriots receivers
nice ball shame if someone punched it
hopefully he stops going out all the time now
receivers should just slide when humphrey comes there way
please for the love of god marlo stop that ball had a family
is this confirmed
did anyone order fruit punch
ravens by 60 this week

loved that heads up play by gus edwards at 041


should this really be attributed to harbaugh i would think someone in the booth would be making that call most of the time
wait when was the 3 challenge game
quick question do you work directly for the ravens organization cause these graphics looks just like the ones the media team puts out
didnt tomlin have like a 2 year streak of no challenges won his rate is higher than i would have expected
this kind of stat is interesting and i think the tomlinharbaugh comparison is fair but for coaches who have been around significantly longer bb reid and priorera guys this really needs to be eraadjusted back when they didnt automatically review all scoring plays and automatically review anything close that they decided they want to there was a lot more lowhanging fruit to make successful challenges and drive that percentage up
bruh we never get calls go our way

in case anyone wants to be reminded of the disappointing losses all day at work
removed

so hes 37 but pff had him as a top 10 corner last season and he played all 16 games i think this is a low risk high reward signing
rest of the league is happy now that they dont have to face terrell bonds the goat anymore
hes amazing for such a old guy almost every packer fan wanted him back but we didnt have room on our roster hes a veteran who knows the game and plays amazing despite his old age hes a fantastic player both on and off the field and is a great leader for the younger guys
another reason for rogerstojordy to just become a ravens fan already
good we desperately need depth and adding a veteran will always help
yesssss hes still playing good even though hes older pretty versatile to id still prefer jimmy and peters on the outside with marlon in the slot when everyones healthy id like to see him play the role jimmy was doing early in the seasoncarrs role last year

bottom line hes better than bonds and averrett so im happy
on top of a good pff rating his highlights in the comments are nice

the important takeaway is that he should start in place of bonds fairly quickly he was lined up in the slot for most of the plays in that video the fact he played a full season in 2019 just makes the signing even better
tramon has always been amazing for us he is a stellar veteran cb im sad to see him go but i hope yall do great with him
as part packer fan i love this his pick six against atlanta in the divisional round against atlanta will always give me chills
slot is locked up hes still able to play at a high level
jimmys knees sent edc a large fruit basket for this signing jimmy is still th0
i cant here to ask if brandon carr was dead but judging by the comments maybe this guy is just better
i mean at this point we just need warm bodies so im fine with this
this signing will get 1 as much attention as dez and will be 50x more impactful
this is a great late season signing for a position of serious need now marlon can play outside a bit more and the rookies will have time to grow into their roles
we have signed cb tramon williams to the 53man roster and placed khalil dorsey shoulder on ir

we have also signed ot rj prince and db nate brooks to the practice squad

how did we sign tramon to the 53 man but dez had to go through the practice squad i am so confused

thats awesome man congrats
frame that asap
dont listen to people they know what they are talking about when it comes to a majority of what that have to say
what is pff
god damn thats amazing beautiful honestly a little jealous haha
i unapologetically love florio

because roman has no creativity
imo it isnt that our offense is predictable many teams repeat plays in games the ravens repeated the same run 2 or 3x in a row against indy in goal line to go up 1410

the problem w the ravens offense is their lack of creativity in the passing game its extremely archaic greg cosell called it rudimentary remedial

romans passing games were archaic rudimentary in nature in sf and buf as well those passing offenses utilized all of the field via deep sideline passing and were still archaic thus this notion that our passing game is archaiclimited because lamar doesnt attack deep sideline isos is bs its archaic because greg roman is poor at scheming a creative passing game

last season the ravens were middle of the pack in terms of creating open throws in the passing game the chiefs were top 3 the ravens are even worse at that now while the chiefs remain top 3

im honestly not expecting anything to change on gros front i expect our passing game to continue to be archaic in nature itll be up to lamar and the weapons to make the best of it imo lamar getting back to his 2019 form from a decision making standpoint would do a lot to help this offense

last yr i said that lamar made gro look better than he was not the other way around note that i said that while the majority of rnfl and sports media were calling this dude a wizard a future head coach i hope he does become a future head coach soon plz jets hopefully we keep his run game stuff and build a real passing attack when he bounces

hes a wizard as a run game architect but thats about it hes an advisorconsultant type hes no mcvay shanahan kubiak or reid hes a tier or 2 below all of those guys
our route concepts in the passing game are very predictable we are going to pay for that in the playoffs even if we win one game that would prevent us from going all the way
i still think we need one game where we say fuck it and unapologetically run the ball down someones throat we kinda been doing it in 2nd halfs but the way our o line is built id love for us to go 8020 runpass run some 22 13 or 21 personnel groups really just show the run and basically just show that even when you know its coming you cant stop us

i also think unlike most teams and most norms being down 1 or 2 scores shouldnt mean abandoning the run we can rip 20yd runs left and right it should never go away it almost guarantees we lose when the run game disappears
i just wish we had 45 formations for the entire offense but had 200300 different plays out of those formations


nobody cares work harder
this is getting tired who cares
boo hoo
its more of a power rankings so i dont see how its ridiculous lamar has not played like a top 10 quarterback through 10 weeks its not all his fault but thats the way it is
who cares
seems about right
jesus christ nobody cares besides they arent exactly wrong id put him a bit higher but he hasnt played like a top ten qb since week 1 some people on this sub are so soft when lamar isnt like a top ten qb in every single power ranking theres a big difference between just hating on lamar and actual criticism of him recently more often than not its been valid criticism that people have been whining about
its based on this season so it makes sense but all truly know hes hes way better than that
damn this is total bs they have matt ryan big ben and derek carr ahead of lamar are people forgetting he played the top 2 defenses in the nfl last week smh
money man marlo is going to be playing rock em sock em robots with the patriots receivers tomorrow
sloppyballz
man been at home for a week just punching air anyways prolly walking around his home with the arthur first waiting for this game
under under under under
love rain games we gonna run all over dem boyz lmaoooo
lmao imagine thinking the patriots will make a completion
jk fuck the pats big truzz
woo woo
already
just got bucked
its that easy is it really that easy to get upvotes my god
they had us in the first half im not gonna lie
lets goooo
got me you bastard
you had me there for a second
dude that title got me i almost lost it on you was halfway through a seething message before i calmed myself said wait lets see what heshe had to say
fuck the pats all day every day

does anyone like retired bernard pollard lol
pollard eat a dick you werent even the best safety on our team let alone the league nobody gives a fuck what you think your nfl legacy ends where bradys knee brace begins
wow dude is a serious hater lolall his tweets consist of nascar and ravens hate wtfff
i get someone saying lamar isnt a top 5 qb or having him lower in your qb rankings than the average ravens fan but has this shit really turned into people saying hes not even good good isnt even some absurdly large hurdle to jump lamar is still good
imagine holding a grudge 8 years later because your bum ass couldnt get a job after getting released lmao
imagine having such a serious hate boner for the only team you were ever any good with
what exactly happened with him and the ravens that brought on all this vitriol
torrey is a raven forever mane
this idiot is just spewing shitty lamar takes to try and stay relevant which he is not just ignore his ass
piece of trash trying to stay relevant
he literally cant even explain it himself back to that one dude broke bitch kam chancellor great value headass
why does he even care how lamar plays hes not a raven anymore hes not even in the league anymore does he want attention
how are you gonna play on a team with joe flacco and call lamar jackson a bad qb
i remember when bernard pollard got released and had a strong box score with the titans and all the ravens fans bitched about him being gone and how the ravens released a really good player with a strong personality

now everyone just hates the guy

we actually had both of them represent the ravens
im a u of m fan so i get both lol
i dont necessarily think its all jims fault to their underperformance every year i mean im not a michigan fan and i dont got a dog in the fight but i think its their expectations that are incorrect mike greenberg did a really nice piece on it
to be fair this could also be a cautionary tale and could very well be us in a couple of years hopefully not though
ahhh
sleep in its an evening game
rooting hard for you guys tonight we love you
hopefully we can get rolling and defeat the pats once again when was the last time bal had a winning streak against ne
im actually up for one of these fuck the pats

the ravens and poorly aged memes love to see it



original if anyone is interested
howd that work for you guys
on them we shall stunt
holy shit i drive my gf nuts watching this all the time and then i kinda tapered off now you gave me another reason to you are my hero
its pretty much there in the title im leaving this afternoon to start a long road trip to my new home a couple thousand miles outside my beloved baltimore ill settle for streaming the game on my radio while driving anyone have recommendations on whats the best way to tune in
fortunately its sunday night football so you ought to be able to hear it called on sports stations throughout your drive

check the westwood station finder to know the best signal to tune into the game

have a safe and good trip
i think xm has it but not sure
the actual ravens app should have the radio broadcast available to you
its snf so the game will be on westwood one you should easily be able to listen in the whole game no matter what state you are in you may just need to find what station is westwood one in each state
tune in radio app has bailed me out before use the free trial and you dont have to pay anything
satellite radio
you can get a portable kit with an fm transmitter
try it for a week and decide you dont like it

here is a bigger better noncropped version of the same image

the next time we meet the chiefs we will out mahome mahomes lol
van noy is a dolphin and hightower is sitting out this year
been watching all this stuff all week about romans play calling being predictable and outdated which may be slightly true however lamar also needs to reflect a bit as well it shouldnt matter if the defense knows whats coming because when lamar is playing at his top tier they cant stop him even when they know whats coming hes explosive in the pass and run game when hes at his best and roman calls those plays thinking that lamar is going to be at his best and weve seen lamar hesitate much more this year than he did last lamar doesnt need to worry about if the option is predictable when he is explosive enough to make defenders mess up on any play

i always think of the greatest closer mariano rivera the man threw one pitch a cut fastball everyone knew it was coming and it didnt matter because no one could hit it thats where lamar needs to be at not going on talk shows talking about how defenses are calling out plays or romans schemes are vanilla lamar needs to stunt on these hoes no matter what the play call is because he has that ability get that confidence back lamar that you can beat anyone
make sure to tell lamar just play better
lamar wasnt the only one to call roman out fans noticed hollywood sent that tweet and apparently mark andrews said something as well how can he be solely responsible for being confident with playcalling that majority of the offense is not happy with
its not about confidence we go over this daily time and time and again read the 100 other posts discussing this
bro im convinced people on here dont even watch football what the fuck is this take man

he was saying they call out plays all the time and are usually wrong its just a tactic defenses use and even when defenses knew the play they couldnt always stop it lamar cant let it get to him and needs to dominate even if the defense does know the play
bruschi always struck me as being a smug jackass hope hes healthy and doing alright physically after that stroke but otherwise i never liked the guy
you know how many times i try to call out a peyton manning play and i was wrong

i dont think lamar says this if theyre wrong though
teddy is one of the ignorant bill believers that thanks the patriots are still super bowl contenders i wouldnt read too much into it
is that matt well take the ball and were gonna score hasselbeck talking about hot button things you can say as a player that crushes a coach
wow an intelligent conversation that wasnt just greg roman bashing
teddy bruschi is a clown just like that other espn analyst dan orlovsky
brushchi is a hateful pos thats all i came to say
why do they keep acting like he said theyre out here calling out pass and run he said they know our plays thats a little different
hes right lamar needs to mature a little

this is so damn sad saw this in the baltimore and maryland subs as well just heartless to do this to someone truly hoping she can be found
ah man im so sorry i cant imagine what youre going through i hope someone comes forward

just curious does rosie have a chip you might be able to reach out to local vets to give them a heads up
i hope mods let this stay up and you find her safe and sound
man i feel for you bro this is fucked up on another level hope you get her home safe man
ugh let us know if you have any luck
god i wish i could help you but im not in the baltimore area im from virginia hope you find her though this is so fucked up
id give you a hug if i could
ill post this on my insta story i hope you find your dog

where do i report this not being ravens related

trash ass games damn
fuck the steelers
i long for the day the ravens finally get a bonifide all pro receiver like deandre fucking hopkins what an absolute beast
geez i hate when we play the nightlate games i am just counting the hours till we play and it makes sunday sooooo long in not a good way
til alex collins still plays in the nfl
daniel lamar jackson jones
two former ravens from the 2013 squad aq shipley and ryan jensen now make up 25ths of tampa bays oline with starting left guard ali marpet out today jensen moves to guard in the interim while shipley takes over jensens spot at center
i really hope texans win and i think they def can
whoa nelly arizona wins it on a hail mary td from murray to hopkins

man what a game that was
thanks for nothing houston
td alex collins
fuck the steelers checking in
gonna sound like a broken record but still pissed that we didnt draft diggs we desperately have needed wr for basically our whole existence have a talented stud from right in our backyard and passed on him multiple times in the draft

edit and now hopkins caught a hail mary in triple coverage
wow that was amazing
fuck the useless bengals
that hail mary was amazing and the bufari game in general was a great game glad ari won
fuck the bengals
this billscardinals game has been nuts buffalo just took the lead 3026 with only 34 seconds left
cant depend on houston for shit

or the bungles as a matter of fact fucking useless
im annoyed that theres no cbs game and instead of watching texans browns we have to watch wft
nothing goes our way second week in a row
latest weather update for the game shows that thee 1st half should be rain free while the 2nd half should dump rain im hoping it stays more dry lamar hasnt played his best games in the rain
the amount of terrible penalty calls in these games today is making me nervous for tonight
the bengals need to bench burrow until they can protect him with something better than wet toilet paper gonna ruin that guys career
i want to see tom brady loss again
holy shit only 5 noon games and 6 4pm games what gives
took a fat ass l taking hollywood before

also boykin is trash
im finding myself rooting against kyler murray which is a damn shame
is it 820pm yet
so we dont get the browns or the steelers games in baltimore today
dustin johnson made the masters a snoozer
for our sake i hope zac taylor is the bengals coach for a long time that team has more talent than 4 wins in 25 games or whatever it is since he took over
one order of dhop please
anyone tell me where i can find a live free feed of the ravens game tonight

i bet on the ravens winning by 14 im feeling pretty good about it
just curious i cant find much information on it
geno was called up maybe that put us at 53 probs need more secondary help than wr
its going to be rainy so more runs on offense hopefully and needed depth in the secondary we can also only activate him from the ps a certain number of times
cam fumbles its raining geno hits hard dez probably just isnt ready yet which we shouldve expected hopefully hes ready for the cowboys game which is when we want him most
nasty weather
fyi there are currently only 52 players on the active roster this was also the case last week they are apparently keeping that 53rd spot open for someone perhaps an eventual ir returnee eg tyre phillips or potential outside signing such as luke willson

initially i would have thought dez bryant was going to grab that slot however he still has another callup left before that becomes a necessity same goes for geno stone who got a freebie last week for technically replacing a covid list player in marlon humphrey thus tonight counts as 1

teams can have 55 active for game day but can only dress a maximum of 48 however to activate said number there must be at least 8 ol dressed baltimore has made sure to do just that all season long

still it seems strange to only have 52 on the active roster plus only call up one ps player when theyre allowed 2 each week this is especially peculiar considering how shorthanded they are at both ot te respectively

it would be extremely bad to lose 1 player at either one of those positions also what happens if they lose both ots similar to how they lost 2 players capable of playing ot vs pit obviously neither will holden nor rj prince are good enough to even warrant temporary promotions

i certainly dont want to see mekari playing rt let alone have to find out the hard way who would man the lt position in such a scenario i suppose the only logical lineup in that instance would become this bozemanbredesonskurapowersmekari better hope boyle stays healthy

i wonder who the 5 inactive players will be tonight i can come up with these 4 easily trace mcsorley calais campbell jimmy smith lj fort since ingram is back justice hill seems like a candidate despite st contributions i sure hope versatile jihad ward isnt the 5th scratch
weather plus he could use another week learning the offense plus we can only call him up once more before we have to sign him to the 53 if im correct

plus even though its the pats this is a game we should win without any extra help any given sunday of course but analytically we should save dez for a game we might need him maybe thanksgiving
ill ask the coach next time i see him
because we needed to call up geno stone for more depth in the secondary besides mans was probably just gonna run block for two snaps anyways especially considering that its gonna start raining heavy in boston
go listen to what jason la canfora said on the rich eisen show earlier this week basically our expectation was that dezs first game would be on thanksgiving but duvernay was banged up all week before the colts game so we activated dez just in case
he no good no more yet
because he is on the practice squad
we have depth needed at other positions right now plus the coaches may not be happy where he is at right now

he isnt going to bring what everyone is hoping he will i hope im wrong but i just dont see it
because greg romans playbook only calls for passes to hollywood and andrews

all jokes aside it sounds like the coaches arent seeing the same guy from 3 years ago he only had 2 snaps last week

this aged beautifully


perriman
queen

time to come out and blast cam on all those called qb runs he can go along way in that rookie defensive player of the year voting with a play making game on national tv
queen
im jealous
queen or marlo im thinking queen
tucker the
mount these on a wall buy a ravens sweatshirt never fucking ever wear another mans jersey ok though if your brother plays and youre in a wheelchair
only local game on tv is the washington and detroit game ok game but not great teams

the browns and texans game looks awful when they show a highlight good

cant wait for tonight
laptop and an hdmi cable and you can watch any game i have to use it down here in florida to get raven games it really is nice being able to watch them without spending any money
cbs had the masters rights and i dont think nfl wanted to compete with that anyways
red zone surely


lmao why he looks like a villain
he reminds me of the villain from the princess and the frog but with a mustache
he looks like he wants to kidnap you and make you perform in a traveling circus
whys he look like little richie with braids
i didnt know r kelly got out of jail and started playing for the ravens
jafar jackson
california raisin looking ass
no thanks sticking with the funko pops
now that is lemib jibsplib
it says choking hazard not exactly wrong
anyone know alex collins was back in the nfl i had no clue
i liked alex collins some games but does anyone remember how he would always try to bounce runs to the outside and often lose yards
running great so far todaywhat could have been
apparently he signed to the seahawks practice squad on nov 4 news to me too
sure did but john brown is the one you wish was still a raven
lamar coming in was the end of his time in baltimore all the bouncing runs outside when you have lamar back there wasnt cutting it
im glad for him that hes worked his way back into the league he seemed like a good guy other than that dumbass pot citation just throw the stuff in the woods while youre waiting for the cops man

he wouldnt be a great fit in romans offense but hed still be useful in an outside zone run team

he was so fun to watch his one good year with us i wish things could have worked out but i think dobbins will be even better for us
wheres the irish jig disappointed but glad to see hes back
glad he back in the league at least now he can wreck his car with a legal amount of weed on board minus the firearm
oml seahawks are always so unlucky with runningback injuries im happy for collins nonetheless
looks dope wearing 41 kinda like kamara
good for alex he juked that guy at the ten into space
dude was so stupid when he was here with us you gonna be a football player and a drug dealer on the side
just dancing his way in
damn i remember the around the time after he got cut i dapped him up at the charles in fed hill
hes back happy for him honestly hopefully he turned his life around and had a great second chance in football dude balled out for us in his one year
did that guy really call him austin collins come on
i loved him he came thru for us hard that year he was also stepping into ray rices shoes
removed
sir this is a wendys
this is the last time i visit yalls sub bruh

we never get outside help

we also never cheer for our rivals in our house
neither did the cowboys or titans the jags or bills probably wont either if we want the steelers to lose we have to do it ourselves
if im being completely honest i almost dont want to win the division i want this team entering playoffs as wildcard with a chip on their shoulder get that underdog mentality that helped us win it in 2012 plus its gonna be really tough to catch pitt at this point in the season anyway theyve still got pretty much guarenteed 3 wins with cin cle and jax and we are 25 games behind if we win tonight
cincy fucking sucks lol they have no defense and they have no oline i didnt watch that game but burrow probably needs an extra long ice bath tonight
always leave it to the browns and bengals choking against the steelers
well it looks like were going to get another shot at giving them their first lossunless the jags pull an upset next week

jk dobbins
our coaches are so dense that theyd actually put ingram in as the starter over jk and gus remember jk was getting like 2 snaps a game when ingram was healthy
to be honest i love mark ingram to death but gus bus is the answer for the remainder of the year till the wheels fall off baby lets go
big boy no little boy
dont overthink it if ingram is active its likely he gets the most carries
i would play gus
jk gus ingram in that order
removed

how unfortunate
maybe our receivers group will look nfl caliber now
roman please let hollywood go off
let lamar cook
incoming haters saying lamar only got 5 touchdowns because no gilmore calling it here
huge
russell wilsonloses and plays like shit against good teams
russ just dropped further down if not completely out of the mvp race now

he alone accounts for 12 turnovers in the last month or so now

i have nothing against russ i actually like him but fuck those salty seahawks fans who continously trashed lamar no mvp for him again
yeeeah kyler definitely just validated the discussion espn has been fueling all week between him and lamar though
facts

judon doing juuuuust enough to get the bag from the jets
how can every team in the league scheme their receivers open except for the ravens
hollywood getting pissy is hilarious how the fuck can you average a catch a game and think you should get all the targets
lamars best passing game of the season and we score 17 points wtf is this team sometimes
i think we killed roman at halftime last week and were weekend at burnieing him
still pumped about that screen to duvernay that was great
stop the count
that was all on lamar but as a sidenote i thought hollywood was supposed to be fast dude looks average at best speedwise as of late
offensive playcalling looking much more like second half vs indy than first half vs indy very nice
the pic of lamar in the shades will forever be legendary
excuse me thats a hold
we are so fucked next week
whats the point of having souljas
whats the point of having souljas if they never get separation never
willie snead is our real number one
2026 224 yds 2 tds 1 int in pouring rain with a swiss cheese oline and greg roman

not bad for a running back
how about some love for mekari

dude stepped in at c rg and now rt and for the most part holds his own cant ask for much more from a udfa
not on the stat sheet but yannick with heavy pressure on 2nd and 3rd down got us off the field
if anyone blames lamar for this game they need to get their head out of their fucking ass
lamar is currently 33 53 yards on this drive
lmfao i missed the touchdown because they interrupted the broadcast to tell me a tornado is about to rip through new york apparently lol

what happened
loving the implication that we single handedly ended the pats dynasty last year
big ben is a rapist
i want to see more of brown and duv in space man that duv play was tight
lamar refusing to run with at least 8 yards of open grass on that second down shows me theyre coaching some of that instinct out of him
hill was being held so he couldnt see nice
whats the point of running wildcat with mark ingram when you have lamar jackson lamar is a better runner and passer than ingram
collinsworth is right for once lamar needs to be lamar if he takes off thats almost definitely a first down maybe 3rd and short too much of that this season
these live threads are toxic asf lol
i could never be a nfl player but i certainly couldnt be a punt returner fuck that
beautiful pressure by yannick there come on man we cant lose this game theyre giving it to us
our turnover streak going to end too
chuck clark with the big brain penalties like when he did a similar thing against buf last year he understands the situations so well
nick boyle is the better blocker by a mile
the first quarter lasted like 5 minutes lol
stop the count
the lack of truss in this game day thread is disturbing
that was all yannick two strait plays
dont worry guys im sure first round fireball hollywood brown will make a big play here at the end the pats have not been able to stop his explosiveness all night
brady or no brady still fuckin hate the pats
this is the team that struggled against the jets last week just walked right through us besides judons sack on the first drive theyve looked like shit
hill was getting held before that he was completely turned around so he had no idea but still sloppy play
that was soft we get held like that all the time
the ravens and getting owned by patriot gimmick plays

name a more iconic duo
derrick henrys gonna run for 250 yards against the ravens next week
collinsworth highlighting pernell mcphee while talking about judon lol

someone else doing the work while judon gets credit is a perfect summary of him
so this is the everything falls apart game

jeez speedy recovery nick
skura may have just cost us this game
that drive was fucking phenomenal
so derrick henry is definitely running for like 500 next week
time to recognize duvernay as our best receiver
hollywood is not a wr1 for the afc north speed can be replicated height and size cant
peters was getting held wherre the fuck was that flag
imagine trying to blame this loss on lamar lol
justice being held the entire way so he cant see the fair catch play
hill couldnt se the fair catch call because of the blatant holding making him face the wrong way
this drive feels like it couldve been straight out of 2019
ravens fans do 180s on lovinghating the defense so quickly lol
andrews got hit before he even had the ball lmao
let me guess that was lamars fault as well
ooo att lily got thicc
lamar is throwing dots but nobody can catch them amd hell still be blamed for the loss by the media
lamar gets so much shit but we are a 26 team without him
willie snead is our best receiver and people still shit on lamar as a passer
we are still in this fuck the doomers lets go offense
maybe judon is saving his energy for a paul kruger style playoff breakout
lmao what the hell is brown mad about get open and maybe youll get the ball
i think this drive decides if roman keeps his job
that was a ridiculous hold on peters
smart play by harbaugh going offsides for real
look at the guys lamar has to play with man jesus
no excuses we need to beat that pats team but half the defense out and half the oline out is rough against the greatest coach of all time

still so many goddamn mistake its gross
how the fuck is that not holding held so he cant see the fair catch called
blatant false start no call
unpopular opinion

i like the ravens
play calling is looking suspiciously creative did gro already lose play calling privelages
jesus fuck what a fast quarter
bonds fucking sucks
i imagine the deepest layer of hell chris collinsworth replaces your inner monologue voice
there was no need to make that kind of play even if we got an incomplete i trust tucker to make a long ass field goal
the throw itself wasnt overly bad the decision however to throw it to their best corner to a receiver whos tiny and wont fight for a ball is awful
why is andrews the only person who can catch
snead has been putting the team on his fucking back last few weeks
duv and snead the wombo combo
yannick a beast two times he blew the play up
did any hear that pterodactyl screech
hell of a tackle board
matt skura go fuck yourself
i cant say this enough fuck matt skura
ya its lamars fault we had to try and convert a 2nd and 26
for those that didnt catch the last minute of the arizonabuffalo game go look up the highlights that minute is proof that the ravens fo need to get lamar an elite wide receiver to pair with absolute fantastic finish to that game
lamar is getting so much time these receivers need to get separation
we should start of the season with at least 38 corners on the active roster
gus the mother fucking bus
ride the gus bus
are there any updates on peters yet really hope that wasnt serious
remember when we thought this was going to be a breakout season for hollywood with all of those offseason workout videos on instagram
brandon has been ruled out for the game w an ankle injury

if he cant go next wk king henry will wreck house nxt wk
mvp dual threat qb and you put your third best rb in wildcat on fourth down fire gro fuck
guys that is not judons fault what the fuck is that call
if we pull this off i will eat myself
take your time score win this shit
as much as i hate agreeing with collinsworth hes 100 right there i know lamar wants to be a passer first second and third but when youve got his speed and the first down is that wide open to run for you have to take that regardless of whos open you always take a first down especially one that easy
he said mark andrews is a fantastic blocker as he fell on his ass missing his block
european fans how are you guys holding up
snead has really picked up the last three games
deshon elliot gave up half the yards and the score there
we should not be relying on justice hill inside the 10
that was an extra 15 yards on the spot
you absolutely cannot lose this game against a dogshit football team with ten and pit coming up
why throw a 5050 ball to a guy shorter than half the people reading this thread
remember when we scored 2 tds under 2 minutes with no timeouts last year god that feels like a lifetime ago
lamar was looking so sharp before that pick i think hell bounce back from it
queen needs to borrow some of that deer antler extract from ray lewis in the offseason
luckily we stopped them for 3 instead of 6
to judons credit none of the commentators thought it was a foul
fuck man shout out those pats players who called the med team over
the team is annihilated by injuries playing absolutely awful questions with the offensive coordinator defense playing bad entire season looking extremely bleak 2020 ravens super bowl confirmed
lamar is so under appreciated for taking the weather poor blocking the lack of separation and the bad snaps in stride and making it work think before you try to call him out again ever
oline in shambles

center cant snap

wr dont know how to catch

only one te

lamar still makes things happen
my heart drops watching proche field those punts cant even imagine how difficult it is in this weather
im so pissed about boyle god damnit
the ol patriot foot slip
now please for the love of god use gus edwards
yeah tramon williams is our starting cb came a week ago were still in this game

x200b

yet somehow the narrative tonight is newton good lamar bad
ngakue looked real good those last two plays real good
so the snaps are seriously the dumbest problem a team can have
hollywood was targeted 6 times he caught 2 i dont want to hear shit about not using you dawgs souljas
of course it buckets down when its our last drive nothing goes our way
this is not lamars fault can only do so much with the team around him
the patriots could be 015 and i would still want to throw everything at them theyve been bigger rivals to us in the past 20 yrs than the browns lets fucking kill them
judon will get 4 sacks this game and have good enough numbers for a team to overpay him next year
beep beep bitch
applebees has rats
lamar jackson was 44 73 yards 145 ya 1583 perfect passer rating on that drive
lamar gonna have to throw 4 tds today
i got a big interview tomorrow so i appreciate all this clock chewing
holy shit theyre just running it every play and this defence is so helpless

our offense cannot fuck around next half

the pats are going to run the ball heavy and chew the clock
thats the most pathetic defense ive ever seen from us all year and two guys down now too what a shambles
fire roman right now literally get anyone else there
you have lamar why the fuck do you even need to try and run wildcat
that is an awful call on judon doesnt make a difference but that was not on judon
joe breshad put up a better fight last week the 2015 fucking ravens almost beat this team
ravens good play


refs we dont do that here
lamar is making good throws nobody wants to catch and he will be blamed if we lose cant wait for the media this week
this is legit lamar vs everyone right now
people out here shitting on lamar because of the int man is 2026 for 224 yards 2tds with a 1117 rating big truzzzzz
glad we punted that was the smart move
plays dont show up on the stat sheet but ngakuo is disruptive
remember everyones gonna say lamar lost this game
now how are we gonna see people flip this on lamar
might have been intentional by clark i think the right move
not a ravens or patriots fan but as a casual viewer i wonder whether that was a good penalty for baltimore to have


they wouldve almost certainly gotten the first down with only two yards to go and after they got the first down they wouldve been able to run out the clock conversely now the ravens will probably get the ball back
oh my god chuck was playing 4d chess on the field
the amount of dobbins im not seeing is already pissing me off
unpopular opinion but ingram shouldnt get too many touches he doesnt look as great as he did last year bus and dobbins have been better this year
if the ravens win by 7 points i will win 800 on my parlay come on boys lets run em down ingram baby
need iv snead
thats a passing touchdown too
lamar you owe snead a ruth chris dinner after he gifted you that passing td
lamar jackson in the same category as oj simpson hopefully on the field only
we had 4 dudes there to make a play there
of course cam remembers how to play football when he plays us jfc
looks like calais campbell is a bigger deal on that dline than i thought
fuck were definitely missing campbell and jimmy smith smith was having a pro bowl season
the notion that hollywood is a number one is hilarious
hows that a hold
yo ingram in commercials now
just imagine what ole poop braid is gonna do to us next weekend
everytime we play the pats that works do we not coach that turn your head around and play the ball
that gave me serious ptsd from 2014
terrible coverage by queen on the trick play
1 catch in the first half for marquise

incoming souljas tweet by the end of the night
snead is our wr1 lmao
hollywood brown nowhere near open again 0for3
is it too goddamn much to ask for a true no1 wr in my lifetime
game could be 1313 but noooooo
lmao if we are making damien harris look this good then i dont even want to watch us against henry next week
ravens are a second half team i whisper to myself knowing my happiness for the rest of the night relies on this statement being true
i honestly think duvernay is better than hollywood i dont understand why he gets so little play time
were ok guys only down by 3 i know the end of the half was a bad play but we will be fine come back after half and do the damn thing
remember yannick ngakue or whatever the fuck
welp we are currently getting stomped by the team that barely beat the jets fuck
great now i have to watch this fucking defense again
done for the season were fucked
we must have an illegal formation every fucking game
i havent been this mad and deflated since the last 2017 game
aside from the one play lamar looks good our team is in shambles though
outside of the int lamar is having a good game its the defense losing the fucking game
this man throwing dots in a fucking monsoon no more he cant pass bs
does yannick have a single tackle as a raven
at least peters is fired up wake up the rest of the d mp
give us duvernay this next drive
rollercoaster of emotions rn
that spot was an absolute joke wasnt even close to the first down literally could be the difference in the game
even collinsworth took belichiks dick out of his mouth to call out that cheating ass ref
give our defense credit they gave us a shot
this defense would have been nice to see in the first half
defense has stepped up all year even with injuries lets go offense if we lose im blaming greg roman
skura ruined that entire drive smh
theres no way skura can play center next week if he keeps fucking up snapping
who would have guessed it another penalty to end the game for us no discipline
20 point streak in jeopardy also no turnovers forced also also injuries out of spite i will continue to wear my piss socks
lamar is the only good player on the offense but he gets blamed every game
i feel confident blaming this loss on matt skura injuries and the weather
dolphins fan here all i want to say is destroy these asshats need i say more
i hope you guys win love you guys and stay healthy and get a win
defender ran hollywoods route better than he did
the patriots pass rush is dookie butt
the receivers on this team get absolutely 0 separation for lamar its so frustrating to watch
judon 102 out of 111

kek

edit guess he heard me
why is the mvp trophy so skimp lol it looks more like a player of the month award
this is a classic time killer drive i like it gotta give credit to roman so far lets go boys
we didnt jinx him that time cries in missed tucker kick face lol
would love to see us use duvernay a bit in plays like that
the refs fucking hate this team for some reason
of course our defense decides not to show up
typical pats bullshit pick plays
the nfl really needs to decide if it wants to allow pick plays or not im sick of these fucking grey area plays that only certain teams are allowed to run
did they just tackle andrews into the first down
that was a soft as fuck holding call
wtf was that animation looked like a kids first try in the 90s
defense is getting bent over right now lol
why are we the team that the pats always like to pull these trick plays on
why does it pour when the ravens are driving but not when the patriots are

weathergate
can they suck the patriots off any harder please this is turning into a bukkake fest
that was such a lame duck pass too just begging to be picked off
they have 1 good corner and you throw at him
if hollywood cant separate then he has to at least not get boxed out to the sideline on every damn throw
imagine throwing jump balls to a 58 wr
i really dont want to hear hollywood is enough for this team anymore i dont he is too small to be effective in this league he isnt getting separation from anyone at all so clearly hes not that fast failed experiment move on
lamar needs to learn to just settle sometimes he was going for td when we are already in fg range
game not over yet but if we dont stop the run out the gate it is
i have seen maybe 2 elite plays from hollywood in 15 seasons cardinals game winner and td vs the jets maybe im being too harsh here


dk and aj brown make 2 a game
you really cant make any excuse for that throw hollywood isnt known for making contested catches we have the best kicker in the league and are approaching fg range to tie it and now the patriots get the ball back to start the second half
this is sort of exactly the game i expectedfeared my patriot fan friends and family have been talking about getting killed by the ravens and ive consistently been like you have far more faith in my team than i do
lamars stats before the pick were very good however we still have zero ability to push the ball vertically it disappeared between last season and this
we need to win this without campbell possibly williams next week henry is gonna run for 300 yards
hollywood brown will always be referred to as antonio browns cousin
stop copmplaining youre fair weather fans
are we cursed

seriously were losing multiple players to injuries every game tf is happening
yall im fucking drunk we gotta start tackling people im throwing my name in to be our new linebacker i can get fat ill block
who the fuck thought that play was a good idea why do coordinators try to get cute on 4th down just run a normal play
you have one of the best playmakers in the game naturally under center and you move him why
why the fuck didnt they qb sneak it or something direct snap to ingram who has sat out the past 2 games in the rain what the fuck
i gotta get up at 445 these next couple weeks are gonna be exhausting win or lose
and now boyle

do they keep stats on most injuries in a 2 week span
im getting real tired of the procedural penalties
typical greg roman playcalling over complicated could give adam gase a run for his money
why didnt lamar make him catch that
this is such a miserable game
i think i need to reduce my passion for football this is bad for my mental health lol
ravens offense

if its dobbins its a toss outside

if its gus its up the middle

if its justice hill he goes out on the flat

if its 3rd and short its a lamar run

if its a big pass to a wr they will drop it

if its a big play to a te its negated by illegal formation

skura is going to mess up 4 snaps
for the exception of that pick at the end of half lamar has played well
snead is our best wr lamar and him have great chemistry
finally gave up less than 12 yards on a first down run
we are a second half team now which i would 100 take
due for a turnover no excuse not to get one in this rain
ravens close to within 2317 thanks to the lamar jacksonwillie snead connection

jackson is 4of5 with 2 tds targeting snead tonight

for the season jackson is now 23of29 with 3 tds and an interception when throwing at snead

jamisonhensley
snead has heart
like the call gotta punt it with this much time left coming off a huge stop
bullshit fucking spot
thats legit one of the worst spots ive seen watching football
lol board outplaying queen
yannick with the pressure so much and big stop by board
ngakoue showed up a bit there got some really good pressure

also chris boaaaarddddddd
its lamars time to shine lets fucking go prove the haters wrong
fuck the patriots
how is skura still playing
how did marcus peters not draw a holding
so fucking pissed defense skura boyle hurt rain and yet lamar is gonna get all the blame tomorrow
bench skura thats two straight games of poor snapping and one of them came at the worst time
110 seconds to score a td show them why you are the mvp lamar
backed up to our end zone 1st and 20 no timeouts need a td and we call up a te screen for 5 yards
the timing of the worst part of that storm was incredibly uncalled for
i hate matt skura
all opinions aside about who won or lost this game for us we need to absolutely fucking pick 2 running backs and run them gus averaged 6 yards a carry and got 7 touches this running back by committee shit is not working gus and jk are it feed them the ball
imagine not having lamar jackson on your team lmao
lets go motherfuckers ive spent the entire day putting the final touches on a boring ass 30 pg paper and im so fucking ready for this
how we win this game

no turnovers

thats literally it our defense will handle the rest all we need to do is not turn the ball over and run it lets go
our line looks so much better this week
does anyone else feel like we havent been using ricard well this year at all
that deep sideline throw from lamar to hollywood was actually pretty good

hollywood just got bodied out of bounds there
come back and find this comment when we get a turnover this drive its coming
ingram starting over dobbins is odd
big sack by judon took 3 points away from them
how about the playcalling so far on this drive pretty happy with it to be honest
i really wish duvernay would be given more looks on offense
quick first quarter
is bills son rocking a mullet
super quick 1st quarter
this game goes any quicker i may be in bed by 1015


beep beep motherfuckers
you cant prep for christmas till after thanksgiving
not to jinx it but what a freaking drive thus far
the o looking on pace not trying to force things its looking like last weeks second half looking good so far
roman finally not making his play calls so obvious
lowering the helmet you mean lowering himself to make the hit
its not a real ravens game if the refs arent rawdogging us guys
fuck you hochuli your dad could still beat your ass
cam is such a hero al hes a modern day jesus christ really
that was such shit defense my god
ravens say nt brandon williams is questionable to return with ankle injury


the offense needs to get it keep it together because this defense is basically fucked
lmao thanks for that first down guy
bernard pollard in shambles lol
suuuuper weak call
what the hell was that graphic
starting to feel like that pats hummer right now
our run d needs to get shot into the fucking sun
this is completely horrible to watch
these injuries have fucking gutted us on our 9th string corner we just signed off the street
derrick henry is probably getting very excited for next week watching this game rn
absolutely pathetic showing by this defense
its not just queen thats also on the free safety that stayed in the middle the whole time
tie the game up nah lets go full flacco with it and throw a ridiculous double coverage low percentage throw
marquise just doesnt have the size to win those battles
there is no point to throw to brown unless hes wide open hes not getting contested balls

whats the point of throwing it at a soulja when they cant get any separation in the first place
lol patriot fans talking shit about lamar like he didnt body them last year he killed the boogey men
i hope d makes adjustments like o did last week at half why cant we just have a good pace on both sides
derrick henry is going to do nasty unspeakable things to this defense
injuries slowly turning us into the fucking niners

x200b

pain
harbs talks about us winning the big one this year and we play like this lmao
people saying we shouldnt be complaining because it was just 1 half real quiet right now
queen getting blocked out of the play by a wide receiver classic

edit james white still bad
i worry that gro is going to panic and abandon the successful gameplan now
oh boy here comes the roman air raid offense
same old ravens
anyone notice how the pats continue to do what they do best with there best players notice how they dont put in a 4th string rb at the goaline or try passing 2 of 3 downs on very good dbs in terrible weather conditions anyone else see how they run the damn ball until you stop it maybe roman should take note
people are giving belicheck so much props for exploiting our team fucking joke

our ol is banged up so they blitz heavy

our dl is banged up so they run heavy

does he deserve an award for making obvious scheme decisions
our defense is just gutted with injuries
id be surprised if the pats throw 5 more times today
whywhy do we keep getting cute just have lamar take that snap like a normal fucking offense
so whose ready to watch derrick henry bitch us again next week
we are literally playing with no campbell no williams no fort no jimmy smith a banged up peters and wolfe and now no bonds not even sure we have 11 players to send out there doesnt matter if we explode on offense defense cant make a stop

need a change quick or 65 could be a reality before you know it with the way this run defense is playing
i have a ravens helmet and a jerseyim flying up there and getting in
dudes are dropping left and right fuck this weather man
this game is cursed
so many tickytack bs calls against us
this is the real reason that the offensive coordinator should be in trouble every game these terrible penalties
huh imagine that another illegal formation awesome
how the fuck are we still getting illegal formation penalties every week and its week 10 undisciplined play and shit coaching
asking us to throw to get back into the game with the best weather is tough
so bill is getting fined for all this yelling at the refs with the mask off right right
matt skura has been trash the last 2 games
you cant have snaps like that against a team like the patriots

lmao collinsworth is such a fucking idiot is there a team that its good to have bad snaps against
snead is really our number 1 wr i look at all the wrs other great qbs have and it hurts
snead for team mvp
tucker nothing stops that ball from being dead center
i love watching the absolute raw id of this sub go from abject depression to ejaculation and right back in seconds
lamar has been super impressive with everything considered
ravens arent winning this game without a turnover stack the line and make cam newton beat you in a monsoon
you know its been an awful game of run defense when marcus peters makes the run stop of the game so far
we need our turnover streak turnover right about now
on a positive note duv and proche have done a great job catching kicks in this weather
when zoomed out it looks like the weather is fine then they zoom in and you can really tell how bad the rain is
fuck the haters come on lamar its all on you
absolutely love proches hands
proche is really good at catching punts underrated job that a lot of guys have trouble with
hes been doing that every punt and it was the reason we got the first penalty of the game
please get a saftey
man hollywood has gone to shit since he tweeted that bs get open lil dude
i know id regret it but having antonio brown might have been really sick
didnt robert kraft get caught supporting a sex salon that trafficked young women from asia
admittedly collinsworth calling out their spotting bullshit
fuck off with that spot fuck you refs
alright guys no more game thread for me i cant handle this
wink can make plays with a banged up d and roman still serving us dog shit and we supposed to be ok with that lol
skura is gone should be sent home before the end of the game
fuck skura leave him in boston and make him walk home
thanks skura literally screwed us out of a promising drive

if it rained hard enough could the ball float as it would in a pool allowing for a hail mary
lamar cannot be blamed for this loss dude absolutely balled out but you know the narratives tomorrow in fact espn and fs1 havent been this happy since the clippers lost to the nuggets
lamar deserves so much more than what we are giving him a once in a generation athlete we cant capitalize absolutely embarrassing
roman gotta go one trick pony who will only end up preventing lamar from developing if allowed to
no idea how this front office looked at the wide receiver group this offseason and said yeah looks good lets go with that


fuck the refs
lmfao yeah we suck but im writing that game off what a fucking joke that weather is skura needs to be cut
the ravens are not the jets lmaoo
tree up dog asleep ravens ready to cook its a great night for america
hollywood is 48 of 116 oof
lets go back to the ball to hollywood hollywood has got to show more strength there got pushed about like a child
while i despise our playcalling yall need to chill the fuck out lmao newfans everywhere
injury gods fucking hate raven corners
the fact that mp left under his own power is a good sign
feel a lj scramble coming
lamar is pitching right now
vegas must have known something with the 435 total lol
gus
the bus baby
this has been an awesome drive we need to do this always
i am loving this drive here grinding it out constantly moving forward
im loving the play calling rn keep it up
this is a good drive especially given the conditions
yall i love this drive
wtf happened to gro
lessgo ill stop my snead hate for at least the rest of the half
lets see if peters comes out on d
did somebody say it was time for a fruit punch
imagine working at these ad agencies in the conference room like picture this theres a baseball glove and an empty hoodie going fucking bananas in a shipping facility
fuck that call elliott made a good hit
why do the ravens always get the bs calls against them
where the fuck is our d
defense did not look alive there but starting the drive off with a bs penalty definitely didnt help
you guys need to calm down its one drive and this defense is injured as fuck
earl thomas wife left him this week btw
i want to get excited about hollywood but i havent really seen anything great from this year from him
no holding there lmao
honestly hollywood isnt inspiring a lot of confidence in me lately dont think hes doing bad on the year per se but he seems like a jag plus a tier above jag right now
are we sure minnesota sent us yannick
three guys trying to strip the ball and no one tackling
i think people are missing the part where were missing like 4 playmakers on defense rn
seeing all these blitzers not even acknowledge the ball carrier makes me realize just how spoiled we were with suggs ability to play the run too
man i realllllly want harrison to be a player his stats wont show much but hes a physical presence out there
i miss campbell
we need campbell and williams back for thursday idc what harbs says
that was the most shocking coverage ive ever seen
lol i told yall we about to make ne look good but i got downvoted for saying it most ravens shit ever
in 10 quarters with the ravens now ngakoue has 2 tackles 0 sacks 0 tfl
nice of ne to call that to for harbs
hey hollywood go back to tweeting
shit decision lamar wtf
hes been beating hollywood on every snap
quit tweeting hollywood
a speed guy who cant get separation fuck me
thats the type of throw you give to dez bryant
that was on lamar but jesus fucking christ hollywood can you not get an inch of separation
every week that passes i am less and less impressed by brown i simply do not think as of now he is going to be a good nfl wr
forcing to the 59 wr down deep is not wise
keep the truzz big second half coming up
lamar made a shitty throw hollywood is a tiny ass wr thats never gonna fight for the ball leading to picks
run a yard or five and take the field goal dammit we have tucker

that was just stupid ass decision
that ball shouldnt have been thrown but at this point is hollywood any better then torrey smith ever was
we need a true wr1 so badly im beginning to get frustrated with brown and i cant tell how much of it is him being asked to do too much and how much of it is him just not performing

cant seem to ever get separation
that was bad separation non by hollywood but also a terrible throw by lamar both things can be true
at this point im ready to go full matt millen

just keep drafting wrs in the 1st round until we get our calvin johnson
hollywood isnt bad he just isnt a 1 wr weve known that for a while now
queen made 5 effort to get off that block what the fuck
every single play on that possession looked like the worst defensive play ive ever seen

get ray on the line
this is embarrassing this is a patriots with zero talent on offence and defence destroying us fucking hell
last week defense bailed out offense in key drives its time the offense steps it up and fucking shows up
sure take the ball out of lamars hands
i thought that 4th and 3 call against the steelers was bad take a bow gro
of all fucking plays its a direct snap to ingram
greg roman needs to be fucking gone tomorrow those were the 2 worst consecutive play calls ive ever fucking seen
out of all the plays to call on 4th an 1
judons a liability at this point
how tf do we kill the undefeated tom brady pats but not these guys
cant wait for harbaughs post game presser where he says we just didnt execute im happy with where our guys are at
the only honorable thing to do is have the whole team commit sedoku
humph is grabbing his shoulders thats about right
that soup looks disgusting
his knee is shattered
pretty sure his leg just got broken
and there goes boyle for the season
he died honorably for this pathetic game god bless him
thats an underratedly dirty as fuck play he literally left his feet dove and speared boyles legs

i seriously want them to go after that guy
god boyle is tough
how many times this season has the ravens offense been called for not having enough players on the line of scrimmage it certainly feels like a lot
how big of a take is it that players shouldnt be playing on artificial turf in a monsoon
id go wildcat here
another bad snap for badddd snap by skura
get skura the fuck off the field
is willie snead our 1 wr
were still in this despite everything
colinsworth is sucking the patriots ding dong so hard rn
bruh snead is 1
that tackle on harris to end the quarter looked awkward as hell for harris but ill take the loss of yards
we sneaded that
it is actually stunning how poor the graphics are for snf this is a billiondollar machine and like everyone i know could do better than that in 20 minutes with photoshop
lamar is playing great we cant waste this performance doing dumb shit on defense
peters almost created a to theyre feeling it baby
the athletic just had a great piece about boyle im so sad for him
ill tell you what with all the punt return woes weve had over the years i respect proche coming in as a rookie and handling business
the moodswings i have on this game are insane lets fucking go
this is one of lamars biggest moments in his career hate to say it
watch lamar score here and this game instantly goes from big game to beat the team that almost lost to the jets
come on d save my mental health
hill is a great gunner hes held on ever gunner for a reason
i hope we dont regret this
defense needs a big stop flip the field for the o
absolutely no fucking way this should be even close thats fucking terrible by the refs
that looked pretty clearly short in real time
gerry sandusky going off about the spot
when the commentators are even saying the ref moved the spotwtf
bullshit
this game is hell
good shit defense
nasty series by the d guys in the backfield on almost every play
this is the drive where we have to go all out this is the drive where lamar can prove them all wrong
gus bus please get the w and get the hell out
if skura doesnt get the blame of the week
matt skura has ended his own career today i fear
skura gets the blame deadass
skura screwed that whole drive
really sad loss this shit defense tonight plus the injuries plus whatever the fuck skura is on plus the wack penalties what a shit sunday
20 point streak and turnover streak both bout to end
no hold on that run
blame of the game is easily skura
is peters not being held
peters was held so bad his nipple clamps had to be reset
wouldnt be surprised if harbaugh told clark to do that was pretty smart ngl
if the defense can hold we have a chance with a 120 or so
this is almost the exact same situation as the mile high miracle
would have been nice if our center didnt throw the ball 20 yards into the backfield
chuck claek is so fuckin smart
heres your fucking chance no drops no penalties no dickhead snaps from fat fuck
it isnt often that i point to one play and say it cost us the game but that last bad snap sure seemed to
put the blame of the game thread up
its raining even harder now hilarious

im writing this game off as an outlier theres not going to be rain like this in january
best rushing team in the league and we get stomped in the rain absolutely embarrassing waste of all our time
20 points a game streak snapped
we dont give lamar enough credit
all those lamar designed runs and nothing all passes in a fucking monsoon
skura single handedly murdered our offense
ah so greg roman can use his pieces in effective intuitive ways but only once he has been publicly humiliated for several weeks straight
if we drop this game the steelers have the division
honestly colinsworth just doesnt like the ravens he doesnt shut up about the opposing team when losing has no words when the ravens are winning even when the ravens just lost multiple starters in the game all this prime time analysts can say is how much fight the opposing team has am i crazy or is this anyone elses truth
the game ended a while ago were a wild card team this year its time to get ready for it
we really arent that good just too many mistakes every week
takeaways from this game

we are not super bowl contenders this year injuries and we dont have the offensive depth

lamar is good everyone chill out

matt skura no good

we need to pay up for a top wide receiver we are no good at drafting and developing wrs
was hollywood open nope did he get separation nope was the ball under thrown yup

hard to blame hollywood for that pick
that looks like a perfect form tackle to me refs are shit
can never have our offense and defense show up simultaneously
guys calm down its one drive
hollywood doing a lot of talking and not much producing
those were terrible goal line calls

hollywood had no chance hill had no chance plus these conditions come on man
sighhard not to think thats a forced throw due to brown bitching
only throw to hollywood if he has ran past the defender otherwise its 5050 on whether it is an interception
this whole team need a reset

fire greg roman cut mark ingram let judon walk get a veteran possession wr get marcus peters a therapist or anger management get lamar back with that passing guru and change the locks so greg roman cant get back into the facility
clark jumped offsides to save clock did it on purpose
i would like us to win this football game
stunting begins
it is my hope the ravens score a number of points greater than the number of points they allow the patriots to score enjoy this contest of professional athletes fellows
there will be about 1439 left in the first before i get tired of chris collinsworth ugh
if youre in baltimore charge your phone rn ive heard power is going out in and around the city
that was an accurate deep throw just good ass coverage honestly
hollywoods double move did absolutely nothing to mccourty
i like to see attempts at deep passing plays
hollywood gets bumped off routes so easily
why so many fucking passes to start
were in for a long day against tennessee if we keep this up
im so scared the ravens thinking its gonna be an easy game and making ne look good
justice hill
doing dumb shit that costs us yards
judon
i fucking hate greg roman
i remember being so confident last season every time lamar dropped back it was going to end in a positive play now he drops back and i expect disaster to strike
how tf was that not a false start
that not a false start
the patriots first drive is literally what ours should have been
lmao holy shit pff is terrible
judon haters cant say nothing at this specific moment
does it make anyone else uncomfortable how integrated pff has become with the sunday night football broadcast they treat that shit like its they are a branch of the nfl with official statistics or some shit
why would you fair catch a ball at the 5 that you need to turn around to grab
mandrews
does lamar play out of the pistol or not
duuuvvvvvv
my nerves are calmed
we need to keep this pace its affective dont try nothing crazy lamar
duvvvvvv speed kills
solid drive
that drive was pretty good
yes you need it

that need iv snead

embrace it
sneads has been on his a game for a while lets goooo
i left for two minutes i cant be mad tho leggo boys
probably the best drive ive seen all season
i would love to see lamar break 250 passing tonight even would settle for 200
peters back on the field lets go
this entire sub to greg roman after that drive
that was as clean a hit as you can have
ngakoue needs a sack
were missing calais
fucking terrell
this is how the colts started against us too really attacking the edges we made good adjustments at the half i expect the same today
lamar wanted to sling that so damn bad lol
what did we do to piss off the injury gods
mandrews got launched on that hit damn
they hit him into the 1st lol
thats was 10x worse than our hit
get off hollywoods dick im sick of all these comments in here he was heated and made a dumb tweet get over it jesus
i dont like justice hill getting any offensive snaps
justice hill in the game did yall not just see the gus bus what the fuck is he doing in the game
what a weak ass call
why the fuck is justice hill in the game on 2 and 3rd down in the red zone
imagine if this team had aj brown my goodness
normally im one to not complain about penalties and more often feel its lack of discipline on our own part but that felt like a weak call on fluker
anyone else think that wasnt even a hold
im confused we have ingram back and now we use justice hill we couldnt have used him the last 2 weeks
all good ill take the 3 weve been moving the ball very well defense needs to make a couple stops now we win with 3 more scores if one of those is a td
jc jackson is manhandling hollywood same happened last wk w xavier rhodes
should we have drafted aj brown instead on of hollywood
i hate these sunday night football graphics
high quality graphic there haha our hummer didnt sputter
run defense is absolutely doomed without campbell and williams
theyre getting 57 yards rushing on first down were getting zero pressure
baltimore baltimore we got this
im a pretty skinny dude and its crazy to think that i probably weigh one of calais legs
you guys realize that ne has one of the best offensive lines and missing our interior dl is going to make this a slugfest
ew grandma was probably like i dont want this fucking mutant doll
baker mayfield puts ketchup on his tacos
i really would like to not have to stay awake for this entire game so if we could start playing defense now thatd be great
we have to stop the run this is painful
69 seconds till halftime
could go for a nice tall fruit punch right about now before half
we need brandon williams back in the second half
how did you let them score on the most common trick play ffs
ravens a falling for trick plays name a more iconic duo
queen thats all on you there buddy
the trickery shit always catches us snoozing
and ne gets the ball back after halftime
fuck offense is going to have to carry this game
yes he missed it

come on one minute to at least tie it up
aight lets go with this 2 minute drill let hollywood put his money where is mouth is
now i gotta endure the cringey tweets saying thatll be the best pass you see tonight
lets utilize our sophisticated passing concepts to help lamar get a quick td oh wait gro doesnt have those
incoming pats trolls

grow up
campbell and williams not playing

why cant we stop the run
why is our fastest receiver always seeming to be running a 5 yard route
stop throwing jump balls to hollywood holy fuck
cant throw to hollywood and cant underthrow him like that hes not fast enough to win and hes not big enough to contest the catch
and all of this is brought on though hollywoods comments force feeding and that happens
its crazy that tyreek hill is always open and hollywood can never get separation despite being the fastest on the field
stop riding hollywood we need real receivers
hollywood crying for the ball on twitter but hasnt gotten open all season
bruh ik lamar is good mvp and has potential to be so much morebut cant defend everything he does
i hate how they only throw it to hollywood on this type of throwssituations whenever them to get him involved they only do it on some dumb shit like double coverage
hollywood is not even a number two receiver hes a liability hes too fucking weak and small you cant throw anticipatory pass to him because if any cornerback is even close to him then they can effortlessly manhandle him and dictate his direction
imagine having hopkins
alright so really what is hollywoods purpose

hes obviously not equipped to be a 5050 jump ball guy which is fine but he hasnt gotten separation at all and has zero rac production because he drops the second anyone gets near him

so really hes just a deep ball threat who unfortunately hasnt shown the ability to be a threat downfield at all this season and has bitched and moaned about not getting more usage
at least torrey smith was big bigger than 59 and would jump for it
please wake the fuck up defense in the 2nd half get the ball back make this shit right
if bw is out we are in trouble with stopping ne run in 2nd half
man we are missing campbell so bad
derrick henry is gonna kill us next week
jesus ravens shouldnt be worried about covid theres a fucking injury bug ravaging our roster
cam goes empty and they didnt expect him to run what is going on rn man
fuck it just put 6 dl out there dont care who it is cant be worse than this
anyone else embarrassed right now
everyone has bad games it happens but this is really not a game we can afford to lose
williams is out for the game fuck
whatever drugs ben takes to stay healthy give that shit to calais and bwill
people wigging about roman lmao roman dont play defense guys
were fucked without campbell and williams
just a reminder coming into tonight we were 1 in rush defense dvoa williams and campbell matter a lot
3rd rounder for yannick and he hasnt done shit
lamar this is the time to show what you can do our defense is playing like trash and injured to hell

come back control this game
that rb toss from the shotgun must be one of the worst plays ever
this may be the worst coached year of harbaughs career
the ravens starting oline consists of orlando brown jr and 4 guys who would be back ups on every other team
thats game fuck this
ok back to needing to fire greg roman
we put in ingram to receive a shotgun snap on 4th down when its raining this bad
when it rains it pours
that mightve been the worst play call i ever seen
lol greg roman needs to go wtf is that play call
wtf play call was that groman
retarded 4th down play call again fire roman holy shit

ppl need to seriously spam all social media and radio to get this fucking dunce out of here
wait wait wait lamar isnt back there to receive the snap thats the call against palpatine over there
im past fire greg roman
fucking called it they were gonna fuck up that 4th down what a fucking embarrassment against the dogshit pats too
fire greg roman the man is an idiot
popular opinion fire greg roman or at least take away his playcalling duties jesus
if greg roman has a job tomorrow morning then harbaugh is a fucking pussy
this team will probably go 106115 then lose our first playoff game to the chiefs or some shit
direct snap to rb in rain on 4th n 1ok
roman needs to go

shouldve done it a while ago tbh
lets get firegregroman trending on twitter please
theres your dumbass matt judon penalty of the game
judons weekly foul
thats simply not a penalty
that was a bad call not judons fault dude is 100lbs
queen getting smoked or just me
pernell matthew judon mcphee
fs in the chat for all of the european fans who have stayed up til 315am on a monday morning to watch this game
fuck now marlon is hurt
well lamar heres your chance to pull off a big time comeback and shut everyone up
at least the major damage was averted down by 2 scores it can be done show them whats up lamar prove yourself
queen is having another rough game gave up that td he could have defended if he wouldve turned around and every tackle it looks like hes getting drove forward like 3 yards he needs to put on some weight
fuck if the pats are asking for medical staff then its serious
give us a fucking break
omg i bet he broke his fuckin leg or something they immediately said oh shit on the field god damn it i feel so bad for boyle oh man
scooby doo meme where he unmasked the 2020 ravens and its just the 2015 ravens

fuckin injuries man
dont rewind to watch that just dont
knee diving bullshit im sure that is what bb teaches 100
dont worry we can have hurst step in oh wait
yall cant be blaming lamar for boyle
i never want to see that injury again
we must lead the league in illegal formation penalties
team gonna be practicing on the hospital beds
this is just a sad game i can barely even watch
jesus christ pats need to calm the fuck down
sit ingram start gus
you all want to know why lamar looks like he doesnt give a shit anymore just look at this team he literally cant do anything and he is going to take all the flack for it because his team is shit you cant polish a turd and call it chocolate
gus has been our most reliable offensive player for quite a while now it seems lol
wow skura is a shitty snapper
were just need two tds

lets get it
gus edwards is the only player on this offense that is consistently reliable
snead wr 1
fuck im wetter than the football that was an amazing drive
d gotta make a play now though
lamar could be so good with a creative oc like the chefs have they even got great developed role players beavsue the oc knows how to use everyone
the good news is we scored

the bad news is that our defense is getting back on the field
there you go juciemannnn
i enjoyed peters saying screw this i enjoyed it a lot
mp juiceman making the plays
two stops man cmon give lamar a chance
just one stop is all we need defense
underrated play by yannick there that wont be on the stay sheet eating up that blocker
yannick has a nice play on that 2nd down to slow blockers and let judon clean up
finally the defense is awake
lets go theres the ravens d
boston is such an oddly nice looking city so many historic buildings looking like theyre straight out of 1776 surrounded by modern
im honestly just confused as to why were so wildly inconsistent
whos fatter justin ellis or big ben
holy fuck its 10pm i am not ready for this week i procrastinated a lot on friday
shut up collinsworth
i honestly wonder if lamar is not running as much because he is tired of the running qb talk he seems like it
5 yard curl on 3rd and 12
holding on the receiving team the penalty moves the ball back 3 inches first down
nice job drawing a holding justice
and thats why you punt good call
lol lamar wanted to stay on i love him
all right now the defense needs to show itself again we know theyre going to run because theyre pin deep so stop the run and force them to punt from their end zone and well get great field position
im fine with us not going for it there too much risk and too little reward with too much time left

plus we backed their ass up
just wanna say no matter what i love you guys
hollywood was too busy posting himself squatting on ig to actually improve his game
patrick queen has looked awful tonight
bullshit spot
awful fucking spot
chris you just described cheating bud welcome to new england
that spot was fucking terrible
bro these refs are blind
what is that bullshit spot
thats the bullshitest spot ive ever seen
chris board
wow we were all over that play
time for lamar to make up for that bonehead int
in the pocket

no close receiver

under pressure

why no grounding
chuck is calling out their plays
that shot of lamar was pure gold
board man gets paid babayyy
offense step the fuck up
we better be 26 on games trailing at half this shit has got to stop
cmon lamar stunt on these hoes
lamar gonna end this
target mandrews and snead and feed jk and gus run it right over them
good tackle by board but it really was yannicks rush that made that play
you guys are getting fucked by the refs
skura just lost us this game
skura hiked this game right out the fucking window
that hit on lamar gets called 99 times out of 10
holy shit that throw was bad bad like there was 3 pats that were ready to pick that
do yall see how quick they are blowing plays dead for them but for us its yeah lets let every defender on the team get a lick on our guy
this fucking oline man i want to go back and find the cunt who downvoted me and said i was dumb for being worried about them
wed be in a much better spot if we got that fg earlier rather then the lamar int
steelers 90 and we just got embarrassed by a shit team lord
lamar jackson guys we can actually win this game



skura lemme introduce myself
what about the hold what the hell
how the fuck was that not holding on peters
actually not a bad idea to go offsides
chuck did that on purpose its actually a smart play
honestly not a bad penalty
honestly havent been so emotionally deflated by injuries since that horrific 2015 season
watch lamar come back from this
please one series of good snaps skura
this team was great to start the season but you cant be a great team when half your team is on ir even if we win this game its gonna be a tough road the rest of the season well make the wildcard game but its gonna have to be lamar of 2 years ago when its just him using his legs to win games
its a fucking mess out there

the weather is too
mother nature decided to get worst and be like naaah famm go home
the weather is a pats fan
beyond pathetic fucking pathetic
last year lamar showed up to this game apparently no one else did
that is one of the worst drives ive ever fucking seen
the entire interior oline is expendable imo really need replacements there
we have 1 tight endlast year we had 3
oh hey pats trolls

go fuck yourselves

signed
ravens fans
lamar slander is outrageous hes literally the only one who showed up today blame the rush d gash after gash in the run game
you know people want to try to shit on lamar being more of an rb but if it works it works
just 6 days ago flacco and the jets put up 20 in the first half against the pats
why throw to your souljas when they fail to get any separation
are we allowed to complain yet just checking
the injuries are too overwhelming this year
man who would have thought we would be this crappy this season so weird
it aint lamar guys
fuck yeahhhh
mike trico picked the patriots to win i want whatever hes on right now lmao
it just sunk in that the ravens are about to play lets fucking go
fuck the pats good luck guys i gotta go to bed
it takes 10 years to get open lmao
aight that was a weak drive but that last throw wasnt terrible
oline looks like they are holding up pretty good thus far
toyota venza

for when youve given up on life
sooooo the pats are doing what we should be doing

right good okay
malik didnt get the tackle but made that play
hitting cam newton looks fucking painful
no xbox for you deshonn
lmfao how do you miss that obvious false start
i miss campbell
belichick is going to capitalize on the calais hole
judon and queen grades are a yikes
judon saw that stat and took it personally
walk it off juicemanwalk it off
this sub simultaneously wants us to run the ball pass it lol
run the ball with jk or gus
progressive commericals are so fucking bad
god i love jk he just doesnt stop running
dobbins just doesnt go down on first contact
get off him you fat fuck guy
a slant it worked lets never run it again
if theres one thing i like about snead its he runs with great ball security
is bills son rocking a mullet
i grab my knees everytime lamar runs
seems like duvernay is in over boykin
draw up more of those plays for duv plz roman
this a nice matriculate the ball down the field kind of drive lets hope they can cash it in for 6
someone lit a fire under romans ass i see
let ingram punch this baby in a welcome back td if you will
svu still going strong lol
long drive to give juiceman some time to rest up
i feel like lamar has finally stopped trying to prove he can throw the ball and is actually taking what the defense gives him
nice call lady ref
casual 94 yard drive right there
sneeeeeeeeeeead
snead deserves more recognition man
god this playcalling has me at fullmast
gro is watching chiefs games

great playcall
last night i rewatched nick boyles first career td catch which was last year vs pats
that drive was 8 min 14 plays 90yds

that drive ending in snead td 8 min 13 plays 90 yards

we are looking good
the fact that a little toss pass like that counts as a passing touchdown will never not confuse me
snead bb
touchdown ravens
snead is my fav receiver
jt almost never misses stfu man lol i remember they jinxed him and it was against the pats
every single time tucker kicks a fg all i can think of is the still fuckin got it video lmao
if this game was in baltimore wed hear the bullshit chants after that penalty
deshon either had to do that or not tackle him at that angle fucking nonsense
at least we can move the ball down the field without ref help
elliott couldve just got another flag this guy is is undisciplined
in other news

the weather outside is weather
our defense isnt inspiring much joy at the moment we really fucking miss campbell
dude quit biting on that play fake
as long as greg roman keeps thinking its 2019 well be fine
when i was a kid i thought they had someone run on the field in between plays and repaint the yellow line i was not a smart kid
ingram is still a bull but he looks fuckin slow lol
how many times has collinsworth said diabetes
this bus has no brakes
busssss
lamar and hollywood have no chemistry anymore
we needed dez on that end zone pass
goat for 3 better then nothing
week hold jesus
terrible for justice hill to be in on those two plays edwards or dobbins all day
glad bill and harbaugh agreed to get everyone to bed on time tonight
bruh what is that animation
dude we want some cool animation for snf

okay boss but what animation

i dont know youre the creative genius do something

umm like lamar and cam battling ninja style

nah thats too lame how about two suvs going into the forest

umm okay boss 2 suvs then
can we please clog up the middle for once today
we have an offensive linemen on defense 71
bout time we stopped one jc really missing campbell and willams right now on the ground
every fucking run is getting at least 23 yards after contact
yooo wtf if somebody stole the toy dump truck i have tied to the front of my international id be pissedddd
were so fucking depleted
lol this is so pathetic
remembers that we have to face derrick henry next week
we need to get into the fucking backfield
defense really getting manhandled
im having nam flashbacks
are you fucking serious
at least they missed thank god
shit defense
how does belichick save all these trick plays against us
at least its still a 3 pt game
huge miss on extra point tho
said it last week and ill say it again we struggle with misdirection
queen bit so fucking hard
its annoying that when one side of the ball gets hot the other gets cold
patriots really saved us with that timeout
as of now i just dont see hollywood as a 1 wr
oh good another commercial
dont force it to hollywood
hollywood is a negative
wtf was that throw
souljas
bro you have got to be fucking kidding me
you gotta be shitting me just fucking throw it away lamar what the fuck
how is hollywood always so out of position on his routes
can brown beat anyone i mean seriously he can never get separation
lamar trying to force the ball to hollywood who cant get open
completely underthrown too lamar not doing himself any favors on national tv
remember when we were down 3 at half last week
maybe hollywood should try getting some actual separation before going on twitter
we need a big jump ball wr
why the fuck did he try that holy shit
hollywood isnt a 1 wr for a reason why would we expect him to make that catch overall bad read and throw
what week will greg roman learn that its a bad idea to have guys 3 inches shorter than their coverage run a go route on the outside
it was so dumb to attempt that because we would have had to try for the fg anyway if he had caught it we should have just checked it down for like 510 yards
i have not felt this thoroughly annoyed since 201617 lmao

we dont have a lot of key players but these excruciating stupid errors will not work against any team of substance
lamar had a good first half other than the last throw unfortunately its mistakes like those that always kill us
defense the reason we are losing not that lamar throw
that was a predetermined throw guessing lamar figured theyd be overplaying for the short throw to make the fg easier

god that was an absolutely indefensible decision our shortest wr their best db tonight double coverage with a tying fg to protect i love lamar but fuck that decision it was garbage and so was the throw which was on the inside
i asked this last week and got downvoted but can someone explain why we picked hollywood over metcalf i know there were route concerns about metcalf but routes are fixable being 58 isnt
this is the worst baseball game ive ever seen
the only way a throw like that makes any sense if you are throwing to a hopkins level of receiver otherwise its just a poor decision if you are throwing to someone like hollywood
d hop is so good man
and defense comes out looking the same lol
was calais cambell literally our whole run defense
wtf did they go over at halftime
jfc the defense cant stop a nosebleed today
meanwhile the jets were dominating
zero fucking discipline
marcus peters needs a therapist
defense injuries really starting to show
its so pathetic just stay down and take a nap everybody
they scored in under 2 minutes nice job d
this is the season i was expecting last year what the fuck is happening
funny how we beat the pats when they were undefeated and now we cant do anything against a team that had to beat the jets off of a walk off
we havent hit a 40 yard pass since week 1 thats bad for instance murray has only 2 games where he hasnt had one
time to completely abandon the run throw into double and triple coverage and then make a last minute lame duck comeback attempt only to be picked off late
one of the best
if our offense doesnt score here it could be game over honestly our defense isnt stopping them
honestly shouldve been a 3410 win for us and new england already has 20 points halfway through the game run defense continues to look terrible
just let gus fucking run on all the plays
fluker replaced with a 2nd year udfa center yikes
fluker got benched mekari to rt and powers in at rg now

good decision
fuck skura
matt skura sucks so fucking bad
can morgan cox play centre everything out of shotgun
play had no chance anyway they knew it was coming
the connection to your opponent has been lost
thats our 4th and 1 call
greg roman got to go
just not meant to be tonight yall
get greg roman the fuck off this team what the fuck is that the takes were over reactive but enough is enough
why call that with conditions like they are
hahahaha fuck me
what the fuck is this game is this even the same team they showed up with the wish version of the team
please swap skura and mekari at least mekari can fucking snap the ball correctly
idk who to blame more roman or skura but im sick of both of their shit
looking a little underprepared tonight on both sides of the ball a little distracted
lamar is the best athlete on the field and he didnt touch the ball on 4th down

why
3 and 3 qb sweep
4 and 1 wildcat formation

i honestly dont understand this
bro can chris collinsworth just not suck off the patriots
cant wait to see judon get 20 mil a year from the jets
complete waste of a good lamar game minus one pass such a shame
it hurts to watch our ravens play like this i love them so much but they hurt me sometimes
how are these pick plays legal theyre not even selling the routes
16 straight unanswered 16 absolutely unacceptable
at least they didnt score 7

if we get a td this could get interesting
humphrey holding his shoulder after that play plz dont be hurt
whats up with all the pats fans dming me like i never get one now yall too scared to post in the thread
why is harbaugh a notorious pussy when it comes to making tough decisions regarding staffcoaches
marlon humphrey was grabbing at his left arm at the end of that play in things that the ravens can ill afford
nice fucking knee diving garbage
were the fucking niners now its official
hayden come back
injuries is the blame of the year just keep the boys safe
all my friends are dead ravens edition
marlon humphrey grabbed his left shoulderarm after that play the ravens cant afford another injury there aaronkazreports
x200b

prayers for nick boyle
just bench lamar for the rest of the season so he doesnt get killed at the rate were going
our entire team is fucking injured absolutely insane

also regardless of that i hope nick boyle is ok that looked really awful
fuck this cut our losses and forfeit the game right now this isnt worth it
nick boyle down on the ground and not getting up

looks like he twisted or broke his kneeleg
and nick boyle is done for the year fuck this game and the rain to hell
boyle probably just broke his leg or tore a major ligament in his knee at the very least fuck
damn man hope boyle is alright that sounded bad
oh my fucking god why would you show that again
i like how slightly lowering your head incurs a foul but spearing someones knee doesnt
did god create us just to see us suffer
every time i see a flag i immediately know its on us
13 points isnt a big deficit to make up with so much time left but there isnt much going their way to suggest its going to work out
are you fucking kidding me that penalty is total shit
is that like the 4th game in a row with an illegal formation penalty what the fuck are they doing at practice
can we somehow clone mark andrews i dont know 56 copies for starters
give gus the ball its raining and he can gash them
best rushing offense in the nfl
pouring rain
passing the ball every play
we didnt run a dumbass wildcat play and we gained yards on 4th down weird
damn it is raining and theres a worse line of storms on the way
this game is such an indictment of greg roman on his third team as oc fucking get rid of him
i dont give a shit about the paper cut on skuras hand snap the fucking ball correctly its your job
love u lamar
force a fumble or get a pick on this drive please defense
lamar isnt afraid of the rain this man was born and raised in soflo
thank god lamar is still doing well tn
were due to force a turnover
lets have morgan cox put on 100lbs and make him our center he seems to be the only ever me who can snap the ball consistently
were gonna sign tes or bring em up from the practice squad
defense stand up
snead been showing up dare i say im starting to like him
dfence
tone setting tackle by juiceman
ok peters
back 2 back comeback weeks by lamar pls god
juiceman
all day peters
peters what a fucking play lets go
best quarter of the year lets fuckin go
big play there from mp juice
a 3andout here would be so fucking good
holy shit we stopped them
defense looks more fired up get it for boyle
idc what anybody says lamar is a fucking legend best qb the ravens have had in quite a long time
thank you defense
lamaroffense as a whole got the defense hype
lets go win it lamar
whoever that was actually got me excited for a second making me think he blocked the punt
three and out
run the ball gregory
despite everything that has happened and how shit we played at times im really paying attention to how we close this game out
staaahhhp giving ingram the ball
im sorry but ingrams time is up
i love ingram but him being back honestly hurts the team cause of how much they want to give it to him over gus
take the yards lamar fuck
what in the hell did they do to lamar that is making him not run there its a scary ass thought that he is throwing it there
not a good drive but good job from special teams they are pinned deep
i dont have any idea why they called a play where the wr gets the ball 8 yards from the marker
lamar i get you want to prove to people you can throw the ball but just take the yards
anyone find it weird no wr is wearing gloves
a turnover here would be huge
i really wish lamar would just be lamar and do lamar type shit when he sees space fuck the media and take off with the ball
were due a turnover defense lets go keep the streak alive
damn that covid ballerina commercial was rough
no way thats the proper spot
generous spot like wtf
theres no way he got that
bullshit spot
bullshit bullshit bullshit
no way terrible fucking spot
refs just spotting to give them the first
home cooking spot right there
insane how the first quarter felt like 5minutes and since then has felt like a game and a half
that was a terrible spotbut allowing a nobody rb to get 11 yards on second down from their own 2 is awful
ngl our run d has looked great last few drives
what the hell was judon doing
queen has been way worse this game than in the kc game
now i can stop bitching for a second
that was a coaching adjustment
good pressure yannick and good stop board
do not give the ball to ingram or hill
so frustrating lamar plays well d has issues yes i know injuries or its the opposite if we somehow put it together we still have a good season ahead
ok given the injuries great series by the defense now o has to do their job
alright lamar time to silence the ignorant haters
despite everything despite all of our problems of injuries the weather the road trip the two score deficit we still can win this jesus this team really toughened up and im happy to say that
please score please
we control the clock now a long drive is perfectly fine
lets go win a fucking game fuck joe flacco
get matt skura out of there
i s2g if we lose this game because of a bad snap
fuck skura
that was a real drive killer man fuck me
how the fuck is that not a penalty
im not putting that on lamar skura fucked up
skura blows the entire drive
one more time d one more time
lamar throws it directly into 3 dbs
bro we gonna lose this game cause of skura
blame of the game skura
3rd and 15 and andrews is sent on a 2 yard out this is painful
we literally threw the game away 2nd and like 5 or something versus 2nd and 26 fucking hell
i mean yeah skura fucked us there but mandrews had it in the numbers and dropped it
gus edwards get 7 yds on 1st down then we go empty skura is shitting himself
skura fucked up but that ball was wet as shit

also lamar is forcing this fucking ball wayyyy too much to brown and it clearly shows like seriously dude got picked off and almost got picked off again trying to get him the ball
jk dobbins snead and gus edwards may be the only people i trust on the entire offense
at this point im just hoping our defense scores a touchdown lol
can we out mekari back at center he played really well last year
if we pull this out i still want a blame of the game thread for skura
queens worst game by far
yeah gonna leave this game 63
theres a flag on that are you kidding me
hollywood stats 2 catches 14 yards
peters was right he was held
typical offense shitting the bed when the defense steps up
how much you think cams tooth is worth
not over yet
i know im like 5 mins early but blame of the game i wanna say skura so bad but it has to be run d
imagine having the wr core that we have and heavily relying on snead the entire game
this feels like the steelers game again
theyre playing in a fucking typhoon
just get off the field with no injuries and move on end this misery
i know the odds are against us and the weather was terrible but they look like they just gave up no sense of urgency that was tough to watch
i cant even blame jk for dropping that shit the rain is actually fucking ridiculous
i have never seen rain that hard during a game before it was approaching caddyshack level of absurdity
whatever fuck the ass weather fuck the refs and fuck the patriots
please fire fucking roman and matt sukra tonight
my gosh what an embarrassment and couple that with the loss of boyle todays game was a disaster
man we really lost thati hate the negativity in this sub but i cant blame em either we may be 63 but we look absolutely like trash
man what a shit feeling they exploited our weakness where we were injured and so much momentum was lost by one or two mistakes on drives towards the end it was kind of pathetic on o but that was without another starter in boyle and in a hurricane bad snaps hopefully will be fixed after skurras finger heals stopped 2 drives outright
yes lets do a jump ball to the 5 foot fucking 9 receiver when we could have dez bryant
first half ravens

second half ravens
nothing went right on that play

the decision to throw it was bad the throw in itself was bad hollywoods route was bad

the play was 2nd down and 4 against pretty soft coverage they were 10 yards away from fg range the ravens had a timeout in the bag get underneath yardage and tie it up
i dont care whos injured you let some scrub ass rb go for 100 in two quarters you suck
lamar jackson should have made that tackle smh
cris collinsworth still sucking off the patriots even without tom brady
shut up marqise
72 is a huge difference from 63
henry gonna go for 250 on us
does anyone else worry that last year was the year and we fumbled it away


edit not literally fumbled it away
patriots may have lost brady but they didnt lose them zebras
receivers getting absolutely 0 separation
some of yall are the biggest reactionary fans one drive and you think we were down 2 scores im watching this one on my own tonight have fun and stay safe everyone
hollywood is a 2 receiver that has height issues he can still be really good but you have to use him well this is the worst team for that this team has a fundamental lack of understanding when it comes to the receiver position and how to use players
just a reminder that this is the same dog shit team that almost lost to the jets last week making us look like god damn fools
judon is an idiot get this bum off the team
never should have traded hurst and you cannot convince me otherwise
i was gonna complain that someone in here told me to fuck off for saying either way its just a football game but then his comment history claims hes still in no nut november so that makes more sense some of yall need to chill man
i refuse to believe refs arent bias against us all year you just cant convince me theyre being fair towards us theres no way
watch this is where roman tries to get cute and call some stupid plays
well we had a shot fucking skura man what the fuck
i stg if we lose cuz of fucking skura
madden curse
lamar showed up if anyone denies this they are idiots
said it earlier and ill say it again greg roman needs to go

also if any of you blames this loss on lamar youre not paying attention to what happened tonight our defense got punched in the mouth and didnt respond until it was too late outside of the interception lamar played a good game and was the only reason we were in it to begin with

onto tennessee
fuck all yall saying dont worry im so fucking tired of being called a bandwagon when clearly we are sucking ass
we need a confidence win tonight boys
lets get my birthday off to a good start with a w
god i hate chris collinsworth
stunt on these hoes
justice hill why
stupid justice
i dont mind taking the shot there at least not the best first drive but theres life
he was turned around so he didnt see the fair catch im just curious how that wasnt a hold
maybe he would have seen the fair catch if he wasnt being held all the way down the field
so is hollywood just not that fast in game speed for a guy whos speed is supposed to be on par with tyreke hill only one of them is consistently running past dudes
how do they miss the holding on that kick he was literally running backwards because of it
are you dudes gonna get on hollywoods dick every time he doesnt catch a pass thrown to him or hes our guy you fuckin weirdos
that first drive is the story of roman a lob on 3rd down wut and mark ingram shouldnt be starting we played better without him
harrison fucking tossed his guy back wow
oh goody the cant defend the run problem from last year has made a return
mr taco bell with the sack
nobody ranks matt judon 102 out of 111 nobody
wow judon had a nice sack finally
you smell like fish i was talking to jamie did anyone else catch that
bless the knees
i hate when we get the ball first
lets go lj
and now im dizzy fuck that camera
mandrews sighting
nbc your camera work buddy
lj 3
lets go snead
idk the offense just looks nervous to me like theyre really afraid to screw up and have lost confidence in their ability to drive the field everyone but the runningbacks
theyre playing the sex pistols pleasantly surprised
liking what im seeing from lamar
id really like to see duvernay get more reps potentially explosive slot guy
thats how you scheme for a speedy wr
cant say i wouldve guessed a scoreless first quarter
gus bus 1st down
edwards stopped at the los but still got through damn
great drive now capitalise on it with a td
love this drive lets finish it off
lj legggooooo
big trussssss
weather is going to make this game have a lot of running
94 yards sheesh
caw caw lets go bitches
okay was that a pass i need to know for fantasy lol
i missed the play because nbc in new york switched to an emergency weather report what happened
you just got sneaded
that was such a nostalgic drive
need for snead
i love the plays on that drive
lmao good on al for recognizing the jinx
didnt realize that was a pass until i opened the ravens app and saw the box score not a bad passing td lol
what happened i was in the bathroom
damn lj and cam in some good company with that stat

except oj fuck oj
juiceman back out there
soft ass league
refball again laughable call as usual
by the book that was a good call but i think it was kind of weak
looks like were playing the refs again
that was a great tackle
please not another 100 yards in penalties game
of course theyre slobbering over cam now
so when calais coming back
straight ass defense that drive
shit defense on that entire drive
defense needs to get it together
no calais and bwill fuck
gotta give em props for that confusion they caused there
bonds is a dog shit player is revis still able to run
they really upped collinsworths adderall dosage
usually the offense gets shit on in this sub today its the defense lol feels weird
lets run it again
no campbell fort and smith tonight really sucks
i like to imagine lamar says gotta blast like jimmy neutron before he scrambles like that
i think its safe to say that this game is extremely important for ingram he needs to ball out to keep his spot with gus and dobbins going ape the last few weeks
andrews catches a 5 yard pass in the air and gets pushed into a first down
thanks

mandrews
i love ingram but seeing dobbins get his carries taken away sucks

its about time the ravens got one
im surprised pat just shook that off he got rocked
hollywood didnt even try to jump for that just asked for a flag
what is he putting his hand up for lol that was just good coverage bro
we got a call and greg is calling good plays

what is happening
weak holding call smh
the fix is in
fuck it lets make this the shortest game in nfl history
i love justice but im surprised hes active and playing offense with ingram back 4 hbs plus ricard active
imagine having dez bryant for goal line plays
anybody else like golden monkey mmm 95
we need b will so bad god what a blow to have both him and calais out
what the hell is this tackling
our run defense is worrisome
not having campbell and williams is really showing now
harrison the only dude working on defense or what
justin ellis looks like absolute shit
paging the fruit punch
rather have ward in than ellis
defense is always trying to cause a turnover and its causing some whiffs on tackles
literally are missing our best interior lineman on both sides its no wonder they are running at will
concerning how williams comes out of games when we need him most
haha baker cant open the gate average joe haha
down calais and williams and lj is gonna suck today defense didnt turn back into a pumpkin overnight just a smart coordinator using his team specifically built to run the ball smash mouth style and taking periodic shots at abusing our rookie lbs queen is gonna stuff a few of those runs eventually
how many defensive starters we missing like 5 rn
thats not a first the ball was behind the line the whole way
their left tackle moved early again
jfc this is bad
this is certainly annoying as fuck
we havent stopped a drive on defense this entire half
getting pushed around this is not ravens football
what the hell is the defense doing
brandon williams never really appreciated until hes not there
judon made it through a quarter without getting any flags
its so fucking obvious what the new england play is and they still just keep getting gashed over and over and over
jesus theyre running circles around us
cant wait to see this defense against derrick henry next week going to get a swift punch in the mouth
can someone speculate on campbells injury do we think its possible for him to return next week or not likely
that looked like a pretty cozy little island to live on in the allstate commercial
always get fucked by the trick plays

somethings never change
queeeeeeen noooooooo
god dammit

whyd they just give up covering him dammit queen wtf
queen what the fuck man
queen is a liability right now
of course the defense decides to be shit when the offense starts improving
why do they always pull this shit against us like non stop bullshit
dj khalid handling the commercial duties tonight

another one
x200b

geeez louise why so many commercials

x200b

lets just get the first half over with
using a soldier who is playing like a reserve make the play or shut your mouth hollywood
not even up for debate we need ol wr and dl badly
why is there so much football interrupting my commercial marathon
i never understand why they nfl takes a 2 minute commercial break in the final 2 minutes of the half for a 30 second timeout
fucking horrible decision cant blame that on greg roman
what a dumb throw
fucking hell lamar what was that
are you kidding me lamar
hollywood soft af

jc jackson is also great
why would you throw a jump ball to someone whos 4 feet tall
wtf field goal gives us a tied game and we do that fuck off
i think lamar really wants to prove he can comeback after down at halftime two weeks in a row
why fucking throw there just run the ball get tucker a few more yards and let him kick it jesus fucking christ
why bruh just pick up 5 and take a field goal
just why bad throw and hollywood cant physically compete on jump balls
that was the same play that almost got picked before

bad idea to throw

bad play call

terrible route because hollywood is running so close to the line that there no room to throw the ball
i never ever ever again want to hearbrown bitch about not getting the ball get the fuck open and stop bitching
thought he was throwing to boldin
were in field goal range down by 3 and dont get the ball at half why dont we go ahead a throw a bomb to our undersized wide receiver who has proven to not be able to separate when hes completely covered i think thats probably the smartest play here
lol first justice hill playing entire first and goal series into throwing that pass to their only good corner
tbh our offence actually has been playing well but our defence cant seem to stop a nosebleed today
at this point if youre going to take a deep shot throw it to duv he is at least physical
annoying that lamar escapes pressure so often with few receivers open separation really sucks with our wr group
we are down by 3 going into the half again interesting
i really fuckin wish we had a 1
alright defense half time adjustments better be clutch

i want a turnover
derrick henry about to go for the rushing record next week
run defense
patrick queen is getting whored every play of this game im going to say again this is the worst game ive ever seen a raven mlb have
fuck this bullshit
patriots are playing with so much energy and we just look flat
patriots are straight dicking us and this team and coaching staff deserves it
holy shit were making pats look like sb contenders right now
oh great and two fucking players injured fuck this
just let him walk in
disgraceful
losses are a team effort too
i guess the solution to run on us is hope williams and campbell get hurt
if we can somehow pull out a win without brandon williams and calais that would be huge so far not feeling confident
there is no passion there is no aggression no motivation
if the game continues like this we deserve the l
just a reminder that the only stop we got on defense was because of a judon sack should have been a sign
henry is about to have 200 yards again isnt he
playing past 8pm is little bit past this defense bedtime sorry guys
harbaugh wtf is going on time to stop giving coaches excuses now
dont praise roman nbc

were on the edge of this game getting out of hand 1 good drive and a stop are all we need to be back in it
fluker was bad but weve got a center at tackle
what are these play calls
udfa mekari went from center guard to tackle
a 5 wide qb run

who fucking knew
wowwhat are we going to blame that bad snap on

x200b

get it together ravens
stop with that cute bullshit yall look stupid
greg needs to be fired
classic ravens shit the bed moment
keep it fucking simple holy shit
fire greg roman
skura is garbage
thats it goodnight yall
harbaugh needs to explain that one i know he doesnt call the plays on offense but he has a say and that was horrible wildcat on 4th down in your own territory
how many running plays before the pats make it 2710 3
that was fucking stupid lets remove our superstar qb from the equation on 4th down with the game basically on the line

so fucking stupid
if we all fix our mind in gr getting fired at once it may happen
its getting tougher and tougher to argue that were a top 5 team in the nfl
bruh they might have to draft me to the ravens if theres more injuries theres not gonna be anyone left at this rate
4th and 1

greg roman lets throw mark ingram in the wildcat it worked that one time
1 fucking yard cant sneak the ball what the fuck
fuck greg roman
this offense is a joke defense is allowed to have a bad game after carrying the team for 6 weeks
the one year we should actually handle the patriots and we do this
roman has possibly the fastest player on the field in lamar and he gets cute by putting mark ingram back there who is just back from injury to catch a soaking wet foot ball snapped from skura who has big toes for fingers

great call
fucking hell judon
not having campbell already makes the rush defense worse and with williams out theyve really got nothing left run stopping wise besides wolfe the pats are just gonna keep grinding until the ravens stop them and idk how theyre just going to all of a sudden do that
ngakoue has been nonexistent since he got here lmao edc that was a good trade it happens but damn has he even gotten a tfl
judon with a stupid fucking flag im shocked
yo why the fuck does it seem like this ref is excited to call penalties on the ravens
its ok well all wake up on january 1st 2021 and realize that 2020 was just a bad dream
gift judon to the jets
judon ejected and comes back with the most costly penalty
commentators talking like the pats already won this game and the way the ravens are playing i dont blame them
our schedule only gets harder the next 2 weeks jesus
what is collinsworth talking about with judon
well that was mcphee not judon
i hate this game
i have to wake up in the middle of the fucking night for these primetime games and they play like this
this is like someone turning the injuries and penalties all the way up on madden
is it too late in the season to sign air bud as our l new head oc
my god can we please move on from the twins who cares who in the planning room thinks the national audience thinks we care about these two this much
boyle just snapped his leg
just broke his leg god what an awesome season
we we are so fucked
cursed fucking game
at this point were the afc 49ers fuck injuries
anyone checked in on the availability of todd heap
what did we do to deserve this injury gods
fuuuuck thats a broken leg
bone just broke fuck this season
down to 1 te fuck this hope boyle isnt as bad as it looks
this sucks like i dont mind losing but i do mind losing player after player after player to injury its like an injury every other play
damn you know its bad when defense calls someone over right away
when it rains it fucking pours
madden curse decided that the team is to be taken instead
yeah were done fuck
i never want primetime again give me my noon games
depending on how bad marlon is hurt this season may be fucked
fuck this season man hope its just a hyperextension
can we please for the love of god throw the ball to duvernay some more
with the playcalling injuries and offensive regression this year this looks like a season where we get into the playoffs as a 106 wild card team and we fail to win a postseason game for the third year in a row
can andrews quit barking after every catch
another illegal formation wtf
what in the fuck the ravens get a damn illegal formation every ducking game
this team is not a good enough product

you want to win the super bowl and cant even go a game without committing the same basic ass procedural penalties what the actual fuck how is this not being drilled into dudes during film and practice
this might be the most lifeless offense ran by an mvp that i have ever seen
this is the same team that struggled hard against the jets lmfao
obviously down what a fucking joke
our front 7 is getting gang banged

our offensive line is like swiss cheese and cannot run block for shit

were getting penalized for incredibly stupid shit and playing undisciplined football

losing stanley this year and yanda from last is huge

not having any legitimate receiving threats outside of mandrews is making our offense anemic
the most important part of the center is snapping the ball if he cant do it he has to be replaced thats like 6 in 2 games that were very very bad
he was definitely down
maybe we should play snead more he seems to make more plays than any other receivers
outside of that awful throw to hollywood this is lamars best game of the year so far
snead iv makes up for the dropped pass earlier on the drive with a td catch
lets go lamar our qb has had a hell of a game outside of the int
that drive with that style of plays in this rain thats some big boy stuff haters can get out
say what you want lamar is a competitor no quit in him
lmao everyone deleting their comments shitting on snead for dropping that pass earlier
imagine that not throwing to the guy who is a foot shorter than the defender results in tds
lol willie snead is easily the number one receiver on this team thats not a good thing
can the rain affect the patriots now please
nice play call for snead he is having a game
this game is winnable but man does it feel like its not even worth it with all these injuries
thoughts and prayers for boyle
need the d to make a big stop here
you know what we are due for a fucking turnover lets do it and take the lead and then just run it down their throats
nobody cares work harder
ive been seriously thinking of making snead my first jersey so expensive lol
this game is gonna be one of those games that give us a heart attack prepare yourself yall
gut wrenching for boyle really hope its not terrible
defense please step up we need you to step up rn
thats one hell of a drive in this shit fucking weather
peters almost took the handoff lol
if we had a true wr1 we could let jackson develop his passing more definitely shows flashes
at least we have the steelers losing in the playoffs to look forward to
please show up d
juiceman stick
boy fruit punch sure has been quiet so far
dont wanna see any lamar slander today one bad play but he has played really well all game not to mention he has to catch every god damn snap with one hand
no flag on judon im impressed
finally some good fucking defense nice stop
he just got chucked
wow someone besides mcphee set the edge properly
defence looked completely different there
omfg lets fucking get a td pleeeeease
clark playing rodeo with that guy lol
we are one scoring drive from being in the lead
if we comeback from 1023 against the patriots in the rain i better never hear that lamar cant come from behind ever again
bad throw by lamar shouldve been an easy first down
snead the mvp of the game rn
idc snead at least puts in effort
this penalty favors the ravens after an unsucsessful drive
fuck amazon theyre profiting off of coronavirus
he didnt get that
oh fuck that spot thats a stop
fuck these spots omg
no way thats a first
thats a bad spot
what a shit spot
terrible spot
fucking horrendous spot
wtf is that spot
get fucked refs
no fucking way he got that
defense is going to have to force a turnover
that was the game changer refs just gave it to them
how the fuck was he that open
so the whiff hold on the first punt a couple missed false starts a semi questionable call on judon still a dumb play by him and then that clearly bad spot

we need to play better to overcome shit like that the only one that really bugged me is the spot because i felt it was such a momentum and field position stop
lets fucking go
sheeeeeeiiiiittttt
i heard someone say its a screen before the play lol
fuck yeah chris board
lets go win a fucking game
come on 7 min td drive
whos board
this feels like 2624 if we play our time wrong
thats how you fucking cover and tackle
d finally showed up washington and wolfe played hard that series lets go ravens
d got us a stop when we needed it lets go lamar shut em all up
lets go boys you can do this
i will personally give proche a manicure and kiss his fingertips after tonights game
lets fucking get it
that move to 34 defense was genius we needed 3 big men in the middle

derek wolfe is a man
lamar youve got this
im so fucking done with skura
how is that not 15
fuck you skura
fucking cut skura
had a drive going but skura fucked us
skura is sus
no way is that not a late hit lmfao
maybe stop playing the pistolshotgun fuck
thats game kids
only pain
wtf was that
whats with these snaps 2 straight games of shitty play by skura
can morgan cox short snap
thanks so much skura
fucking skura holy shit
cant believe were losing to this fucking team
i cant even come up with a clever nickname for matt skura hes just fucking awful
please defense bail out the offense harbaugh please put in mekari
skura fucked us tonight
busted coverage queen
queen playing 5 yards off the first down mark
queen is overrated
queen is fucking ass today in all phases
peters getting held
hold lmaoooo
i have no faith in this team

theyre not dogs on defense the run game hasnt been great

instead of looking towards sb they should be worrying about the browns raiders stealing their playoff spot
peters was being held surely
how do you miss that holding call
this one hurts wont lie all the injuries on top of whats looking like a l just damn man
bro what lmaoooo what was the pentaly
smart by clark tbh
turned off the game this is over this team cant come back even if they get the ball
did the ref say baiting the quarterback

edit got it thanks boys
man all of these harris highlights we were all hitting him standing straight up no one tackling around the waist
3rd and 7 we can stop this and have a chance
this game is pure aids
how are they converting

penalty


run



scramble



pass
to that guy asking if this game was a look ahead game it definitely seems like the defense treated it as such
really rough game another prime time clunker the shitheads are going to talk and theres nothing to even respond with lol
greg roman time to save your job
alright give me some lamar magic please
ryan clark is going to beat his meat live on first take comparing kylers game to lamar
blame of the game tom brady if he doesnt win so many super bowls the patriots dont retain belichick as long which means that we win a few more playoff games the past 10 years and win tonight too
at what point can we stop hearing former special teams coach hes been our damn coach for 12 years
well god hates us

we need a new center
cant even pass the fucking ball downfield 20 yards
what a pathetic way to end this game
unreal this is why lamar needs playmakers
see yall in the post
f them receivers
seemed like a really weak attempt at a series
penalties

injuries

skura

play calling

this game was the definition of shooting yourself in the foot there is no reason this happened like this harbaugh needs to get his head out of his ass and get this shit under control asap
lost it on run defence and skuras bad snaps
weather aside at the end this team has never for as long as i can remember run a 2 minutes drill theres never any urgency that and clock management always been terrible
the castle crumbled tonight injuries galore were going to be 65 on black friday
running back by committee must stop we need to pick a guy and run him 20 times a game switching backs every other play to keep them happy aint it
lamar played well his receivers need to stop dropping the ball and he needs dez activated last week we need a wr that can fight for the ball hollywood gets shut down with good coverage as he cant fight for it like lamar needs him to
to be fair to lamar hes probably trying to carry the team with an injured and lackluster oline horrible passing schemes and mediocre receivers
here comes another week of lamar cant win big games but this swiss cheese defense should get the lions share of blame
so our defense just not gonna come to play today
respect to queen for not falling for that trick too bad his teammates where no where to help him
lmao people blaming that on hollywood delusional
tough throw but this is why hollywood cant be our 1 hes too small to even have a chance to go fight for that ball
jump ball to a midget
that pass was unnecessary but im less worried about lamar because were at least driving down the field im much more worried about our defense making this pats offense look like a playoff team
i wonder if fans of all the other teams are as temperamental as ravens fans good lord we cant handle things not going our way 100 of the time at all
if only we had a 64 reciever that could make those jump catches

miles boykins ghost disappears into the hedges
look i get it that throw was bad
but lamar is 1419 with 167 passing yards plus 26 rushing
hollywood doesnt look slow jc jackson is fast asf
were really missing williams and calais on defense
patrick queen is out here tackling like eric weddle lol
i think roman had ruined lamars psyche

before this season lamar runs there and he probably gets a first if not at least a lot of yards his throw wasnt a bad decision but with the run so open there he shouldve taken those yards all day
skura the drive killer kills more drives than judon extends
fuck the madden cover all my homies hate the madden cover
titans are going to fucking decimate us with this shit run d
henry is going to annihilate us
lamar is still my qb
cam basically walked that in

the fans telling us to calm down can go fuck themselves our defense is awful
man i hope the ravens dont give up as fast as you all do
hear a lot of people complaining about the complaining what exactly would you like fans to take solace in lamars regression the wrs continuing to have zero impact forgetting about andrews on offense injuries piling up an offense that doesnt remotely resemble last years juggernaut

there arent a lot of positives to cling to the ravens are 62 and probably should have beaten pittsburgh but theyve also mostly succeeded against a bad schedule and cannot seem to fix the problems that plague them its incredibly frustrating let people bitch
this sub is so damn biased that was holding the call on justice was fucking obvious and according to the rules the elliot hit was a penalty too
harbaugh has been shit at getting this team prepared for games this year between the penalties and getting dicked by plays like that
remember when we could have drafted dk
elliot is struggling
not sure when they changed the rules to allow blocks in the back
earning that xbox tonight elliott
refs you know there are two teams out there right
were shitting the bed against the team that barely beat the jetsfuck
hollywood is not a wr1
you know what would be sick if hollywood brown could get some fucking separation
i feel a  tweet incoming
we need to use duvernay more as a receiver draft a damn receiver use dez i havent seen dez all night
lamar keeps costing us points on a weekly basis with these terrible decisions
our qb takes an awful shot downfield when we still had 15 seconds and a timeout and yall point the finger at the 58 receiver for not winning a jump ball


make it make sense
halftime adjustments similar to last week vs the colts are needed for us to win hard to change just getting bullied up the middle though
queen is going to have a pff grade in the single digits it cannot be understated how overmatched he is out there he is single handedly responsible for 60 percent of the patriots yardage
fuck you greg roman 4th and 1 and you run a god damn trick play fuck you
everyone says were overreacting

at what point can we admit we dont have it this year
how does greg roman still have a job
the worst part is that we know this offense cant comeback from a deficit
actual bullshit was literally short based on the refs initial spot
here comes the 1st down handoff to mark ingram for no gain
i still have hope but can skura snap the ball correctly 10 times in a row idk
lets get some stunt action on these hoes
least excited i have been about this matchup in nearly two decades i hope we get up and put a statement out tonight
dobbins 80yds 2td

brown 110yds 2td

bryant 60yds 1td


calling it lets fuckin go
bless the knees
alright cmon dst 65 points and i win my fantasy match lets go ravens what time is it
thanks hopkins
im nervous af boys
lets go mothafuckas
lfg flock
everyone get in here ravens playing soon
i hope lamar and the o play loose and drop a 40 points
jo on the intro
marquise was wide open
o line redemption game
ooof look at those wr rankings
i cannot believe ingram is starting when the other 2 have been so good
jk has been eating since ingram has been gone why kill his momentum
wtf justice
hill was getting blocked dont think he saw the fair catch
right back at it to shit play calling and an open book route followed by shooting ourselves in the foot
hill was being held tho
hill couldnt see the fair catch signal while getting held the whole way
whats the point of having souijas who get boundaried
this is not how you keep yourself relevant hill
is that throw to hollywood a 1 read and 1 read only play there was no chance of hollywood getting that
imma need this front office to get lamar some real receivers this is not it
feeling not having campbell out there
hey yannick do something tonight please
we have to lead the league in games played in the rain over the past two years
pff hates the ravens front 7 my god
that pff rank on queen and humphrey is just disrespectful
sacked right out of fg range
has yannick done anything for us as of late
jdn
lets get this passing game going no gilmore should be a feast for lamar
peters is good if he was seriously hurt he wouldnt hop up that quick and jog off
its sucks that we lose a corner every god damn week its even worse that its always on the first or second drive every week
hopefully mp just got a stinger
man we got campbell for this fuck injuries
peters better be ok
peters just gonna have a thigh bruise
dobbins just has so much more burst then anyone else
i liked that jk started the drive
im liking what im seeing on this drive
was that separation
wow we can fucking catch today im so proud
cams hairwtf dude
i feel a lot better when lamar runs out of bounds
this is why i keep saying give it to duvernay
duvernay is faaaaast
our top 3 receivers in order
1 snead
2 duvernay
3 jaleel scott
devin barry allen duvernay
devin duvernay
the bus is running hard today
this has got to be one of the quickest quarters ever
damn gus got bent lol
all this running this game will be over by 10 lol
need iv snead
touchdown ravens
13 plays 94 yards 804

amazing
td we only need about 5 more and ill be happy lets gooooooo been waiting all day
that was a ball crusher of a drive so nice
greg roman on a mission
most impressive passing td of lamars career absolute missile on that throw
just missed the td live near new york and got a tornado warning weather update kinda pissed rn
hell yeah sneeeeaaadd
thats how big ben and mahomes get a 3rd of their passing tds too so ill take it lol
in central jersey totally missed the td for nbc ny to cut in and tell nyc to take shelter due to the front that hit us 40 minutes ago
i will die for snead
honestly a great looking drive for roman nice
i need to see lamar throw for 400 rush for 200 in the same gamemaybe one day
that call was bullshit
soft flag
that flag was bs that tackle was fine
minkah almost koed lamar but i guess that doesnt count
bro how tf did they want him to hit him there
i wanna see a juiceman pick on this drive
man elliot just isnt a smart guy especially after that twitter crap we saw
do we have a run defense
is it just me or does cams helmet look funny
how did we give up that 1st wtf
when offense sucks defense is great when offense plays great defense sucks
that was some shitty coverage
that drive for new england was easy get it together defense
not having campbell is hurting the run defense which means their passing game opens up
there were like 3 chances at a tfl on this drive and they run past the guy with no contact
that was a nifty play
would it kill fluker not to give up pressure for once
dont you just love the way we shoot ourselves in the feet with penalties
how good is a lack of discipline s
how tf has the coaching staff not gotten the penalty situation better killers
diabetes
gus catch and run
eat this fuckin bus bitch
andrews is one handsome mf
i love how gus bus runs through people
really happy lamar has taken a couple wide open checkdowns
diabeetus
lamars decision making has been very impressive
imagine trying to hit gus edwards in stride
at least hochules jr is being consistent
to all those complaining about the earlier call thats the rule this looked worse because it was helmet to helmet silly rule but i get why its a rule
i mean that one was just targeting at least elliott hit the body
at least there consistent there
good call


that time he actually did lower his helmet the one on us was a fair tackle when he was already motion theirs was legitimately a lowered helmet
such a bad play justice hill had no chance
why hill not saying hes bad but all 3 other back have been fire tonight
an average height receiver makes that catch or at least touches the ball
hollywood is just too damn small dude gets out muscled if he cant get separation
surely youve gotta review that andrews catch

edit holding
bullshit call
the way hochule ann9unced that 4th down he sounded excited
automatuck
ball slipped out of his hands or its a td
this is gonna be a slug fest isnt it if so im down
tucker
drink everytime cris and al say rain
a tudder would have been nice but ill take a lead
why does baker mayfield get so many commercials
overall good drive
do these refs want to fuck our oline because theyre looking piss poor if you ask me
can we put justice hill away we didnt fucking use him when ingram was out why now
when were inside the 10 weve gotta go for the end zone if were throwing that 3rd down play dump off to hill was a waste
hollywood needs another stud next to him he is like tyreek hill hill without all those other weapons would not be scary
wtf is this hummer graphic
on a positive note im saving over 70 a month on my car insurance cuz i just switched
that was the 2nd worst graphic after that flacco mnf one
so is ngakoue going to make a play soon or am i expecting too much
defense looks slow as fuck
queen getting pushed backwards on every tackle
our defense pisses me the fuck off today they should be disappointed in themselves so far make a stop god damnit
awful tackling pathetic as fuck
ellis fat ass out there looking stupid
71 is giving up cut his fat ass
honestly defense been carrying hard last few weeks time for our offense to do them a solid
theyre getting 5 ypc this has to stop
the fruit punch is nice but oh my god just tackle them jfc
we are hurting without williams and campbell
good stop wolfe
yannick gets dominated every play
baltimore whats a tackle ravens
can we please stop the run wtf
defense pls
defense is getting worked and the offense still looks uninspired outside of lamar snead and gus
we have no solution for harris ugh
that another missed false start
guys are just dragging ass and running right into blockers
we just really going to let them run this half down and score and then get the ball back huh
any chance campbell comes back next week
god damn injuries are fucking us over i dont like the feeling of this game right now we need to get a fucking stop
this dline is injured and the next guys arent stepping up rn
got to be kidding me
unfuckingreal thats piss poor defense
this is one of the most pathetic defensive efforts ive seen in quite awhile
dlibe just isnt getting any amount of penetration or keeping ol off our lbs it doesnt help that our lbs are consistently getting the direction of the run wrong
why must the ravens always fall for trick plays
okay we had that thing easily stopped what was queen doing
are you fucking kidding me

guys our defense looks awful theyre usually pretty good definitely missing out with the injuries
this is a world class embarrassment
he just let him catch it what the fuck was that
great now i have hear a week full of meyers throws better than lamar jokes
queen needs to get better at coverage man
okay ill take the missed xp
also we never successfully defend those and its aggravating
bill always finds creative ways to fuck us
time for lamar to go ham
queen looked so pathetic trying to cover burkhead
why do those plays always work on us
i really hope bwill is back after the half
is there time to at least tie it up before half we have all our tos right
whenever the ravens get the ball to start the game they struggle this is not just me being paranoid its fact
were about to get fucking destroyed in the media tomorrow max kellerman stephen a smith and shannon sharpe boutta have a field day tomorrow if we lose
its always the patriots with the trick plays against us
never change paul giamatti never change
queen has been getting picked on all game
you can tell how many bandwagons came to this sub last season in these threads
were not scary at all
sacked by 3 people good job o line
well thank god were not the texans
fight for the out of bounds there hollywood
this offense needs serious help in the offseason we have no interior line and we have nothing close to a 1 wr
i know nothing happened but that some hustle after that sack defense wasnt even ready
at least were not the texans right
we throw a sideline route and we cant get out of bounds thats just something
soulja sighting
oof
double coverage
trying to force it to hollywood
ffffffffuuuuuuuuu
we just cant throw the damn ball down the sidelines
brown is to tiny
why would he throw that
why tf would you throw that
holywood gets bitched
whyyyy didnt they just try to go for 3
i feel like missing out on that potential 3 points is gonna really bite us later
why are you going deep instead of a 10 yard out route
man i dont think we have played nearly as bad this game as we started last game but this gdt is somehow even more in the gutter

imagine buying a hollywood jersey this season
stop throwing it to hollywood he is not good enough to beat jc jackson 1 on 1
we have the best gm in the league that being said i cannot fathom how we did not get a possession receiver at the deadline
that dude has 6 picks already lol
and yall are acting like jc jackson is a scrub or something
were absolutely forcing the ball to brown

fuck
guys know they just body brown and it basically neutralizes his speed he needs a wr1 to take the attention off him and he will truly shine hes too smol to be a wr1
whoever is in charge of scouting wrs for the steelers should be brought here they seem to draft stud after stud after stud
see if that pass is thrown to boykin or dez if he was active id have no issue but a 59 wr on a jump ball go type of route just makes no sense gotta be smarter
keep the truzzz
there is a big difference between trusting youre team and blindly following along with the bad decisions calling out the bs isnt being bandwagon
henry will be able to pick the rushing yards he gets next week if calais and bwill cant play jesus
yeah without campbell and williams its going to be a mega problem
harris about to break the all time rushing record
our d line is nothing without williams and campbell
the defense is atrocious without calias or williams
marcus peters giving up a big play and penalty
idgaf what people say about how good we are we shouldnt be getting run over week to week
seriously

x200b

are we really going to lose to the lowly patriots
this is so fucking annoying my god wake up lets go
i hate this fucking game
pathetic showing from the defense so far come on lamar get us back in it here
lmao of course they get the td on the first try
we are making this trash team look good and it sucks
our run defense is an absolute fucking embarrassment tonight this is offensive viewing
we tripping over our own players more than anything else

this is the team who beverly got beaten by the winless jets ffs the jets
we are close to being out of the playoffs we are losing 3 to 5 starters a game im officially worried
our d cant stop anything this game
the whole fucking defense is hurt offense needs to carry this shit out of this game
team is dying out there
there goes bonds
patriots are bad we can win
we have such a drop off from our starters we maybe have some good players but we got no depth no creativity to offset weaknesses and no way to fix it in season

this team seriously needs to keep drafting and make a move for a real wr lamar is gonna keep regressing if we dont help him
williams just got ruled out for the game
at this point i go into games knowing a few starters are going to get hurt its just guaranteed
lmao people still saying god so negative after a 4play 75yard drive
how the fuck does the defense make no adjustments at the half fucking terrible
having thin lbs is useless against the runs if the dl dont eat
lamar needs to shine
i thought pats supposed to have the wrost offense in the league whats happenings
on prime time too is this a trend
never thought id see the day when the game plan to win against us was run it
o line seems to be better in pass pro today lets take advantage of it
this is good we need practice coming from behind
this defense is noticeably better with cambell
if we are relying on the offense to win we might be in trouble definitely not built for that style of play
whatever the overunder is for henrys rushing line next week im putting my entire life savings on the over free money
cris collinsworth really loves sucking cam newtons penis
nice play throw it to dobbins 4 yards behind the los and block no one
am i wrong if i dont have a great feeling about this one
lol thats some funny shit
fire greg roman
hahahahahahah my god
what the fuck is that play call
what the actual fuck
holy shit im done with this game goodnight yall
our team is like that homer simpson meme where his backfat is held my pins
hahahaha i can do nothing but laugh at this point
this team is literally the aim for the bushes scene in the other guys
good night everyoneim done with this shit
what the fuck is even going on can we fire some coordinators did we just take the reigning mvp off the field for a 4th down conversion is this rocket science
why new england of all teams
we have an mvp qb whos our best ball carrier and thats the play we run lmfao
good bye greg
lmao fuck skura
best rushing qb in the league and run the fucking wild cat
skura sucks terrible play call to begin with this is a telling game for all of us this isnt even close to our year
he wasnt going to get that anyway 3 pats beat through the line so sad
bye bye greg
greg roman needs to be fired fuck the wildcat there
greg roman needs to go
to be fair to roman he didnt tell skura and ingram to botch that shit but this is not a good team this year
greg roman is cam cameron level bad right now
secretly i think the ravens are always looking out for us who have to be up early for work on monday or tuesday mornings no need to stay up when we play so poorly just go to bed

of course i will not because i still always hope but if i would learn my lesson from the kc game i would know to just go to bed now
skura dude cmon we dont need these
fire roman invest interior online improve wr prosper
you take the ball out lamars hands
cant blame roman cant blame ingram what the actual fuck was that snap
at this rate well be lucky if we make the playoffs tennessee is going to unleash henry steelers have home field advantage dallas will be rested and well have played 3 games in 13 days browns will unleash chubb its not looking good man
its the same bounce outside run every single time
lets not forget last time ingram got a direct snap he took it to the house just not a good play call in these conditions
this team has so many fucking holes ol ok some bad injuries but still pass rush linebackers safety wr but mostly ol and wr
well with that injury report im going to bed change their luck yall
well people were right about a blowout lol
oh look another 10 yard run on first down
our dline depth is fucking trash
did we actually trade for yannick is he a player
should have thawed out some wings to air fry tonight i fucked up
lamar is a better runner than ingram why would wildcat ever ever ever make sense
imagine a qb having that much time and space
when we say that we should be more lenient on our team because we have some injuries lets not forget that half the patriots opted out before the season this team is objective worse than the one we played last year and they are on trajectory to embarrass us the offense got much worse from 2019
lol judon
is greg roman on twitter i want to bully him
classic judon
i hope we pay judon zero dollars
judon needs to go hes trash
judon pff rank 101 of 110
swear to fucking christ 2021 first team move is show judon the door
this team is not play off ready or deserving zero discipline and we still have roman fucking sad
ah yes another questionable call
so we could miss the playoffs
legit bad call theme of the night
you have to caress him to the ground
this new nfl is so fucking soft dude
never thought i would have to replace the baltimore fucking ravens defense with waiver wire trash in fantasy football
lamar has looked good pasing the ball tn i wish we would let him do it more
even their rules analyst is confused by that penalty
we need a td here anything less and were out of it
its amazing we have a legit shot of missing the playoffs and someone in the nfc east is gonna make the playoffs at sub500
finally a fucking stop but that was because of cams bad throw not our defense
i just hate everything about this year so fucking much
best hope is we get the 5 seed get healthy at the right time and get something going for the playoffs might be foolish but i still have hope we can do it
you know all the shit this team is spewing out aside its wild that every team somehow becomes the most disciplined team in the world when they play us

whole universe against us and we just be like ok and just do nothing about anything and just float on because our record acts like we arent ass
thats a torn mcl probably
who gives a fuck about these two guys theyre twins theyre pretty good i get it
god fucking dammit stop with the injuries
god these injuries
jesus fuck
why is jihad inactive we can use all the help we can get at this point
there goes boyle for the season i think i saw his leg break
madden curse has inflicted the whole team geeeez
boyle too fuck me
holy shit are we at 20 injured players yet it sure seems like almost the entire team is dead at this point
wow im not even mad about the way were playing but these fucking injuries wtf is this
guys is it 2015 or something so many damn injuries
getting 2015 vibes from all these injuries
top priority now is preserve lamar at all costs
worst possible outcomes getting smacked and losing hella key people to injuryand to know the bye week was behind us
this team is cursed
man they shouldve starting flagging hits like that before hits to the head everyone always prefers taking a shot up high than to the damn knee
i miss the days of dudes getting knocked tf out rather than seeing a leg break every week its just sad and its careerthreatening
boyle is quietly top 3 most important pieces to our offense without him this season is looking lost
thats broken or seriously dislocated hes done what a dumpster fire of a game
how did we win 6
the 2015 ravens are making a return but in all seriousness i hope boyle is ok
we went from te power house to our only te being t1 diabetic
this year is cooked guys injuries have fucked us so hard
lol always a flag too get fucked
fuck the refs
nick boyle is a tough dude
fire roman
mark dont celebrate get back to the fucking line and do it again the team is getting embarrassed and you give two fucks about a completion

nice now it doesnt even count as im typing it lmao
hopefully the silver lining is this forces roman to adjust his offense into something fucking else
duvernay with more yards than hollywoods entire season

jk running into a wall of defensive linemen and 4 ravens ol standing around doing nothing like two pairs of tweedle dee and tweedle dumbs

now we can even fucking line up correctly
jackson on point with these throws in this weather
so turns out the procedural penalty was dog shit classic
anyone else remeber when the defenses told the nfl if you dont let us hit them in the chest guys will end up tearing up recievers legs
and a fucking drop holy shit this game has it all
andrews knew it and did not sell it at all
snap the ball idiot they are running players off the field get the easy offsides
obviously down right
he had the 1st down
holy fuck did greg learn to call a normal play on 4th and 1
that play 10 more times k thx
at least they called the right play on 4th and 1 this time not sure how that wasnt the playcall the first time
we have to go faster
this team has every injury possible
orlando brown is fat too lets put him on the dline and see how it works
i really dont care what happens the rest of the game honestly so deflated after all these injuries the rest of the season isnt gonna get better in that department
cut skura
he has a cut on his hand his hand wasnt cut off no excuses for skura
these snaps lol
the rain is falling our all pro left tackle is out for the year 650 pounds is missing on the dline our best downfield te blocker is out for the year the steelers are undefeated this is not the year
i cant stand that annoying fog horn that always plays during the away teams 3rd downs at gillette stadium its obnoxiously loud
why does this team never play with urgency
the need vi snead
fuck that haters lets go llama
lamar putting the team on his back lets fucking finish this
holy shit the pats players are annoying just shut the fuck up
who would have thought willie would have 2 tds tonight
i have the need

the need for snead
sneads the kind of guy who needs to step up in this game and he just did
snead 1 receiver
lamar cant throw
lamar throwing dimes in the rain
we need to win in memory of nick boyle legs
great passing from lamar that drive even with all the rain
lamar looks pissed even after that td pass wish we could see what he would do with a better oline and better recievers
this really could be lamars big game showed a lot if mettle on that drive from lamar
now the def needs to get a turnover force a 3 and out something
good drive defense needs to step up and make a stop
god please defense dig down somewhere and get a stop
cmon defense need a stop then we in this
at least willie came to play tonight
we suck were trash lamar imma carry the team
snead been looking good the past few weeks
boykin is out there running around just trying to lose his breath
lets goooo but why are they even allowed to play in this typhoon
i missed up to midway through the 3rd quarter so i dont know how we got into this hole but if they can drive it like that in the rain we have a chance here good job by lamar and many others
snead wr1
defense needs a stop or a to gotta show up
lamar is fucking back
puppy pissed on the floor i stepped in it with my new ravens socks do with this info as you will fuck
juiceman
ball so hard university
put some respect on my man sneads name
i dont like some of the shots lamar is taking i know hes strong but theres literally an example on the other sideline of a qb that has taken too many big hits in his career
that shot deep at the end of the first half is looking really bad rn
we really need a quick stop and keep the momentum
defense hasnt done much all game its time for them to step up
uhhhhh was that marcus peters lfg
peters is a beast
have marcus peters play pass rush bois
only positive is lamar is balling if the rest of the team held their weight the story would be lamars playing like last year
i hate when judon makes 1 good play then gets up like hes jj watt
is marlo still out on the field or is he actually injured
quit knocking judons effort
random irrelevant suggs graphic
defense did a thing
huge stop
3 and out ok lets build on the momentum
i miss ray lewis so much right now
wow that was amazing defense
yaaaasssss d
lmao 3andout
did i just enter an alternate timeline where the ravens defense isnt a steaming pile of hot kaka
yes
anyone wanna see a long hollywood td
we got this boys come on lamar get that team the w
trailblazer is such a joke of an offroader compared to jeep and the new bronco lmao
i think were gonna block a kick this game our dude has just barely missed the timing by a hair every time their kickerpunter is in the game
lets let lamar fucking rip let him do whatever the fuck he wants honestly
if theres a time for lamar to silence the media for saying he cant win in big games and cant win from behind this is the game
get ingram out of the game plz
wouldnt mind ingram not getting the ball anymore
love ingrams personality but hes done as a 1
lets get it for boyle
take ingram out of the game smh
lamar shouldve run that
wait so judon gets a hit on a defenseless receiver but that isnt
and thats a breakdown of this offense lamar does something dumb to waste a down and then we fall short on 3rd down
snead putting the team on his back who woulda thought
you were wide open to run
holy shit what a punt though
good punt plus half the distance to the goal
snead at least getting open
same fucking play as the first punt of the game good to see they called it this time
koch beautiful kick man
turnover time
i wonder if lamar has been told not to run because of field conditions
i know punting is 100 the right play but damn i want us to go for it every time on fourth and short
i dont know of this is an unpopular opinion but i think hollywood is a replaceable wr and i dont think we should resign him because i have a feeling hes gonna want a lot of money
didnt like hollywoods body language there i get he wants touches but you arent getting open he tried to force you the ball once and it got picked he needs to get open before he complains about his play
whenever ingram is out there this offense just looks so bleh i know we gotta give him his reps but jk is just too good to keep on the bench feed jk the ball pleaseee rowman i need more jk
jesus that amazon commercial was long as fuck
please just stop them just this once
who ready for that greg roman fired upvote party
just sell out on the run if cam beats us with his arm so be it
gashes us for 9 fucking come on
did cary williams grow dreads
wow
fucking cheating ass spot wtf
horrible spot
all we had to do was not give up a 9 yard run
no way he got that first down
terrible spot
bad spot again
free first down
harbaugh challenge the ball is visible
wolfe is playing good tonight
why is he wide open in the flat
im sorry what that was short and the ref slipped and put it a few inches further than he meant to what the fuck
fuck judon ball out or something equal out the refs bs
derek wolfe is a goddamn tank
why did that dude just give up on going for the sack
we have the slowest pass rush i swear on exacerbates our poor passing offense when our d cant hang with a good o
honestly cant watch these refs i dont know whats a penalty
nfl needs a better system to decide ball placements the refs are just humans they definitely get the ball wrong by at least a few inches every time theres a rumble play on the line like that
yannick with a nice pressure
huge play
yannickk
chris board idk who he is but i like him
we got a ballgame ladies and gentlemen
lmao lamar
defense stepped up again now we need the offense to do as well
o line needs to step up now and force the ball down pats throat
we have to time this well us going down and getting a score just to go up 1 with too much time left i know this pats team aint winning a super bowl this year but thats still a position you dont want to be in
thats why the d is are thing
hollywood is frustrated and i hope lamar doesnt try to force feed him
time to shut up the haters lamar this is what they said you couldnt do
dad just showed me the replay of the ref butchering the spot runs out and grabs the ball looks down does a cha cha slide to the right and spots it a yard farther
fuck you skura what the fuck
please cut skura
skura is fucking killing us
send skura to the cfl
please fucking bench skura for the love of god
skura is shitting all over himself i wonder if its in his head at this point
three bad snaps game losing mistakes
god 3rd and 15 bc of skura
bench skura
god awful throw
maybe we should put lamar under center a few times
lamar got lucky as fuck
skura gotta go
horrible throw
skura snapped this fucking game away
move mekari to center
it hasnt just been the last 2 games hes done this his whole career
skura its that the same guy that has been waived and cut by us like 3 times lol
skura sucks get paid millions to snap a fucking ball
when our offense was good our defense sucked now our defense is good our offense sucks
skura ruined the 4th and 1 earlier and now this
okay we need a turnover right fucking now to keep the streak alive lets hunt boys
got lucky there horrible throw 8
has there been one clean snap tonight i mean good lord skura give our offense a damn chance
who else on the ravens can play center matt skura aint it
you cannot have a center who cant snap the ball and its raining i put that on the coaches as well his hand injury is known and was surely seen in practice
our 20 pt streak on the line
cox is snapping the ball 10 plus yards perfectly in this weather get skura tf outta here
come on queen
dude what in the fuck throwing into triple coverage to hollywood mind numbing not like it was going to get converted but come the fuck on
still hard to believe there wasnt a flag on that ground hit if somebody slammed on brady after a play was over there would be yellow everywhere
surpise surprise queen doing nothing in coverage
our defense fucking sucks
jakobi meyers played qb no fucking way collinsworth
did you guys know that jakobi meyers played qb at one point
no foul peters was held like crazy
so cam gets the call but lamar doesnt
they wont even get the ball back with this defense lol
lamar actually got hit in the head
two ravens records are about to fall defensive turnover and 20 points
this is embarrassing man new england is fucking horrible how is this fucking team playing so bad
this game has just been miserable to watch
what the actual fuck was that
gonna need a miracle
i feel like we are in this position often can we please win one of these
the football gods owe us
chris collingsworth is so dumb maybe he has something special for this punt no dumbass
did it just start pouring even more great
looks like mother nature dont want us to win smh
it is pouring lmao can they even finish this shit
linemen are holding receivers arent getting out of bounds end of days weather
okay do when we cant see downfield and collinsworth can and says run lamar that tells you all you need to know about our receivers
god hates the ravens lmao
hahahahahahaahah of course i couldnt do anything but laugh there
god hates the ravens apparently
miserable game
top to bottom team was a complete joke
this team doesnt deserve the playoffs
as if the next two weeks schedule wasnt brutal enough the ravens are now the fodder for the official new england patriots resurrection from the dead on the way to a surprise playoff berth and run
edc needs to make to some power moves on the offensive side of the ball you have given lamar zero offensive weapons
people blaming hollywood are dumb asf he had no chance to catch that ball it should have never been thrown
trying to force feed hollywood like he that guy lmaoooooo
i have never seen so many commercials for such a trash as qb such as baker mayfield
if we dont beat new england we dont get past the first round in the playoffs this year full stop
queen getting toasted in coverage once again
guys you cant be blaming hollywood for that pick he was very well covered and the ball shouldnt have been thrown to him
well ive decided imma just stay off this game thread for the rest of the night people here just being way too stupid
fuck all of you pessimists its one thing to be upset with how our d is playing its another to say the game is over and our season is fucked its not even half time
go tf to bed if you dont like watching the game ffs
in typical harbs fashion there will be no major shakeups after this bullshit game
were losing this shit well be tied with the fucking browns while captain fat fuck is undefeated what a fucking collapse after having the year we had last year embarrassing
its not a ravens game if we dont do some dumb shit on a punt
called it
do we have a defense

the people that make commercials shouldnt have jobs that money could go to something useful
man maybe some of you all should just go to bed lol
lmao put the game to bed you let meyers drop a fucking dime like that
um queen
steelers loss is gonna prove huge down the stretch
i love snead we need to use him a lot more

brown is so small
thats fine first bad play by lamar all game
lamar loves turning the ball over when were in scoring ramge
why did lj throw up that shit pass terrible
anyway it was a good offensive half with a bad ending were guaranteed a defensive turnover this half and well keep it moving on offense we good
everyone make sure you dont get too negative just close your eyes and pretend nothing is wrong

anyone checked on the availability of haloti nghata
lets make it 2017 cmon lets get it going
hahahahahaha good night
this team is a dumpster fire
its getting harder to defend against the haters every week fucking sad
wheres dez at
what happened to all of the fans telling us to tank for a better pick
skura has lost this game
thats not a raven lamar
cut skura man put mekari in
i am actually legit shocked we lost to this trash team
last week was for the afc north this week was to be at least playoff contenders we blew both games
pathetic mentally weak

this ne team aint even good what a sad game
nobody gets excited about a good centre but you really do notice the effect that a shit one can have on killing an offence
im confused what were some of you expecting brown to do phase through jcs body magically to catch that horrible pass that was piss poor decision making by lamar period
defense needs to stop the run period i dont know how many times i thought oh hes going down and the rb somehow blows bythrough 5 of our defenders
then yall wonder why rnfl doesnt take us seriously
i really dont want to watch them play another prime time game this season
i hate how fucking poorly coached this team is it is such a piss off watching a team with high potential shoot themselves in the foot repeatedly
this sub is a cesspool of human garbage at times who the fuck even are you clowns
someone said lamar looks horrible like that wasnt his first bad decision of the half lol you fans are unbearable
calm down guys
removed
already starting off with a lack of discipline nice
hopefully just a charley horse
worst defense i seen since the chiefs game maybe all those injuries starting to show now
so you can do an illegal pick as long as its not past the line of scrimmage hmmm
it would be the most ravens thing for the o to look elite and the d take a complete shit and let ne win
what on earth is cams hair its like it has hands
being mediocre feels even worse than being flat out bad at least when youre flat out bad its easier to emotionally disconnect
remember when the ravens had the best defense in the league

pepperidge farms remembers
i appreciate this bully ball from ne teams dont do that to us often
embarrassing
imagine being a top 3 defense arguably the best defense in the league and we cant stop one of the worst offenses in the league god damn when its not one thing with these team its the other
how do the pats constantly find ways to score off plays like this every fucking season
the jets embarassed this team last week whats our excuse for this
patriots so confident they take the to lmao dont blame them tbh after what ive seen so far
hollywood had no chance at that really poor decision
we had these games all the time with flacco guys

remember when we lost to blaine fucking gabbert in 2011 on primetime when we choked against the chargers that same year that was a 124 team that was so much better than the 106 super bowl team the next year

its fine just hope for an indyesque second half i think well be a much better second half team tonight
i agree that hollywood is not doing a good enough getting separation but blaming him for that int is ridiculous that throw and decision was atrocious
people forgot the times hollywood was open early this season and lamar just missed him couple times in the chiefs and washington game come to mind
i never wanna hear hollywood complain about targets when hes being put in alcatraz by jc jackson when lamar is trying to give him the ball
we gonna be fine if the d can pick it up
this is trash
still think us doomers are wrong
if we go and throw 2 out of the next 3 plays im going to bed
adios greg roman
every time roman calls a play there should be a laugh track playing immediately after
here we fucking go this is why i fucking hate th only down by 3 mentality the fucking momentum has to be taken into consideration
fuck greg roman please fire this stupid shit already that was the dumbest play call ever
i consider holding them to a fg after the botched snap a positive to build on
yea season is over when do yall want to have the lamar contract extension discussion
our offensive line

lt orlando brown filling in for stanley

rt bradley bozeman 6th round pick

c matt skura coming off of a acl mcl pcl and dislocated knee injury

rg ben powers i dont think hes ever started a game before

rt patrick mekari udfa and first time playing tackle tonight
every single week what is john harbaugh doing this is the most undisciplined any harbaugh team has looked ever


edit undisciplined
we have 2 burners in hollywood and duvernay and ive seen zero wr screens blasphemy
a long drive that ends with a td would break our backs rn we gotta stuff them back here
its sad that ngakoue hasnt gotten a sack for us yet but he has been our best pass rusher easily since we got him
ugh i havent been this stressed since election day
skura just lost us this game
terrible throw and decision
patriots mvp matt skura everybody
a dropped pass followed by a pre school snap go fuck yourselfs
why the fuck is skura still in the game
watch this count as a big game loss for lamar but last years against patriots dont
see ya next week flock
this is one of the worst losses of the last few years
cut skura
we just lost to the patriots
its a coaching problem outcoached
harbs and eric need to get to the root cause of this shit at the end of the year something is terribly wrong
im still rooting for roman to get the boot so we can move to a billshawkscards offense

i maintain this offense limits lamar so much with his arm with these shit passing concepts
ravens offense is too predictable

ravens try something different

omg why are we doing trick plays


some very fickle fans
ravens thankfully have a crap schedule and can probably win 10 games just by beating dal jax cin nyg theyll probably beat cleveland too because they stink but ten and pit are ls
end the fucking game take the l lets save the embarrassment shit is looking like checkdown flacco years again roman ruins another qb and harbaugh is too chicken shit to do anything
the only good thing about this year is biden winning
fire greg roman cut skura

this team is ass
id give a limb to be half as good at something as dhop is a football
hey offense just pretend the colts game never ended so just keep doing what you were doing
lesssss go cant wait
lets goooooo ravens i hate waiting so long
fuck the pats im glad they suck now
i am hype maryland drivers are terrible but they are not as bad as massachusetts or connecticut drivers big truss
we are going to feast tonight i want to see that second half last week ravens all night tonight lets go
are any dogs in the house
this game should be a slaughter
hoping with all the scrutiny the ravens coaching staff has received we see our offense light it up today
bruh cam newton has 2 td passes and 11 ints this is the biggest fall off to a superstar ever
cris collinsworth looks old as shit lol hes aged 20 years since the last time i saw him
im ready
imo were a better team but the combination of roman being trash and going against bellichick has me kinda nervous
why tf does lamar have to play in so many rain games that combined with having early leads in so many games is a huge reason his passing numbers are low which nobody ever mentions
why tf does the us have so many damn commercialsit shouldnt take this long to watch a game
caw caw mfers
imagine prime jo on this offense wait he was never not in his prime
lets goooooooo
hope this is a madden worthy game
looks cold and rainy gus busssssss
i am once again asking everyone here if they know where i can get harbs mask
lol yikes to those pff rankings for our receivers
skura 3037 on pff damn lol
jfc that was close
former ravens superstar john simon
i already like what i see from playcalling and protection im checking out for the night to just watch god speed
cmon awareness
hill come on man
at least our o line isnt fucked this game
hill would have been able to see the fair catch if he wasnt being held the whole time
why yall mad already i liked that drive we took a shot and lamar looked good dropping back
nice pass by lamar brown just didnt separate
well that was an uninspiring opening drive

lets see what the defense has in store
130 am here on a monday i hope we win this shit or im gonna be pissed
watching that hopkins catch makes me really think what could have been maybe he could teach our young guys to get separation also he could make contested catches
anyone else see that hollywood was wide open on the first play of the game i think lamar knows he missed it which is why he forced that throw on third down
im just embarrassed for this offense
im just frustrated we whiffed on boykin and maybe hollywood when the last two drafts were stacked with really good wrs
so they just going to gash us
wtf is that tdint ratio
could we maybe tackle with arms and stuff
yall saw murray to dhop we need that fr lol
f thepats
holy shit harrison
leek with the huge hit in the backfield
harrison bout to murder this offense lol
missing calais
you forget how big can newton is


nope no hes fucking enormous
i hate cris collinsworth
well so far the inept patriots offense is moving better then ours
yikes judon
theres no way queen is 80 out 88 nfl lbs lol none
okay judon did something cheer
fucking finally judon
look at judon making a positive play
god our secondary cant catch a damn break
a positive judon moment
oh shit judon got a sack
walk it off marcus
jesus no more injuries in the secondary please
so we have 1 healthy corner
damn this stream is way behind


good job judon
great more fucking injuries
god injurys suck
ugh please not be serious
a few notes on baltimores defense gdowning14


the ravens have allowed 178 points per game this year the fewest in the nfl
they have forced 17 fumbles the most in the nfl nextbest team has 10
they have a takeaway in 21straight games the nfls longest active streak
will we ever have a year without a million cb injuries doubtful
was that knee on knee if so he could be ok but obviously that will hurt like a mfer for a while
run the damn ball
why do we keep running into each other dbs and wrs
please let the juiceman be alright
i miss having confidence on the offense was such a wonderful time
our cbs are made of tissue paper
peters 3
tsps for peters just rub some dirt on it youll be fine
heres a ravens drinking game every time we motion the te and we end up running that way take a shot
did guy just pancake fluker
i love that formation they were in
mark andrews on
mandrews always feeling it
collinsworth lamar gets effective when andrews is wide open
keep that pace boys
this first quarter went hella fast haha

gonna be a runheavy slugfest
yes use the short routes and generate yac
snead with the clutch
that mullet omg
we like our guys

oops wrong sport
snead has been our 1 receiver lately
yea need for snead
duuuuuuuv
devin duvernay
great drive
duv is such a beast with the ball in his hands would be a great rb if we werent stacked there
charlie work gus
snead with the moves lmao
need 4 snead
sneeeeaaaad
just like we all expected tonight
lets fucking go guys
yes snead
great drive man
that toss was
jet sweep so effective lately in the red zone glad we used it too
we have run plays tonight i havent seen us run before i love it
i feel like last year the game that really showed how good the ravens were was against the patriots lets hope thats the case and we destroy the pats
willie looks faster this year
woo yay touch passes
im igzn and i approve this drive
everyone always talking about how snead is a wr3 but hes always the one to get it done

half problem with opportunity but still stands
nbc decided to interrupt the broadcast to tell us about a tornado warning several counties away

come back to willie snead celebrating nice
offense not looking bad at all
we have so many speedy wrs i love how they are finally utilizing that on screens and runs they might not be able to get open downfield but they sure as hell can outrun people sidetoside get them the ball quick and just let them try and miss a few defenders awesome playcalling by roman
i dont know what gr did for play calling but dont stop
wow fuck off
fuck im going back in the bathroom
fair call hes in a position to break his neck
i really hope this doesnt turn into a penalty fest
dude wtf
wtf was that bullshit call
30 yards in penalties on completely stupid actions never ever change
elliots losing that xbox left and right
lol sharp throw ok there was not a defender within 6 yards of him
this next beer is for all my homies who gotta get up early for work tomorow
run defense is absolute shit
not liking our rush d so far
it pisses me off that play converted fucking make the play and tackle the runner
brandon williams hurt ankle smh
that wasnt a pick
offense finally shows up and the defense stays on the bus
that was pathetic defense on that drive
williams is hurt theyll run all over us if he cant get back out there injuries are really mounting on us in our most difficult stretch
thats not how you wear a mask cam
well we gave cam his first passing touchdown in 4 games
man its almost like our d took the madden curse from lamar
yo they just played some fm 84 lol
man pull of a timing route with a bad snap impressive
not liking the 3 rb system give the ball to dobbins and gus
gus bus
gus touches ball good things happen
gus bus
anyone who watches ravens games shouldnt be surprised andrews is up there lol
penalty on ne
okay is gus catching the ball he needs start over ingram
yep call that on us call that on them
head to head thankfully they noticed theres two teams out there
dobbins got fucking thrown lol
soulja needs to learn to social distance from corners
how tf are you guys calling these soft calls both were flags idgaf
terrible cutback use your speed and run forward
with that 9yard scramble lamar jackson joins cam newton as the only nfl qbs to produce 500 yards rushing in each of their first three seasons jamisonhensley
brown had a step lamar sailed it a bit get over it we know hes 58
somebody tell that douchebag mullets were funny in high school grow up
defense gotta show up lets get a 3 and out
this is going to be a turnover battle i think whoever wins that wins the game tonight
needed 7 there time for the d to give it back with some time on the clock
are you supposed to wash jerseys
it was a weak call but it wouldve been 4th down anyway ill take the jt points
it looks like this is going to be a close game
gonna give up 200 rushing yards ffs
is harris like derrick henry in disguise
alright pls get the stop d
71 low effort as fuck
campbell is on ir
tackling man are we not getting live reps in practice
man we have been decimated with injuries
our interior d line is soft af without williams and campbell
we need williams back ellis is getting owned at the line
tackle the motherfucker already
edc all i ask is give lamar a stud wr1 please
rain decent blocking defense getting scorched off the ball
harris is gonna have hella yards after contact
defense seems so uninspired rn just going through the motions
we really need campbell out there smh
going in tied at 1010 at halftime and not getting the ball is not how i expected this game to go
hey all im late to the party is campbell playing today i kind of got the feeling from harbaughs interviews that he might miss a few games
come on defense
tramon williams out there in 29
i hope calais and bwill are back next week
they take the lead before half then get a scoring drive to start the second im gonna be real worried with this defense
its pissing out rn i dont think this is indicative of our actual defensive capability
run it unless its 3rd down then pass fml
hey who gets the ball at the second half
looking lethargic out there front 7 getting their asses handed to them
lamar is having his second best game of the season and its going to be a 10 point half our team is weird
there literally is no backup plan when your starters go out you cant just put backups in and expect them to play like the starters especially when you have this many injuries
relax guys were a second half team
i am so fucking angry right now
this defense must be drunk what the fuckkkk
how do nfl teams still fall for that
embarrassing
i saw that from a mile away
aight lets go into the half up 4 who says no
edelman ptsd
trash defense tonight huh
jfc how didnt d attempt to even do anything half our problems are everyone giving up
he missed
god i really fucking hate that flea flicker
queen is good but he is also a rookie
that was a dime tho lol
nick is folking trash
week 16 vs cleavage 20 lessgo
obviously the defense isnt up to play today lamar and the offense are gonna have to go mnf rams on them
fuck 2020

seriously
drafted queen for his sideline to sideline speed and to help in coverage
hes only been good in run defense not like that matters so far tonight
reminder that our dline is missing two of our best run stoppers
a fucking minute left until halftime and here we are with yet another commercial break lol
this defense is giving me diarrhea
fluker getting beat bad
oh boy this ol is not holding up in pass protection
now would be a good time for a screen low risk with chance of big yards also keeps receiving close to sideline so we can stop the clock
moar commercials
duuuuuuuv
goat tucker gonna even this up
this weather is horrible lamar is doing really nicely
fluker is getting dusted off the snap every play
good catch but roll out of bounds lol
absolutely awful throw
what an awful decision
god awful throw
why just why lamar
lamar makes so many decisions this year that i just cant believe
thats on lamar
we couldve gone for 3 but he got greedy
bruh
iq
the one thing lamar couldnt do and he did it
hollywood just cannot ever get open
that was dumb
why does he throw to a guy when hes covered
unnecessary shot even if complete were probably kicking a fg
another prime time game and crap showing
stupid throw and horrible positioning by hollywood
smh terrible decision we needed a fg not a shot down field
well that was awful time for adjustments and some 2nd half dominance
dude begging for the ball but cant get open
that madden curse
covered underneath and overtop no arc not a good time
why throw jump balls to hollywood dude had him blanketed would rather see dez out there
say what you want about his passing ability but it really feels like lamars decision making has taken a nosedive this season im shocked
now well get run on missing key run defenders terrible first and goal series and that pick
dez or duv wouldve made that catch im so over hollywood
fuck man imagine having a receiver like hopkins i bet we would ruin him tho fuck man
hollywood needs to work out or something he thinks he can be like tyreek hill but hes just not fast enough
i dont want to watch this defense play football anymore today
defense is just getting anally excavated

we need to stop them on the ground they come out and just run on us long second half
as long as new england keeps running theyll win this game
my god we need campbell
patriots hot knife

ravens run d butter
loveeee the run defense
wow our backup dl is killing us
queen is really struggling tonight
queen is having a roughhhh game
we are too focused on forcing the fumble with how bad they are gashing us make the tackle
yea this game is over
derrick henry gonna run for 1000 yards against this team
run defense is joke a rn
fucking peters dumbass
im just gonna see how high i can get before i fall asleep
lmao how does the run d get worse
holy crap the ravens suck this patriots team is utter trash
queen has some serious issues bring the downvotes
harrison looks lost
so fucking bad lol
that 2nd qtr int is going to be the nail in our coffin this defense is not getting a stop
were gonna fuck around and lose this game
fuck off

nice flop
defense couldnt stop shit right now man wtf
queen looks bad this game
yikes lol well at least well get to see lamar air it out
this defense is eye torture
and more injuries on top of it fuck my life
and there goes the only starter on our defensive line
unbelievable
where are our linebackers
if we lose wolfe in this game theyll finish this game running for 200 yards
are there enough defensive linemen to finish the game
why tf our defence look so shit today
oh god hoping the injuries arent too bad
2015 war flashbacks
halftime adjustments are a problem for harbaugh sometimes it seems like they just went in the locker and didnt talk at all
ill cut off my pinky to not have any more injuries this season and get everyone back
we need to sign some of these vet ogs that just got into free agency and look for another cb
missing the preinjury defense
argh this fucking run d
play like this in prime time smfh
offense needs to ball out like in the second half of last week or were in big trouble
patriots almost lose to the jets but theyre walking right through us like its nothing
andrew will be the xfactor in this comeback im calling it
man its like nobody wants to tackle at all today
even if our offense can score i just dont see us winning with this run d its shit right now
8 rb carries

19 passes
will calais be good to go next week
henry is salivating right now
i wish i got payed millions to suck at my job if i performed like they do at my job my ass will in the unemployment line
cardinals were down 239 earlier

this can change
this team aint built to come from behind oh boy
and theres the jinx
i cant watch the game someone please wipe the camera lens
fluker got benched lol
calm down roman we got this
oh snap thats right powers is in
i knew we would play like trash tonight
awful play call on 3rd my god
fluker pulled mekari rt powers rg

why are we doing a direct snap to ingram in that situation why
nice snap asshole
what the absolute fuck was that are you kiddijg me
lmao what is this game
good game not goodnight
wellthis is a joke
fuck off
what the fuck
hot take that wasnt great
yes lets take it out of lamars hands hes the only option at this point
a head might have to roll after this embarrassing ass shit
awful snap but why the fuck are we going wild cat on a 4th and 1
yes keep the ball out of our best players gr the wildcat should do it very smart play calling
ive withheld it as long as i can offense line struggles or not greg roman needs to be fired
why would roman call that just why
can someone tell me why skura cant get down the snaps
wish we had peko rn
who was the dude that was full mast over the play calling another fan who doesnt know football
why did we cone out in the wildcat
and if youre going to do a direct snap keeper at least snap it to the best rb on the team not the worst
welp a td pretty much seals it gotta golf them to a fg or less
im too drunk to go to the store and get more liquor but not drunk enough to be calm through this
thats just good blertimor footbirds pigball
the ravens moved patrick mekari to right tackle to replace dj fluker ben powers is at right guard mekari hadnt played tackle in the nfl before today but he spent time at that spot in college aaronkazreports
with lamar its like were constantly in a wildcat all that did was take the pass potential out of the offense

can any of our corners force a fumble here please
sowe getting rid of greg roman yet dude fucking sucks
we need to completely fix our oline wrs and edge rushers this offseason yikes
you know that harbaughs angry neck vein is just throbbing under his mask tonight
on the brightside we didnt go through much adversity during the regular season last year and i think it hurt us come playoff time if we get in the adversity and hopefully players coming back will make us better adept to handle adversity bout the only bright side i can see now
this is embarrassing
you have lamar jackson under center by default for fucks sake

what does greg roman do snap it directly to the worst by far and also freshly back from injury rb jesus fucking christ greg better be fired after this what a dumb piece of shit
bro im straight up not having a good time
our defense cant fucking stop shit right now this game is fucking over if the pats score here fuck greg roman
i might have to stop watching before this gets ugly
call the game
lol theyre going to run for 810 yards on every play for the rest of the game and were not going to make any adjustments or do anything about it
x200b

injuries are going to be the excuse for tonights piss poor performance and for the forseeable future

x200b

duly noted

run all over us baby the fucking dogshit patriots are absolutely dominating us
our whole team is dead lmao
run d is absolutely depleted by injuries rn and its obvious
we go down 17 and its over at this point 13 might be to much for us
queen is not making tackles tonight
every week judon fucking god can we please just cut him
judon with his trademark play he fuckin sucks
judon your are by far the most skilled idiot on this team
bro what the fuck how is that possibly a fucking penalty on us
edit jk fuck off
thats a garbage call
im laughing because its better than crying
who is judon
judon please goooooo away
welp was debating whether to go to sleep and this seals it if we somehow win i will wake up happy if not i expect us to lose
i dont think ive ever seen as talented a squad in any sport that doesnt believe they can win the instant theyre down by even a single point

gameplan goes out the window and the heads go down its so bizarre and its becoming part of our culture and it feeds the narrative that is throw around for every one of these games

and this isnt even a good team were playing tonight
judon wtf was that
death taxes and matthew judons stupid bum ass getting an unnecessary roughness foul

that fucking clown is stealing a living
yeah idk man

the pats ol has taken over the game our defense is committing 15yd roughing penalties left right gro is losing his mind now as well

how in the world are we going to win this game
bs call
it isnt just the injuries on the oline or the dline or the lack of talent at receiver or the bad play calling or the regression of lamar its also the complete and total lack of anything resembling discipline this defense gives up so many bullshit unnecessary penalties its embarrassingly bad and they dont improve its like theyre not even concerned about it
judon will be lucky to get 10 mil this offseason
its raining outside
wtf is going on its not like theyre throwing the ball further than 5 yards so can somebody figure it out here
marlon seemed to be grabbing his armshoulder
field goal fuck i was prepared to just go to bed now i have to keep watching this shitshow
good stop needed to keep it a 2 possession game
cam is ass i stg if it wasnt raining wed be winning by a mile



but if my aunt had a dick shed be my uncle d needs to step up
hate to a debby downer but we could go on a 3 game losing streak if we lose tonight with the titans and steelers coming up
the fact that that drive ended in a fg is a damn blessing we need to wake up and stop making such bad mistakes
historically ravens football is having an amazing defense and subpargood offense
what the shit is happening
say what you want about boykin at least he didnt tweet that stupid shit
well every time i watched from outside we scored so i guess ill take one for the team and watch the rest of this game in the freezing cold
i really dont even know anymore i can say fire roman but in a covid season who tf would even replace him were also playing with guys literally off the street some of these guys i didnt even know was signed to the team lol
you didnt want to be the team playing from behind in this one the weather is an abomination if the ravens dont get a td on this drive its over theyre not gonna march down the field in 3 minutes late in the game
we werent gonna get the 1 seed anyways all that matters at this point is making the playoffs
hily fucking shit
lamar needs to put this on his back and stop counting on hollywood to contribute short plays screens open up the middle of the field for him the deep ball anywhere near 15 is a no go
oh fucking god boyle thats bad
broken leg
boyle is done
fuuuuuck boyle noo
duck
injury to insult
til how to separate the mccourtys thanks snf
can we forfeit before more injuries
hospital ball
that was a loud snap sound
patriots yoooo we just broke dudes leg better get him some help b
2020 can just fuck off
everything is shit i want off this planet fuck everything
and now boyle good season
thats boyles season
ah yes an injury to another starter is just what we need hope boyle is ok
not another injury
starting to feel like 2015 with the injuries piling up
at this point just forfeit to avoid more injuries between greg roman and the rain this offense is doomed
seriously we actually need to stop playing just to make sure we dont lose anyone else
gdamn i dont even care anymore
season isnt worth all these guys getting hurt
i swear i heard his leg crack
fuck this bullshit were done
delete this season
why are you guys saying andrews it was boyle
can we just go back to week 1
a cart is being brought out for ravens te nick boyle per
mikereiss jamisonhensley
weve run 2 slants for 25 yards and 2 first downs
its gonna be a rough second half of the season boys
carted off so thats definitely season over will the ravens have enough players to field a team
fuck well as long as the steelers pats or bucs dont win it all this year ill consider the season a success
my god the replay looked bad
duvernay is already better than marquise blockbuster brown
can we play with some urgency or energy
how was there 6 patriots jerseys and not a single lineman blocking on that run
fire greg roman now
why did they show that
with boyle gone might as well pack it in
and his best pass of the day is ruined by not lining up correctly
what a fucking surprise
im actually scared for our other guys now this year has had terrible injuries
i got downvoted into oblivion for calling that a dirty ass play in the rnfl game thread am i insane that guy was hunting boyles knee
our fucking receivers arent even good at lining up wtf
are you fucking kidding me what bullshit
horrible drop by snead
this is the worst coached team in football we consistently cant lineup correctly
whoops gotta make up for that bullshit call
i mean that has to be a record for most illegal formations in a season
like of course the rain just comes down like this as soon as the patriots are up like why the fuck wouldnt it
if anything thats a first down from forward progress
love you gus
gussss
gus is why im still watching
put mekari at center if skura cant snap
get bozeman at c
enough of skura enough please
why is skura still the centre
were turning into the 49ers with these injuries lmfao

this offense is a ghost of what it was last year
we need a real fucking oc
btw where tf has chris moore been this season like he lose a leg or something
why tf we still sleeping on our real 1 rb gus the bus sure hes a starter now but hes just the 3rd guy in rotation man
please just gus and lamar for now on no more ingram even though i really like ingram
that just cant happen
remember hollywoods huge debut against miami i want that hollywood back
the only thing holding this offense back is greg roman and our defense is hurting without campbell and williams
queen getting manhandled by a rb jesus
short
god how are we letting burkhead do this to us
lamar needs someone to make a play in each level consistently andrews has more good days than bad 3 rb that i believe lamar trust to make the plays when they matter but in wr its just snead which his average isnt that great boykin a non factor hollywood just no and duvernay is kind of a gadget player so far
he didnt get it
definitely short
queen needs to play with more meanness next season i want big hits on the middle not 9 yard gashes
you know theyre getting that spot
bullshit spot
holy fuck those are some patriot favourable spots so far
we have to challenge that spot
horrible spot
look like he never even crossed the line
thats such a shitty spot
no way that was the spot
get the fuck outta here with that spot
lol why not
play mad d you just got robbed
fucking bullshit
torture
derek wolfe mvp
where the hell has this run d been
stop them on 1st give up 9 on 2nd rinse repeat
the fact that judon is one of our better defenders today is scary
this 3rd down is the biggest play of the game
stop them
someone needs to make a play we need someone to step up here to save this game and give us a chance
this is why you do not give up long runs on 2nd down made it all too easy for the refs to screw with us
scree draw
lets fucking go what a play
big stop
3rd 10 big truss
there we go
yes yes yes
lets gooooooo
ok lamar and hollywood you want the ball back here you go
lets fucking go d
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
21 games with a turnover right none tonight
keep letting lamar sling it hes getting into a rhythm
we need the wombo combo in action
d o b b i n s

7 minute drive running the ball down their throat make that missed pat hurt a little more
this game thread be like this is game cant win when behind etc etc one sec then big trussssss the next
lamar needs to simultaneously acknowledge this is his moment and also not let it affect him at all
milk clock score td win 2423
andrews whyyyyyyyyy
ffs andrews
fuck andrews
andrews showing his bricks off when it counts
i swear with this offense its like you blink and its 3rd down
wet balls
mark
why would they even consider putting ingram in when gus runs like that
never seen a team as lucky as pittsburgh
wtf lamar
get em llama 3
gotta hold that andrews ffs
lmao that was wack
lmao fine ill do it myself lamar
not the big moment mark andrews drop
dive for the knees more mcourtey you cunt
wow we are fucking ourselves surprise
bro the fucking snaps
skura stahp
andrews and drops in big moments against anyone not named the browns iconic duo
holy fuck skura
matt skura is ruining my life
how many bad snaps
we need to cut him hes killing us
fucking skura
if thats tom brady someone is kicked from the league
slippery balls
shift skura to guard put mekari in at center jesus
bet we throw it at least 5 yards short of the first down line
damn skura
skura need to be cut after this game
we have zero passing attack down field
im gonna go cry into some vodka defense please stop them
skura killed this drive
lmao skura gonna get more than just a cut on his hand
who in gods name was lamar even throwing to
thanks skura ya fucking dipshit
fuck skura man absolute trash

skura
gotta love skura giving the game away
every week its another massive unforced fuckup from someone on this team
please fucking bench skura motherfucker is single handedly costing us this game put in mekari not as good of a blocker but at least he can snap the goddamn ball jesus fuck
put cox in at this point
can cox do center too
pain
that mightve been a situation on 3rd and 15 to try and get 812 yards and set yourself up for a manageable 4th down
ive said it every game were down and ill keep saying it we need some i formation plays damn it
we need a gift here
we can still come back got enough time defense needs to hold em back
blame of the game skura
boy that was a pretty bad throw from lamar on 3rd and long tbh

they dropped 9 gotta buy more time and throw downfield
fuck skura
how does skura have a job its not a cut on his thumb its not the weather this has been an issue for a while
would love a rainy day fumble here
if this coaching staff doesnt look different starting next year and we dont get lamar any help at all i dont blame him if he doesnt want to resign
oh look queen just standing there letting them get the first down
lets line lamar up 8 yards back and put morgan cox in at c
still giving up long runs on 2nd and long
queen has a long way to go in coverage
heres a guy stfu
queen is braindead
what the fuck was queen doing on that play lmao
heres a guy drink
what the fuck peters shed the block
peters why are you standing there
well im off to watch lamar jackson 2019 mvp highlights goodnight men
and thats the game for real
wtf
defense fucking collapsed
that honestly helped
one more come on defense
we lose this we have the same record as the browns if we play like this next week we lose that game too things arent looking great
how have the penalties not been handled at this point we get overdouble the amount of penalties than our opponents terrible coaching
watch ne get 6 on 3rd and pick up the 4th down
if you could go back to the draft and reselect a player who would it be

2020 draft
its been a real theme for this team besides last year to play down to their opponents level
now that was a really dumb play call by the patriots
here we go
lamar has to be special here
well lamar heres your chance
gonna be holding
okay lamar
great penalty guys thats what we need
omg holding
well lamar

do your thing my man
yanda really haunting us pretty devastating
go hollywood show your speed
football gods said more rain
fuck these refs
like are you fucking serious the minute we get the fucking ball back this rain starts again like really what the fuck
even when theres a prayer of a chance theres really none because the line cannot not hold
imagine if we could just not take penalties on huge plays thatd be so awesome
mark cant even hustle to get out of bounds useless when it matters lmao
this team is running sprints this week
the fact it is raining harder here is a sign
hahahaha even the football gods are against us now
they gave us the ball with that much time because they know we cant do such a shame our o is not a threat
this is like the bad game on any given sunday
patriots are cheating they somehow managed to change the weather when we come out on offense
this game left a bad taste in my mouth hopefully we can at least beat the titans to get revenge on those fuckers
even the weather is against us
ravens might not even make the playoffs horrible team
that was such a pathetic performance by the team holy shit
did yannick play tonight
was dez active tonight why did we sign the guy if hes not going to play
they sniffed out that dobbins shovel pass every fucking time
anybody know how many yards were lost due to penalties this game
im so fucking pissed greg roman doesnt deserve a job who the fuck decides its time to get cute on 4th and 1 when youre down 10

worthless sack of shit deserves to lose his job and never get another

fuck him fuck him fuck him
on the one hand we just scored on a jet sweep to willie snead

on the other hand why are we running jet sweeps with willie snead
could you dumbfucks stop trying to strip the ball and actually tackle
thats why queen is so low on pff gents he cant cover to save his lifr
yup throw a jump ball to the midget whos double covered
justin tucker is the goat lamar is the mvp
am iliking this roman offense
suddenly gr a god this sub man this sub
if theres one thing i hate about the pats its their tiny fucking hobbit receivers that all look exactly like burkhead
i feel like humphrey hasnt been near the ball all daywe need a fruit punch
need to stack the box let marlo and marcus press 1v1 on the outside make cam beat us in the air
weve scored 10 points in this half against the one of the worst teams in football
we got this baltimore lets do this
patrick queen absolutely awful in coverage
lmfaooooo this is fucking pathetic
how is burkhead faster than queen and why do we always fall for that bullshit
lol tissue paper oline
any other time hollywood cant wait to get out of bounds but right here when we need him to he just falls to the ground
the one thing you cant do lamar
that was a dumb fuckin throw and yall still blame the receiver i really dont get it
i fucking have no words no fucking words
i feel dez woulda caught that
absolutely horrible decision by lamar no way around it you gotta take the 3 pts there going into half
this is going to be an uphill battle trying to stop the run without calais and big baby
i feel a big defensive score coming for us soon
everyone complaining about the offense but no one mentioning the defense they havent been able to stop the run at all
yeah were garbage
we are seriously losing to a 35 team

fuck trap games
so much negativity
this is further evidence that our d cannot continue to bail the offense out they are the only reason the steelers didnt stomp us and have made pivotal forced turnover plays all season

meanwhile lamar throws wild passes regresses in awareness our receivers are covered like flies on shit and we dont stick to the run fire greg roman
i have to be up at 5 see yall next week
wowowowow lets put in our worst rb and take out lamar wowoow
and theres your weekly judon fuckup
wouldnt he a ravens game without a dumb judon penalty
humphrey is hurt
why are we having a post superbowl championship collapse this team cant even spell sooperbuwl
stop counting the points
thats my mofo qb fuck you haters
that was a bad choice by lamar

not only was there nothing but green to his left but then the pass was poor just why man
any score and this is likely over need a turnover
i cant believe we didnt challenge that
what a stupid terrible fucking pass
ravens 100 have to cut skura right away when cundiff got the yips we held on too long and it fucked us this guys is a lost cause
i dont often say this during a game but matt skura legitimately needs to get cut
cut skura fire greg roman
this was a bad one
mother nature doesnt want us to have a chance
most pathetic ending to a game ive ever seen im fucking furious
literally couldnt have been more pathetic
fire dean pees
okay this needs to be said hollywood is not that good
everyone wants to cry about not having a wr but they were so against getting ab
the rest of our team dosent deserve lamar
justice hill once again providing great value to the ravens
henry is going to have another field day on us
no one was realistically thinking lamar would keep up his mvp level play from last season but my god he just looks not great
the jets could beat us right now
this is a 106 team guys
this team fucking sucks
can we please fire roman hes completely unable to innovate at this point
we werent who we thought we were
at least that att girl is hot
lamar threw that to mccourty wtf was that
cant wait for the post game thread where were told how great this team actually is and youre a fake fan for complaining about anything
they gave up on national tv
people saying refs bailout like our d wasnt shit and elliot isnt dumb
10 points so far against a team that the jets diced up fire gro today
flacco and the jets looked better against the pats then we did let that sink in teams toast
wait youre allowed to run the ball on the first drive someone tell gro
another week another set of pussy refs shocker
bs block in the back no call
generous spot
why did we escort him over the 1st down line tackle him dammit
come the fuck on
guys i cant believe this lamar jackson is giving up too many rush yards smh my head
just get off the field defense thats fucking shameful
that pass coverage by queen made me wanna jump off a cliff damn that was bad
wow for once im more concerned about the defense than the offense
this deshaun watson commercial is cringe
lamar and snead are basically the players of the game right now carrying the team
what an awful throw cant blame hollywood or roman for that
why would you make that throw wtf lamarthats on you
what a dumb fucking throw
hollywood supposed to be fast he is not fast he is not big what is he
how is that on hollywood he was never open lol and it was a short throw
jackson needs to learn to throw back shoulder throws
hollywood sure complains a lot for a trashcan wr
hollywood more like high school musical
you would think wed be down so much by looking at this sub right now lol
what thread was is worse last week at halftime or tonights
oline play isnt as good as it was last year part of the problem

lamar cant scramble because all eyes are on him all the time and defenders dont even hesitate to collapse part of the problem

i want lamar to be able to make it look like hes tucking and running only to pull back up and throw it after faking the d i feel like he needs better pocket awareness for that
idk why we are trying to make everyone play out of their specialties i get that you need practice in other areas but this year we are ignoring our proven strengths
yeah its game over you cant win a game when youre being gashed on the ground like this
literally fire people after this game idc who just fire someone act like anyone cares one bit someone has to answer for this shit even if its jim in accounting
trust the offense dont trust the defense yet where tf is yannick hes supposed to be our star well get it together
d line is too banged up to hang with these monsters on the pats o line secondary is thin as well

things will be better once we get healthy
fuck you skura

he needs to lose his job so many awful snaps in the last two weeks
im so done with roman holy fuck dudes
as soon as i saw belichick bitching without having any business doing so i knew that some bullshit would happen in his favor as is customary
we are an embarrassment were playing this team worse than the jets
where all my optimists at fucking crickets in here right now
judon and really stupid 15 yard penalties name a more comical duo
judon this guy is just an arse his nothing harbs needs to sort this egotistical twat out
not our year these injuries and all the other problems were facing i just dont see it
must have td here i trust the d to get one good series
yeah the defense is sucking right now but its like tou guys dont acknowledge that bwill calais fort and jimmy are out to name a few
friendly reminder hayden hurst died for this nice
how the fuck do you get calls like that its been several times this year that we lose plays to illegal formations roman has to go
skura blows
why the fuck is skura throwing a shoulder into the back of andrews head this man is a bigger liability than lamar throwing the ball
patriots never had a chance lets be real
im all for complaining but the fire roman shit needs to stop

lets just say we could find a better coordinator right now do you guys have any idea how difficult it would be to install a new system midway through the season impossible it would be impossible

this team has a ton of problems the play calling is occasionally one of them but its not why theyre struggling to win games every week
that drive was on lamar he needs to lead this team
that second down play was heading for hollywood not a great throw but probably a completion if snead doesnt go up for it
removed
kill these fucking idiot refs
cant even stop this bum burkhead
queen exposed hes a bust downvote me plz
queen and skura in a photo finish for blame of the game winner
this clock management is awful
now how will people be able to turn this on lamar
we really lost to the fuck patriots we fucking suck ass
that was such a blatant hold
this was like the definition of a trap game smh
ravens never deserved to win this game but the officiating at the end absolutely guaranteed that any hope of a comeback would be squashed
welp we lost boys i still love this team though lets get better next week
embarrassing
this team is a disgrace
season will be decided next week lol with titans steelers on a short week

even if we get to the playoffs since itll be via wild card route idk how far we can go with so many injuries so unlucky this year effing 2020
x200b

x200b

if lamar and the ravens cant beat the 35 patriots one has to wonder how theyre going to beat the titans next week and the 90 steelers
lmao if anyone blames lamar for this youre insane
queen is sorry as fuck out there tonight get your fucking head in the game dude
this play calling is ass and lamars decision making is ass hollywood constantly takes awful angles on the ball

this offense is such a damn embarrassment
crawl so hard university
this team aint it
walmart we know how to keep costs down

yea by using chinese slave labor
of course the refs are doing their best to make sure the patriots have any chance of winning as is tradition
keep pretending like everythings fine people
hollywood has been pretty bad this game
damn yall cant believe we just lost the game some of yall whine and complain like a bunch of babies yeah it was a bad decision move on hes been near flawless otherwise today
this fanbase is so divided in terms of attitude sad
here we go another come from behind win incoming
get ready for 2 straight losses henry is gonna go for 300 next week
the ravens spent all this money on defense but cant stop cam
andrews is making it a habit of disappearing or dropping passes in key games we have a serious choking and pussy attitude problem

i want some mean fucks who make big plays
throwaway season well be back next year
this is the worst coached team in football
realistically we should beat the breaks off the patriots but as always were going to struggle
lottery 420 we got this
i want to see a beat down tonight the likes of what wed dish out last year fuck the patriots
first regular season win in foxborough tonight boyz lets make it happen
enthusiastic caws
are you fucking kidding
jos voice gives me strength
i predict a dominating performance in which the ravens win 2714
let us progress in a forward motion
can you say 8 0 patriots sunday night again for the dumbass people who says lamar cant win big games
lets gooooooooooo
there will be some low passing yardage tonight
all white during a super rainy game nice lol
and herewego
okay oline
nice blocking
wish dobbins was starting
whens the last time we wore all white feels like forever
hollywood was open on that play
crazy seeing the stadium so empty
ravens legend john simon
leggooooo big trussss
womp
i always wonder what the deal with john simon was we gave up on him quickly and hes had a pretty decent career since
ugghh
bruh
hollywood is so small goddamn it
what was that hill
justice hill is dumb lol
ayyy i love queen
can we pls start giving it to duvernay more often
justice hill was held and couldnt even see the fair catch wave
why does cam look high in that pic lol
the refs are awful how could they call that fair catch interference game is rigged as usual s
clusterfuck
i mean just because youre blitzing doesnt mean you cant hit the ball carrier lol
run defense
no huddle interesting
nice d boys
harrison knocked that blocker back 5 yards lmao
malik blew that up
run defense
i have a feeling we will see a peters pick tn
harrison blew that mofo up
damn trucked by cam
i wish jaylon could set a fucking edge
harrison isnt going to let the coaches put fort back in
hey run d you can wake up now
ravens defense assemble
so we didnt see a qb draw coming there why tf was no one on the line
seems like the pats coaching staff realize if they want to win games they need to rely on the run game i wonder when ours will figure that out
nice to have marlon back
queen read that so well
that made up for being trucked lol
only pff could rank a top droy candidate as one of the worst linebackers in the game absolute joke
how can anyone take pff seriously when the number 1 defense only has one top 10 player
wow judon sighting pleasant surprise
dont cheer judon you know who you are
judon showed up tonight noice
102 of of 111 omg
welp
judon did something
at the end of the day i dont have to climb in bed with a woman from boston so tonight is a win win
judon chop
matthew judon
fuck not peters
judon finally did something
not marcud please not marcus
holy shit judon actually finished a sack
peters noooooo
body built by taco bell
how about we try running the ball this drive
not the juiceman
judon sighting
judon did something right
it doesnt look like a terrible injury
can they wipe the camera lens
can we get dobbins involved please
finally jk
need a first down here
holy shit was that a pistol formation
everything just seems soooooo much more difficult this year i will never understand it
i do like jk as our main but still like ingram always gets some little catches too hes definitely a piece we can use they just need to change it up
gus the bus
atleast this game will be over quick both teams will just run run and run some more
when edwards or dobbins are in the running game good things happen they need to be the cofeature backs
oh look at us throwing and catching
there we go willie
serious question are we having way more injuries than other teams it seems like were losing multiple players every game
steve needs a hair stylist
ljstunt on them hoes
duuuuuuuuuv
duv needs more touches
lmao collinsworth loves his patriots on sunday night fuckin pussy
great play call and pass to duvernay
duvvvvvvv
i like this
waaaay more misdirection so far this game i love it
duvernay nuff said
duuuuuv
great use of a screen with duvernay right there
man i get so nervous when lj runs with the ball like that
more screens with our quick receivers please
removed
dat boi fast
duv has that track speed
stunt on them hoes lamar
gus the bus
what kind of commercial was that
was that the ultimate warriors theme song
give it to dobbins damn
sneeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaddddddd

sneaddddddd td
keep this pace we gotta get an early lead cuz we never catch up when were down
sneads first td on the year
the snead sweep
need iv sneed
touchdown snead

legooooo
willie snead is mr reliable
sneady spin
thanks offense very cool
interesting to run that with snead instead of brown or duvernay
wooo sneeeaaad
wow finally something more creative
never in doubt for the xp
commentators have gotten self aware with the jinxing its over
watching that play i can confidently say that i am physically capable of making nfl caliber touchdown passes
lets get that 3 and out d
best drive since cleveland game
that drive was phenomenal and played exactly into the strengths of this offense
x200b

oj simpson
oj who hello twitter world its yours truly
blah
fuckin penalties
no xbox for you ever deshon
thats a flag
dont start this bs
god dammit lets not kill ourselves with dumb ass penalties again
oh come on
bullshit ass call
oh were going to give them yards now with bs ok
ptsd ptsd ptsd ptsd
i swear our defense has more yards on penalties than yards theyve actually given up in the season
so whos in on the cam newton jerk off party
damn the defense is getting fucking worked tonight
the patriots offense is doing surprisingly well against our defense
how many off that penalty tho
bruhhh cmon defense
that was a sucky sucky drive
real real bad by the defense good lord n
b will questionable to return fuck
so thats not a crack back block
wait thats not mayfields body
yea they called a pick play but it wouldnt have worked if elliot hadnt bit so hard on the inside run
they got to our 41 because of a bullshit call that drive was killed right there for our d
ravens injury update 98 dt brandon williams ankle questionable csteele32
brandon williams questionable to return oh boy dont let me down run d
dt brandon williams ankle is questionable to return ughhhh
this offense needs to dictate and not take whats given
this extra qb movement in the pocket is a waste of time every fucking time it never works
llama
speed demon
that play shows our receivers cant get open or the plays are so basic its so easy to read
i want the broadcast would show whats happening downfield on those scrambles
lamar more like a flight stick
fuck penalties
first doen lets go
big truss
glad they awarded that first down i wouldve been livid if they didnt
what a catch jfc
nice catch mark
bad spot but ill take it lmao
lmfao they pushed him to a first down
what the fuck is wrong with skura
less ingram please
andrews is the most handsome of that trio by far
gro i applaud your play calling tonight whatever youre doing its working
i think thats the first lamar checkdown ive ever seen
gus bus acting like dobbins doesnt exist
giantsrutgers fan here love me some gus bus lol
do the pats have no pass rush or is our line blocking really well
hey they got one of those penalties too
who ever doesnt think mark andrews isnt a top 3 te is a dumbass
i love gus dude is a mauler
well at least the refs are consistent with lowering the helmet
okay refs all is forgivenfor now
that would be targeting in college
he got a big body call him big body
100 here for gus in the passing game
at least theyre consistent but i disagree with both calls tbh
cam pull the mask up you dumb cunt
good you wanna ticky tack elliot you ticky tack the pats
when ricard doesnt drop the ball hes a problem in the open field lol
diabeetus big truss
alright fair enough refs
the play calls on offense looking very good rn
these streams are pissing me off
rare justice hill sighting
snead looked wide open on that bad throw to andrews
that was a weak holding call
we have lamar and we cant score in the end zone because of these playcalls
good drive even though the last few plays sucked
we really missed ronnie stanley out there that drive
goddammit thats frustrating thats the kind of thing that would never happen last year
chad masters in shambles lmao
uh thats some fucking bullshit
typical shitty new england weather rolling in
so were just not going to learn what worked last week against a weaker defense this week are we saving our fast tempo offense for the 2nd half we absolutely cannot afford to lose this game against a bad patriots team
need a three and out
oh no not williams
nobody can make a tackle
piss poor defense
absolutely zero pressure on cam fucking hell
so defense just cant finish today
real 2015 defense vibes rn
need to make that stop thats twice weve missed plays for losses
how do we not get him when he has no blockers and is 6 yds behind the line of scrimmage
jesus christ make a fucking tackle
you have to make the tackle fucking hell that was so so bad
dudeeee we so many people but not one of them made a tackle
this defense is soft as hell
lol harrison if youre going chip him back there then blow his ass up
we cannot defend a fucking screen to save our lives
our defense simply doesnt want to play tonight wtf
defense cannot get off the field missing tackles in third down left and right
no bwill and no calais and were getting gashed
defense needs to shape up or were going to throw this game away
who the he is 71 he big af but hes not moving much
come on please play tonight d
ooff getting run the fuck down
cant win a game when you give up 5 ypc wtf is going on
cm9n baltimore
wtf when did calais go ir i thought his calf thing was minor
this dl of ours is such poop i want good olbs again
time to dial up a blitz
without bwill and campbell we cant stop the run man
the hoodie is a genius for finding out weakness guys no one wouldve figured we are going to get pushed around up front when half our defensive front is injured
humphrey has been quiet tonight
im so grateful to the pace of this game the first half took like one hour
who else was called the human joy stick
run defense falling apart
paul giamatti looks different when hes not all blue
cam newton has the easiest job in the nfl rn hands down
we are making this offense look like a paul giamatti tv show when they are really a paul giamatti commercial
have mercy on us henry
i get were missing some key players but the forced turnovers really paper over a lot of holes on this d
how long is calais out dude just tweaked his calf he didnt sprain his knee or something like that
campbell and williams r clearly massive losses and nes run block is very good
this defense feels like death by papercuts rn
run d again the biggest weakness when can we pleeeeease have superstar olbs again
ive been muting commercials during football games for years now one of the most effective life changes lol
what the fuck was that shit
what the fuck
pathetic
boooooooooooo
pretty sad defensive effort
embarrassing
are you fucking kidding me
we drafted him for coverage lmao
bull
fuck me
fuck
i know im not watching what im watching
did that xp just get tipped
fuck the pats
that was just frustrating
big miss right there
pick cameron off
lets see what lamar can do with 62 seconds
legit garbage defense
seriously though why bother with a mask if youre just going to use it as a lower lip cover

at least hollywood didnt drop that
they are just abusing our tackles at the moment
let lamar fling this bitch please
this is a 2420 type game suck it up
does anyone track commercial time per game this is fucking absurd
lamar is playing great tho man pls defense lets do something
i think duv loves the commercials too
have we completed a pass in the air for over 20 yards i mean not including rac
if jt makes this im crying
welp
what the fuck yo
god fucking dammit
motherfucker
bad throw just take a the field goal
lol lamar making shit throws and costing points
fuck
fuck me lol
god fuckin damn it lamar
lmfao take the 3 points wtf
thats was a forced pass
bro wtfffff
cut fluker man he is a teddy bear on the line
hollywoods time to shine if theres one thing he can do its get out of bounds
belee dat
fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck
good job 15
fuck it lets just build our offensedefensearound setting up tucker for fgs i want to see an offense like this before i die
cmon man
well
how to take points off the board in one easy step what a huge disappointment this team has been tonight
there was no need to do that
ok marquise is souring on me a little his inside position skills are bad still a fan but were trending downwards
what is that why are we throwing there we had 3 points in the bag i hate that play call i hate hollywood not making a play on the ball
ughhhhhhhhhhhhh
can we make 2 game threads starting next week i want the old things back haha
dude just tried to force it to hollywood so he wouldnt bitch on twitter after the game
stop asking why he threw that because hollywood probably has been crying all week
what the fuck was that playcall jesus christ roman just take the check down for a first down and bring out tucker
my local nbc feed cut out right before that pick its like it was trying to save me from throwing the remote through the tv
when will this team shelf out money for receivers
i dont know why people are surprised we have a no1 receiver that should be in the slot
jc jackson is good and all but we drafted hollywood for speed right terrible throw by lamar but have we ever really seen hollywoods speed be properly utilized this season it feels like he hasnt had any legitimately explosive plays since week 1 unless im forgetting something
hollywood is not hopkins
seriously at this point i can only imagine giving lj a receiver like dhop he would have won that catch
harbs gonna be on twitter patrol tonight
the throw wasnt bad but throwing a jump ball to there best corner active rn to hollywood isnt good at all
im not surprised at all that this game is close but im baffled by this defensive performance and that last pick
anybody know why dez isnt active tonight
we need a wr bad
we were fucking spoiled last season and it shows in this thread

have you guys watched ravens games from 20152017

need some whitepills lots of pessimism
what did hollywood tweet that everyone is referencing
lol first play out of the half 13 yard run
elliott is struggling tonight
cant stop a run
the defense isnt even at the stadium lmao
defense is fucked
what is our defense doing
this is a joke right
right on schedule
i assume that the ravens will want to start getting things going on the ground the weather seems to be getting worse and our defense looks compromised no bwill or calais

pats ol is starting to control the game
what the fuckkkk
defense is blame of the game
what the hell is peters doing
im fucking about to turn this off
holy fuck they are melting down
we are in deep shit up the middle
not having a nose tackle is going to kill us here
defensegetafuckingstopchallenge
pats ol is dominating in the run game rn
give me a break
everythings fine right
that flag is nonsense and i approve the imprisonment of the ref
peters is either really good or awful
awful start again
humford makes the tackle
pain
man we are getting shredded what a joke
what the fuck was that
absolute butt blasting
someone fucking do something jesus fuck were literally playing worse than the jets
good job marcus you fucking dumbass
ok defense is going to lose the game for the ravens this time
i hope brandon will be good to go nxt wk
this aint cool wtf
appalling
late hit out of bounds more free yardage for the pats to give em a td love it
what the fuck is this season
glad the defense decided to show up
made it look easy were fucked tonight
embarrassing
we just got bilichecked
such bs
we going to show up now and answer

maybe
we need a td boys lets go
not good big baby out officially now whats the record when hes gone ellis and madubuike gona have to hold it down
carry us lamar
might be one of those seasonslike the eagles or san fran where half the team starts dropping like flies and theres nothing you can do
jesus 62 ypc thats unexcusable
brandon williams has been ruled out for the rest of the night injuries have decimated this unit ryanmink
at this rate we might have to put ricard back at dt
its amazing to me that this is exactly how our season ended last year
fort is out where have i been
incoming panic forcing lamar to throw for the rest of the game
i forgot who it was but who suggested that lj fort should sit this out i just want to talk
liam neeson release the dobbins
lbs not filling the gaps
guess everyone who has been clamoring for powers is gonna get a look now
if we score might as well just on side kick sorry defense
how long is calais out
why did we start 7 yards in the backfield on that run greg roman has actual brain damage
its all g if we have ingram in for passes and shit but plz use gus and dob more
even if we score here i have so little hope of stopping their run
literally need to fire strength and conditioning staff everyone is dying
run wildcat with ricard you cowards
how come we dont take shots down the middle with andres anymore
fuck i hate that call at least build in some misdirection
this feels like our last two playoff games we get blown out until the last 5 minutes and then we start playing football
gotta go for it or this game will get away from us going to hate the call arent we
fucking hell
lmao
why the fuck are you trying to get fancy
every crucial 3rd and short its always gonna be a qb run and the other team knows that
kill me now
time to turn this off
fuck off gro
lol
awesome
hahahaha fuck this im going to bed
christ
jesus
gg
bruh
lol what a fucking joke
of course
oh my god
goodnight
holy fuck that was a trash call
i have depression
why are we trying that cute shit in our own half down 10
wtf was that
we going to go for it and take the ball out of our playmakers hands sounds like a great idea
lmao bruh
what in the fucking fuck was that
greg
gro plz
lmaoooo
pain
omg
lmfao jesus someone kill me
that was embarrassing
what a stupid fucking play call seriously wildcat on 4th fucking down fuck you greg roman
weird you completely ignore an offense in your inoffseason acquisitions and it sucks as a result couldnt have called that one
i waited all week for this bullshit
goodnight yall i hope the boys pull it together
playing like bitches
how did our 3rd down efficiency regress so bad
fuck this
jesus fuck i feel like im being castrated
i dont like roman either but he didnt fuck that snap up lol
who has any hope that we stop them from scoring here
well sounds like i picked a bad time to tune in
i dont understand how this team is always completely different in every half last week 1st half trash 2nd half amazing this week its the opposite no consistency is going to kill this team
roman called a masterful 2nd drive he has been bleh since
ada boy skura we arent even losing this game because ne is better its because the same stupid little bullshit mistakes is still haunting this offense
that was fucking stupid
one fing yard and you snap it to a rb who hasnt played in almost a month six yards behind the line of scrimmage roman had been calling a great game to that point and he cant help but try to outsmart the pats
guys what if the ball was supposed to go to lamar and the snap was just that bad
im going long on rope at market open
why take the best player on the field out on 4th and 1
good teams dont run trick plays half way through the 3rd quarter down 10 on 4th and 1 in their own territory
when this team fucking sucks boy does it fucking suck
3 drives with ingram as the feature back punt int turnover from him fumbling

2 drives with gusjk as feature backs td fg

i love ingram as a person but he has dragged this team down this year he is horrendous
let lamar fucking cook fucking fire greg roman now
ravens looked like shit for the last several weeks even during the wins somethings up with the team as a whole and its not just the coaches
we need to clean house on 80 of our coaching staff
ingram coming back hasnt exactly been all that beneficial to the offense that wasnt his fault just a note
fuck you greg roman
fuck roman harbaugh enough defending this moron step the fuck up or shut that shit down this is straight bullshit now
ive like never even heard of damien harris and hes like fucking barry sanders out there
fuck greg roman but also remember to stay positive everyone
hey they only got 3 yds its a miracle
this is gonna be a blowout
jesus christ is cam cameron our offensive coordinator again or something
watching that blown wildcat play was the most painful moment of this season
queen sucks
i dont understand that playcall we only need inches to get the first
oh of course
lol what a fucking joke
judon continues his 15 yard penalty a game average
judon is so fucking useless
fuck

matthew

judon
look on the bright side guys there are 3 wild card teams now
this guy judon is good for one dumbass penalty a game i swear lol
about to be down 17
x200b

welp lamar is 16 when trailing at halftime

x200b

maybe he can pull a rabbit out of his hat and win this game
what the fuck judon i cant wait till you leave
nice hit judon
how many starters are we missing on d right now
jimmy smith
b williams
campbell
fort
tavon

who am i forgetting
judon has to be leading the league in defensive penalties right

judon is our best pass rusher lmaoo thats how you know its all pain
so glad we didnt extend judon
i think we have to start seriously questioning our coaching romans calls are insane nothing seems to change each week we are also incredibly undisciplined at some point its not just the refs screwing us
i cant wait for derrick henry next week
a 62 team will never get rid of their offensive coordinator unfortunately
watching the ravens this year is like watching a vid with the sound a second or two behind the picture nothing in sync and its so frustrating
oh thank god we held them to 3 or 0 if they miss
humphrey hurt
how is it possible to feel like this in a 2 possesion game
still a 2 score game if roman gets his head out of his ass we can come back
on the positive side still a 2 score game how we are gonna get back into this game however i have no idea
defense mustve been out drinking last night
if it wasnt raining i have no doubt thats a td

this team needs a td score and a stop right now or this game is good as done momentum is everything and that goal line stand hopefully broight a little back to us
im sure our offense will score convincingly on the next drive lol fuck you roman just let harbs call the plays
cam fucked that throw it was another wide open pat and they should had 7 instead of 3
fuck it lets go out and win a game 2 possessions
can they just forfeit and live to fight another day injuries piling up
marlon hurt apparently too
pretty sure this game thread might be the worst one for a while
that rain about to lock down this game
if lamar brings this shit back ill get to be really impressed
marlon was holding his bicep expecting some terrible injury with how this year is starting to look
omfg fuck this game man
fuck this year
holy fuck
wtf
fuck this game
fucking another injury
not boyle
fucking great another injury
another injury isnt that just fucking great
boyle just broke his leg
and boyle just broke his damn leg sob man
another injury how
that looked really bad live
another injury why the fuck not
oh no
what the fuck else could go wrong
and his knee andor leg is gone
this is getting to be really really difficult to watch
fuck that looked bad
bro are you serious
nick boyle just broke his leg
fk we wont have a team left
boyle out fuck
concede the rest of this game
noooooo fuck
omfg
fuck
fuck this stupid game man i hate this shit how many more gonna get hurt
fml
fuuuuuuuuck everything
jesus man these injuries are hunting the team this year prayers up for boyle
one of the worst injuries ive ever seen
i dont think ive seen this many injuries since the 2015 season
the seasons over too many injuries
this game is 2020 summed up
can we just end the season
wow how many injuries is that this game looking more and more like it just isnt our year hopefully boyle is alright
im starting to get worried that after all these injuries our super bowl hopes are dead
wish me had a hayden hurst
i finally feel the chargers pain
ravens are intensifying my sunday scaries x1000
we better sign like wilson and call up dez for the rest of the year
way too many injuries scary season
injury trash defense and terrible calls on offense this game aint even worth watching
well this is putting a big old fuck off damper on my sunday night
so is pat ricard our new te2
duvernay being great is one of the few positives from this season
literally the only good thing about this game is that duvernay has finally taken boykins job for now
duvernay is a baller
dirty fucking hit if thats not good against a qb it shouldnt be for anyone else
at the very least an acl tare that looked painful
its only getting worse for the ravens nick boyle carted off

x200b

only other active tight end is andrews
do it for boyle mark
were down and they run that play jesus move down the field
let me guess penalty on us

pathetic discipline
maybe we should have invested more in tes
what the fuck
i think we need to forfeit i cant see another injury
another illegal formation
we get called for one of those atleast once a game
holy shit we are just determined to fuck this whole thing up
god how the fuck do you let that happen multiple times a year illegal formation is such a clown ass penalty
harbaugh has to be held accountable how the fuck do they keep doing this
to be fair all of our line of scrimmage players are hurt
devin duvernay is our lord and savior
and theres the weekly illegal formation penalty fuck this team so hard
how do we have so many illegal formations every fucking week
we cant make a pass downfield without a flag
this game is garbage but this officiating is somehow worse
cant go a game without illegal formation does harbaugh even know the rules lol
yep lets just wait for the impending epic downpour to start our comeback
illegal formation call
lol gloves dont make a difference when the ball goes right through your arms
what
put me on suicide watch
4th down again
fuck you pats in no way is that an int
hes down

chill
he was down for sure
the pats practice in the rain gotta be the only team in the league to do that s
damn this game thread is slow as fuck tonight at updating
thats what we should have done on the last 4th down play
i can accept holds and pis and shit but these illegal formations the last few weeks are unacceptable
gus bus
fuck it im getting a gus jersey dude is the only one who consistently kills it

god bless the gus bus
gus always finds a hole he needs to get every 4th and short handoff
fuck you refs he had the first but gus got much more anyway
skura is so garbage omfg
gus is the man
this is just the perfect storm game for us to take an ass whipping sadly
he needs benched
jeez sakura whats going on
we still got time we just need a touchdown and a stop and its a new ball game
feed gus why does roman hate the gus bus
is crockett gilmore still availability
this is why we needed to score early

this weather is gonna be shit for throwing so all pats will need to do is clamp on the run this is gonna get ugly if we dont get a td right now
just fucking use gus
i mean whats the bigger liability at oline skura snapping or fluker at rt because we have to pick one
if lamar can come back he can shut up the haters
this rain is insane
ill take 50 year old matt birk over another skura snap
get skura off center
where is jk this offense looks so much better with him in the backfield
run the fucking ball
tf is skura doing
x200b

touchdown ravens

x200b

willie snead comes through
beautiful
need iv snead part deux
lets go
willieeeeee
does skura have the yips or something wtf
there we go baby
lets goo snead
fuck yeah impressive drive with all that rain
sneaded that
snead 1 reciever
lets go lamar fuck yes
how in the fuck are we doing this despite it all wow man this team transformed before our eyes i hope im not being premature
we need to resign willie snead hes our only reliable target rn
goddamn it would have been so much easier to turn this game off if they just didnt score
nice td but were going to need to be able to put together quicker drives and the defense needs to stop the fucking run
come on defense
lamar
woah its not all doom and gloom
wadaup people what the fuck is up huh

what a great throw
we still in this
fuck yeah offense is clicking relatively well
removed
can we go no huddle more often
i hope those who went to bed early are having a good night sleep
im telling you this is legit all lamar and gus this game everyone else is fucking up
nice pass protection there more of that please
wr1
beautiful fucking beautiful drive lamar is capable of the highest level of quarterbacking in the league but he has tot trim more of the fat out of his game beautiful
lamar hasnt been as inaccurate today
only down 1 score lets go
only chance we have is if the defense gets pissed cmon guys
dogs in the house bruh
i had visions of mp knocking that ball out and running it back when i saw him in the backfield immediately if only
come on lets go boys
espn commercial on nbc snf huh
get this 3 and out cant waste this chance
i just want a little bit of hope defense pls
for all things considering lamar is having a good game
rare judon appearance
omg a 3rd long watch a bullshit illegal contact
penalty time on 3rd and long watch
get this stop
please god get us a stop here
has the defense woken the fuck up
lets go
ok defense
lets go defense
pls
big fucking stop
yessir chuck
they are playing pissed off now lets get it
yes a 3andout stop by the defense
ummm did they just skip two plays for commercials
make them beat us with cam passing hes trash
fuck yes
give us that ball back lets get the lead back
come on guys lets do this
looking a lot better
danke dafr defense
2nd half team
lets go o keep it going
punt return team finally some action
i guess the nbc app is delayed from the cable feed and i was very relieved to get here and see people say huge stop great stop maybe theyve found a way to slow it down by crashing that left side
why is there no nfl logo on proches jersey
time for a soul crushing min drive eh
this bitch is ours so lets get it
i didnt know that the other team could punt the football i thought it was a myth
how will they break our hearts this time lol for real though
if lamar hits a homerun ball ill run into the rain and scream like a maniac

havent seen him do it in a long time
why is ingram getting touches
lamar needs to come out here and will this team its time to step up and become a verbal leader of this team own it be that leader this team needs truss
gus and jk averaging good ypc

nahhhh ingram
either gus or lamar no fucking ingram fuck
run mf
lamar getting his receivers killed
are you fucking shitting me
run the ball lamar
he shoulda run there
stupid fucking drive lol
punt it
ive coached girls lacrosse and field hockey on those turf fields in the rain slipping is going to be a big factor
the fact that gus only had 1 more carry than ingram is a firable offense
why throw it so fucking short
lamar is trying to get the rest of his targets murdered on live tv
d comes up huge and then we respond with this shit
hollywood is nonexistent
3rd and long and you throw to a receiver 2 yards out
where the hell is a wr besides snead
fucking go for it i dont give a fuck
willie too old for that shit
dont do your defense like that come on
i wouldve lost my shit if harbaugh chose to go for it
safety inc
safety incoming
ok atleast good field position safety please
so theyll be around the 4 yard line i seriously doubt they get a whole lot of yards on this drive hopefully we stop them quick and get good field position
that was a solid tackle lets sign that dude
if you are curved find out more
3 and out please
lets go d
pick 6 territory
queen mia
soft defense
lets goooo hell of a stop get this score lamar
stuffed
huge stop huge
judon got grabbed around the neck on that play
not a good spot
if they gave it to him challenge
lol 4th and 1inch thats bs
spot
what the fuck why do we keep getting fucking robbed in these games
queen is young and learning we need to give him time to develop its on harbaugh not having experience at the lb position tbh
lets get a fumble
bullshit
100 bullshit spot

mcphee cant let cam get outside there
get a turnover
pass defense is just letting guys run free
im sorry but thats dumb as shit
thank god the defense is back to normal i almost scheduled a check up after they actually got a stop last drive it sucks to see them suck but at least now i know im not having a stroke
i know theyre not going to let these dudes drive down the field from their endzone wake the fuck up defense
challenge it
stop them here boys
no dumb penalties guys
here we go heres the play
lamar study film
please force a fumble
huge fucking play please defense please
this is huge
there ya go d
cmon lamar this is your last chance
hey lets go
now that was a dope play
my fucking heart cant take this shit man
long drive with a td then a big stop would be nice
lamar if you have the space to run then run
they only got 1 timeout run the ball down their throat kill the clock score with under 2 min left
dont fuck this up roman

cmon mandrews
andrews what the fuck
man up god damn dude
swear to god im gonna have a brain aneurysm from these play calls
classic mark
the movesssss
what a roller coaster
wtf that was so fucking weird
god dang right at the numbers but also omg lamar hy shit
i love lamar
ball is wet af sigh
are you fucking kidding me man
cut skura please
skura sucks so much
throw the flag you stupid fuckers
that was a huge drop my andrews
nice route brown you lazy pile of shit
loose ball my ass
snap the ball matt
jesus christ lol
i miss 2019 matt skura
skura is so fucking terrible holy shit
miracle man lamar shades of 2019
skura wtf bro this is an all time bad game
bradys wouldve got that
dude skura needs to switch with mekari
cut skura
holy fuck skura
that was totally a late hit
another snap
how is that not a late hit fuck these refs
fuck you skura you bitch
theres the lamar stare down again and an almost pick
mccourty misses an easy pick and colinsworth talks about how good he is
dont know what more you can ask of a qb in this weather how is skura still snapping
at least we still have 3 tos
even if we win can we get a blame of the week for skura
skura needs to be fucking cut
lol maybe ill slide the ball to lamar this time thats a good trick
skura walks home
kids come quick that guy from the tug and rub is on zoom and wants to talk to us about mommydaddy the fuck
skura needs to get his shit together or sit on the bench he is hurting the team
plenty of time boys one more stop
need a turnover here
some of those play calls were cam cameronesq
sign mike flynn
thats game
can we already call skura the blame of the game
pick on queen when in doubt
patrick queen is just awful in coverage tonight
bro what is queen doing
were done
thats game good night yall
imma have to look at the data but i suspect the ravens record when they dont force a turnover is abysmal the last five years
a fumble would he massive
terrible by queen he was guarding grass
i am sad
did jacoby meyers play qb
always the scrappy asshole looking white guys that own us on the pats lol
queen just freezes in pass coverage
that was a horribly obvious holding on peters
lol brutal
season is cooked
lamar is playing wr on each snap but everyone is crying about the one throw that didnt even get picked off lol
queen was responsible for two dudes there it was a well designed play
good job refs
make the fucking tackle
sad noises intensify 2020 the year of pain
chuck come on g
fuck this
discipline discipline discipline
embarrassing night by the defense
here we go defense nows the time
the difference between a good and great team is one side of the ball being able to pick up slack for the other and the offense couldnt overcome the defenses mistakes tonight
defense just give lamar and co a chance plz thats all i ask
its not over stop here is plenty of time
this game is an aberration dont fret it too much

i dont think you can assume were not going to be able to snap the ball and its not going to be a typhoon in january

and this is the patriots they may have gotten off to a slow start this season but they didnt have full camp with their new qb they are better than the record imo
this is not the way
lotta people worried about the next two weeks tennessee ok sure with our injuries its a matchup problem but its not like the titans have looked good lately and pittsburgh is probably has a bigger gap between record and talent than any team in recent memory

ravens wont be favored in each but theyre winnable
a turnover here would be a miracle
if this isnt evidence that all it takes to beat this team is a run game and a halfway decent defense idk what is how many plays did the guys give away tonight again skura alone gave up at least 5 plays tonight
im not even worried about the l any more i just want blood for how they targeted my man boyle
please jesus give us a break for once
fire greg roman

ive seen too many throws on 1st and 10 in this fucking weather while youve got dobbins and gus fuck this
lol
christ refs let us play its fucking pouring
please no fucking holding smh
and holding
they call holding on us
boneheadedness almost certainly incoming
fucking hell
fumble on a snap incoming
this weather is a fucking joke
didnt even try to hide the holding
realllllllyyy omg every time we get some gain some penalty comes over and fucks us
down at half fire the streak back up baby
this is hilariously painful final drive worst weather
its done
lol 3 fucking yards you have to move down the fucking field jesus
i think what this season has shown us is how important having a regular training camp is for our players not only with the penalties but just player development and players rookies understanding the complexities of our offense and defense im not saying our season is over but man if we had a regular training camp this team would be playing so much better
throws it to fuckin snead on the outside with the 160 lb wide receiver as the blocker gtfo roman
anyone notice the rain picked up right when we got the ball
lamar will catch heat but he literally has no chance
gotta throw 3 yard passesgood thinking
wed need a miracle to win here but if we did win itd be legendary
andlightning delay
what are these fucking play calls lmfao eat shit greg roman you piece of trash
why the fuck is hollywood the lead blocker on a route designed for yac
welp
hahaha oh my god what a fucking embarrassment
what the fuck was that
yup of course thats how we end it
god damn
lost to the fucking patriots
yeah this fucking rain is not going to allow anything to happen
fuck this
whats a crappy night to be in new england
i dont see how they win against the titans and steelers with all these injuries
laughably bad performance wow
erase it from memory move on quickly is the best treatment as a fan
fuck that keepem out there and practice snapping those wet balls
i dont care how bad the patriots record is you cant make that many awful play calling mistakes and general play mistakes against bellicheck and win
run defense
matt skura
this team aint winning no damn super bowl man we dont have that juice anymore last year was our year man im just hoping for a playoff win there only chance is to get hot late in the season
hollywood is officially having the antonio brown effect on this team fucking wonderful
fuck this team
even as a steelers fan i wanted you guys to win vs the pats no matter if brady isnt there anymore sad to see you guys take a l vs the pats but i know in two weeks its gonna be a brawl like the first game

so have a nice day
1310 and people bitching like the game is over this is a football game an entertaining and close one criticism is one thing being whiny bitches and shit talking the team is just a shitty way to be a fan go find other teams bandwagoners youre not worth it
wow top defense my ass
hey guys just a friendly reminder that were only down by 3
hollywood is the definition of undersized you can have as much talent as you want but one thing is for certain he looks like a little boy playing a grown mans game not sure what they are feeding or arent feeding him but he needs a serious diet and lifting shift
worst 62 team ever
got downvoted to shit after saying this team will not win a playoff game this year during the steelers shit show shall we try again 2 weeks later
yall need to chill youre down by 3 not completely blown out youll come back

giants fan
75 yards ok

they got 15 after a bullshit call on hill and another 15 for bullshit on elliott
i came on here to see the overreactions i am satisfied
bed time fuck this
63 here we come this team is going nowhere
this sub is worse than the game honestly
cmon lamar its time to fucking clutch this game lets gooooooo
look the conditions are atrocious so some sympathy for skura having said that you cant make that damn mistake
that timeout on 3rd down looking even dumber now
we just gave up
checkdown joe is back
we look like retards how can we not stop this team
looked like a pretty slow and lazy route from hollywood there imo
hollywood couldnt accelerate past old ass mccourty cmon my soulja lol
no one gets open on our team
please fuck off with the refball
bill still has the refs in his pocket just have to get used to it i guess
theyre picking on elliot
was that kid amazed by a fingerprint reader in 2020
second fucking penalty on him
when lamar doesnt produce its all on roman

when hollywood doesnt produce he fucking sucks get him out of here
cams passing sucks the weather is terrible put more on the line
this defense hasnt been able to stop dedicated running teams for years they have a good secondary that feasts on teams having to play from behind but now that the offense is worse the run d gets exposed
wrap williams ankle in duck tape give him a cortisone shot and put him back in there
they definitely got that with forward progress
queens been pretty invisible
cam cant throw one guess they decided to let myers throw one
lmfao they always do this to the ravens every fucking time
worst drive by the defense all year
what is tony jefferson up to these days
fuck it i want points right now
the patriots are a good physical team with a number of key players out they are exploiting that shit happens flock were still in this one expect a lot of ball control from them the second half
wtf is going on in this thread we were having a good time then we get just 3 points behind and all of the sudden the season is over
god fucking damnit lamar
hollywood is fast with no route running
that throw was so fucking terrible and unnecessary hes once trying to do way too much and its costing us
if lamar tries to continue to feed browns little 59 ass the ball when he is either covered tight or had two defenders on him then he needs to be benched he tried that play earlier in the game and he was lucky it wasnt picked so of course when you try it the second time its gonna get picked
we were only up by 4 at the half last year and we were down in the 2012 div game at the half too like those games i have no doubt we taking this bitch
in the last 1 game we are 10 when trailing by three at the half
theyre going to run run run run run this half
yeah this ones pretty much over their run offense is just going to continue wearing down our run d its not like we are going to suddenly start stuffing the run game
national meltdown as per usual lol
i just recently moved to the uk i dont think im gonna make it because of the jet lag we got this boys stay strong ill see you tomorrow
ffs i might go to bed early
we need to fire roman our offense is better than this and he is hindering it
2nd and 4 and we call a run play that has dobbins start from 4 yards behind the los lolll greg you dumb fuck
we getting embarrassed in prinetime again
yeah im not staying up to watch these frauds
fucking skura
if harbaugh isnt standing there staring up at greg roman with fucking death in his eyes he deserves to be fired along side gregs fat ass
greg roman needs to be dropped out of a helicopter into an active volcano
greg roman taking the ball out of your playmakers hands delicious
ok lets take the dumb snap out of it why are you taking a fucking shotgun snap when you need a yard in your own territory on 4th im an optimist but that was overthinking it so much the play call came all the way around and slapped roman in the back of the fucking head
im actually humiliated right now
the way collinsworth pronounces judon pisses me off
how is that a foul
what happened to calais campbell
tbh im just always ready to blame judon maybe he was fine always mixed up in some shit tho
big rape is undefeated and were tied with baker fucking mayfield

wtf is this season
still a two possession game offense has got to come alive right here
i just want to punch a tv right now but i dont want to punch my tv im going to turn this shit off and go find a tv to punch
i love the ravens but theyll be lucky to make the playoffs
you know what its karma last season we had no injuries except for skura were getting our penance
hard to believe that in 2020 joe flacco is doing more damage against the pats than lamar
it feels like greg is up in the booth working from home watching youtube and just doing his job every 1015 minutes to be sure he doesnt get an away status on skypeteams
yannick has been a little underwhelming so far imo struggles against the run although missing campbell doesnt help
how is 85 not flagged for that that was worse than what judon got flagged for
biggest travesty covid has caused is the fact that there cant be fans at this game chanting bullshit to the refs
this ref clown meme
who the fuck was that too lamar
who the fuck where you throwing to lamar
skura has to go after this game he has been awful cut on this thumb or no also that 3rd down through to holleywood was awful and he was lucky it wasnt picked off
skura keeps making mistakes but the coaches arent adjusting team fail
fuck skura hate that fucker
peters was standing fucking upright checked the fuck out
the fact the peters hold wasnt called was disgusting
this is fucking embarrassing call the game this is a fringe playoff team

right where we want to be
this team has zero discipline
and now were tied with the fucking browns
this is not happening dont lie to yourselves


we might not even make the playoffs
patrick queen hasnt played as well this season as this sub thinks he has
lol yall need to calm down were down by 3 points not 20
chill yall we still in it
this season is a wash
theres a 0 chance we beat the steelers on thanksgiving
dude fuck all of you negative jack offs

the ravens will never be more than a good team

our defense sucks

fuck off like for real its the patriots and bill belichick anyone who though this was going to be a walk in the park is an idiot never underestimate the patriots even when they look like shit

this is still a manageable game
hey guys everything is fine right were all super dumb and doomers because of this right
im prepared to call hollywood a bust now
cant wait to fire roman

the game is not even over and doomer are already here wtf
so are we not allowed to say that this offense sucks and isnt very fun to watch
welp guys guess the games over seasons over no point in watching the rest of the games this year we all know the result right

youd think so if you spent time in this thread
i cant believe we got some people blaming hollywood there the mental gymnastics some of you go through is insane
thats game as far as im concerned this team cant play from behind or stop a run
need to stop giving ingram so many snaps
this season is over way too many injuries

we did a good job holding it together as long as we did
this team fucking sucks
refs keep being sold to the pats
a complete waste of a year the window is closing in once lamar gets his contract its mediocre city for the foreseeable future
the game isnt over lol you all need to chill
were going to get this conversion and were going to win this fucking game

kinda wouldnt care if brown gets traded eventually could maybe get a 2nd get your targets elsewhere
that crossbody throw to snead in a monsoon is a perfect example of how lamar has regressed hes so worried about becoming a quarterback that hes forcing plays he doesnt need to just run the ball man youre the best qb to ever do that its a torrential downpour just run it
did we just waste two draft picks on yannick
fucking embarrassing joke of a season
nothing you can do in this waterfall brutal conditions at the end
i said it last week and ill say it again we are not a super bowl contending team
no one wanted to sign ab everyone thought we could be contenders with hollywood as our best wr
boys its literally just a football game stop acting like the world is ending
this game is over this team is broken season is done wildcard loss best case scenario
yeah guys lets just tackle the guy fair catching it
doomers take the fun out of everything
cant blame greg roman for piss poor throws all year and hollywood not being able to fight for a pass or get open i get why the boys are frustrated but they gotta start stepping up
that is a bullshit flag lmao
done with this game embarrassing teams pathetic people can sit there and say look at our record blah blah this team isnt going anywhere
theres a lot of clowns in this fan group some of these comments in here talking like we were 010 and lamar is tony banks
refball
breaking news patriots cheating by controlling weather
never will i ever have high expectations for this team again theyre chokers through and through
dawg lmfao some of yall out here acting like we played dog shit trash its a competitive game in tough weather yall need to learn how to watch football games haha
are you ready to rumble
ugh dumb penalties already
please lets not have a sloppy penalty game tonight geez
man hollywood got pushed around with no effort hell of a soulja i guess
calling it now lamars gonna throw a pick and hes gonna start panicking and well lose momentum


hopefully im wrong
we won last week because roman learned that throwing the ball was a playcall he should try it again
oh cool weve got the female ref
7 minute drive i like that were in the red zone but damn were a must faster offense the patriots main corner is out we should be dominating them
the zebras are at it again
why tf is that even a penalty that wasnt helmet to helmet
where did they find this bonds guy he is awful
that throw to andrews uh
as much as id love to see more jk im happy they are giving ingram the ball we have so much more jk ahead of us lets enjoy the best hype man there is while we can
our defense truly is ass without campbell
who taught the pats how to wear masks
fuck this defense pathetic
great job queen got burnt by burkhead
pathetic effort
thats was queen if he just kept running and aint turn around he would have deflected the ball smfh
we win this easily if we have an actual wr1
good that he is wearing a chin diaper
unless offense finds their groove this game will come down to the wire
offense is trash
the ravens and a two minute drill name a better combo
are you fucking kidding me lamar
cmon man bad throw decision
we need more from hollywood i dont think that was on lamar good qbs take 5050s and that wasnt a bad decisions
bad read by lamar but why the hell did roman call that play
i trust wink to at least try and make an adjustment for the second half
if calais and bwill are both out long term we will seriously struggle against the run against the pats in the 2nd half the titans steelers and the browns all of those games could be losses luckily the rest of our schedule is extremely easy
fuckin jets handled the pats better than we are this is fucking infuriating what the hell happened to this team
queen is constantly out of position in these run plays
everyone playing like they dont want that covid asterisk near their superbowl win no effort
bro the ravens look like bikini bottom after a riot after that play my legggg
may be time to hop on over to reyebleach cause this game aint it chief
them mfs not even trying lmaoooooo
run defense nonexistent
if we play like this we arent making the playoffs
wow just wow i understand that was straight up horrible defensive series but just wow

did you guys really think being in the covid protocol for second week wouldnt show have you noticed we are missing bwilliams and campbell

first half wasnt nearly as bad as this sub made it out to be man im usually the pessimistic one
yep and now were trying to pass shocker
so ravens and browns will both be 63
how are you a dude who literslly got covid and still cant wear your mask over your nose
lmao see you guys next year
fuck this team lol
and that is the ravens season this year
cant blame the play call when the center cant snap the fucking ball
this team sucks shame that we wasted a draft pick on yannick
look like greg rushed into phase 3 of his routine running cute plays for no reason that dont work out
im turning this shit off this is fucking embarrassing
typical ravens getting embarrassed in primetime
thats some weak sauce right there
at this rate its looking like another first round exit incoming but i still have hope
att girl had to shut down her instagram or some shit at one point i think because of the simps
at this point pull lamar from this game
even the run scheme is so unoriginal pistol pistol pistol fucking scheme differently you fuck
how are they allowed to play games in this weather
fire greg roman plz
lmao snead drop
thats the fucking playcall roman fucking moron thats the playcall whenever its short stupid shithead
were not a bad weather team
the rise before the letdown
ugh i am not looking forward to watching this defense
yall are hilarious
we need dez
judon keep fooling everyone
ingram needs to just be official hype man and not an active rb anymore hes had it
go for this shit or we lose
ok im making snead my first jersey bout to drop that dc heat doing good
say what you want this game is on matt greasy finger skura what the fuck
roman and skura can both fuck right off to wherever the hell idc as long as its far away from here
bad snap may have cost us the game
patrick queen is garbage dont talk to me about tackles
shit on lamar for the first pick but hollywood was the only guy with a chance and underneath coverage got the ball it wasnt a horrible throw yall just mad no one else on the team can make plays
chuck you had one fucking job u dumbass
i swear the res are being payed wtf
now according to the media lamar got that holding
honestly nothing we could do in this weather it happens
lamar is fucking cursed lmao
anyone else feel like fighting someone lol
this team just doesnt give a fuck they honestly have no fire look like we cant wait for the game to end
why man why do we have to have primetime games i really rather never play on prime time ever again
unpopular take lj has been figured out adjust or expect the same

also unpopular weve already seen his ceiling
wtf was he doingwe just gave them 15yds dammit
so hollywood what exactly is he good at
not sure what queen was thinking there

he saw the dude squared up to throw and stopped run through it and play the ball

rookie stuff
guess who blew the coverage again worrying about his xbox
yall gotta relax
queen will come out with the lowest grade of any mlb in the nfl after this game you can book it rn
why are you guys so negative
of fucking course let make shit clear even though the weather is a factor we making the dogshit patriots look like brady patriots and were not sb contenders whatsoever
so many people blaming hollywood for that atrocious throw
i think hollywood will be fine but this team needed an aj brown type of reciever a big physical yac guy
future game predictions
week 11 andrews and peters get hurt
week 12 mcphee queen and duvernay hurt
week 13 ingram hurt again
week 14 dobbins edwards and hill hurt
week 15 humphreys hurt
week 16 whole oline gets hurt
week 17 everyone else on the team hurt
throw this fucking season in the trash as of right now id be surprised if we made the playoffs the fact that were so bad this year makes last years loss hurt 10000x more that was our shot and we blew it and we certainly will not have another one this year fuck this season
fuck the refs
removed
i still cant figure out wtf judon was thinking with that random push
fucking scum bag defender went right for the knee nut up and hit him high that pussy knew he couldnt win fair
fire roman i dont give a shit if we lose the rest of the season get that fucking piece of shit out of here
removed
lol i love that i got downvoted for saying plenty of time left
refs and skura have both been rough but yall really mad at this team already its not been a great game but seriously some people in this thread really showing as fairweather fans here
gotta give newton some credit for becoming a much smarter player
lol i fucking love getting embarrassed on primetime
every stfu damn
two more injuries this season is fucked
dirty fucking hit cant say im surprised
trading hurst never made a lick of sense at the time and its even worse now

the season was over when stanley went down but losing boyle cements it hes so much more important than people realize
this game is really a lose lose if we win its bad because we had difficulty winning against a bad team and we had more bad injuries

if we lose we wont hear the end of it from steelers and chiefs fans and the lamar hate will just keep building

i dont like being a negative fan but its hard to be positive about the season as a whole after this game
cam newton seriously should have a pinned post on rjustfuckmyshitup

im starting to hate this team lol
this season aint it cancel it due to covid thx
unreal bunch of pussy quitters
from what im seeing on twitter those bad snaps were due to lamar
defense playing shit offense playing shit we will not be winning this game and ive lost hope that we make the playoffs
lamar literally looks like he doesnt give a fuck anymore and its so concerning throwing shitty 5050 balls and smirking when they go off the field due to it throwing suicide passes what the fuck is next
ya know i wish harbs would come out in the press conference and say how embarrasing and unacceptable this game was top to bottom offense defense lamar play calling queen he wont because hes a genuinely good person and wants to pick everyone up and is loyal to a fault but fuck me this is embarrassing top to fucking bottom
stop making excuses these guys are paid professionals they must play and coach better if not they should leave
great one lamar how many games is that in a row with you giving away points due to a garbage turnover
wow we just gave up teams a fucking joke
honestly a lot of teams have random ass seasons and then do good in the playoffs were really not that bad if we get it together anything can happen only 3 losses
whos inactive for us
lets do this
caw caw
been waiting all day for this lets go boy
i think this game will be closer because of both defenses but we should take the dub reddit lets be chill tonight aight lol
lego pt 9
thanks jonny
wet af there running time
lets go boys flock time lamar gonna have a big game
i kinda dont want to see lamar run that much if the field is this wet
game time
lots of time
line held up really well
all day
real nice blocking
and no gilmore tonightplease let us take advantage
good swing route
all day to throw cot damn
nice protection from the o line there
did we just throw a screen pass
hollywood asking for the ball lol
that was the most obvious combo of routes ever
oh hai ingram
i hope the wet field doesnt hurt our run game
good start boys
solid start
friggin go ravens baby
oooo those jerseys are clean
sigh
should have gone outside
dumbass
lamar was better on that deep ball
some sweet play calling to start the game like usual
and so it begins
we need to get some better receivers fr man
2 pass plays on the first drive into a three and out isnt a good sign can we please just run it
daily reminder we dont have a good pass game so dont expect something different against belichick
alright lets go defense
surprised we started ingram in but glad hes looking healthy so far
hollywood wants the ball more but cant get open
surprised to see us take a deep shot no way was hollywood catching that though so it wasnt the best opportunity
wtf
i think ive seen like 5 penalties called against opposing teams when we play this year
so if youre getting held and cant see the fair catch signal you just have to know by telepathy

yikes
ill have you know ive only posted and commented in here 7 times since i said i wasnt hanging out here tonight
pls tackle k thx
every run going 8 yards lol
i dont like the run defense in this early going
no calais were getting bullied
pls stop run
pats are kill
not having campbell really hurts the run defense but sheesh i dont know why 34 of our offensive plays were passes can we establish the run its not like the patriots even have a good run defense lmao
its like they have pat ricard playing qb
jeez cam
cams thumping tonight
i fucking love madubuike
where were you when the pats showed us how to run the ball
hey gr see what the pats are doing running lets give it a go
tom brady all over again
legggoooo ravens
nice tackle by elliot
thats the deshon we know
this how we should be calling runs
cant wait until we can dump bwills contract
im still mad about the 3rd down play call
missing campbell right now
no way cam doesnt turn it over if he keeps passing
pff is kinda bs queen is a top 3 defensive rookie
nice play by elliot
matt judon did something
judon moves up to 101
wtf is with the pff rankings for judon and mcqueen
huge sack good stop d
judondid something good
juuuuuuuuud
baja blast
peters
oh god no not peters
x200b

marcus peters is hobbling off the field
judon

fucking hell
this secondary is fucked

nice judon
lucky not to get strip sacked
juuuuudon
how many fucking injuries is this team going to have
lets go judon

looks like he got kicked in the shin
better just be a shake up judon had a great speed rush there
i know yall heard that new edition playing tho
pain
let that go dude
chicken wars

ummno
john simon great pff rating
that was a pretty cool 3rd and 2 playcall
that was unfortunate but at least he was decisive in his decision to try to run
someone just called that in here lmao
also when max protect doesnt protect youre fucked
no one was open on that plan anyway
when they dropping 6 in zone and we only have 2 routes downfield i dont like our chances of completing a pass
they need to keep this pace and not get too crazy wear out the d and hit em
without a crowd the ambience makes it sound like the worlds most boring game lol
1std
lamar looking pretty good
snead
snead a true professional
if we ran gus every play we would get a first down every other play
i got a good feeling about this game tonight fellas
loving this yac
duv
wow when the ol blocks well up the middle the offense can operate
31 had a running start and still got burnt lol
our most creative play designs are always to duvernay
duuuuuvvvvvvv
duuuuuuuuuuuuvvvvvvvvv
i think thats the first wr screen weve run all season
great drive so far
damn love that play
turn up field and take a hit nice
can we not run needless speed option with our mvp qb on first and 10
youve heard of hair bands now hair teams between cam winnovich and lil bill

i love me some snead
lookin good flockgang
pitch to snead honestly didnt see that coming
what a play by snead he was dead to rights and just stretched it out
my faith is back boys
great drive i like the fastpaced start tonight
good offense when we favor running and mix on intermediate routes play to our strengths
cam and lamar i know cam never won a ring but its good company for lama to be in
i dont understand soccer teams at all like so many divisions or something wtf
that drive had some good play calling keep spreading the ball around
yeeaaaaaaa shit
hate that penalty what else can he do have to get low
i dont mind the call if they enforced it more
turnover incoming ball dont lie
milliner someone who sells hats
idk why but cam be reminding me of the persian king from 300
is tramon willams in
rain delay inbound
thats terrible defense on third down come on
come on run d lets get it together
already gave them 30 free yards
damien harris is a good player
fuck
what was that coverage
well fuck
swiss cheese
lol that was easy
brandon williams is hurt
lmao that was pathetic
bullshit
that was not a lockdown inning by the os pitching staff
jesus christ
thats such a pick
they gonna run all over us campbell is out and williams just got hurt
ughi could almost taste that block
wut
what is this ubereats commercial
now brandon williams is injures jesus christ
defense needs to pick it up
hey i know that song
dude just throw the fucking ball
running in the night is the song
need more discipline keep shooting ourselves in the foot
okay they gonna call that false start for us tho
i wish wed move with some urgency
between false starts and formation penalties our offense seems dumb as hell this year
he missed 2 games with an ankle
that was as close as it gets
can we stick to the run game pls
pretty favorable spot ill take it
ingrams cleats are so fucking nice damn
fluker is not smaller than obj maybe in paper but hes our biggest lineman
thanks cris for the insight on type i diabeteslike people with disabilities can t play sports
magic trick andrews
pushed into first down lol
nice play
quick passing and running the ball this is what we need to continue seeing
hollywood non existent so far
lmao andrews got yeetes
what is greg romans obsession with ingram
b u s
lamar cant read defenses guys
probably going to pick this one up edit or not
edwards fucking leveled him lol
gus bus staying on the move
yeah we better get that call too
kelce mandrews and kittle would be the ultimate fratbro house
sexy gus edwards
better play calling today for sure
finally a flag on them
that was obvious
beep beep
ricard is such a unit
man my stream is behind just got done with the mandrews catch
remember last year when everyone wanted to get rid of gus hmm
hey they called it on ne
dude gus just feels too fast too big am i crazy to think he could be our best back
lamar strong as hell for lifting up ricard
so much worse then elliots
hey we got a call
good call
hearing was that ricard groan when he got hit that honestly was brutal never heard that sound before
souljas
soulja
okay still seems like the refs are really quick on the penalties
block head ricard
the pats dont get flags you dont say
even when we get the same penalty we only get half the yards
thats assault brotha
ricard is a mountain of a man
this could turn into a long drive shootout
slant please
that was a dog shit designed play lamar had the momentum and inside line and instead we run him and the receiver that close together and make the receiver catch a ball and turn
its getting wet out there
damn lamar so close
fluker fucking us up
fuck it im going for it here i dont give a shit
leggooo
i think thats the first time hill has been in for two straight plays all year
has dez seen the field yet
the didnt even try cuz they knew tucker would make it lol
tf
this rain is making me nervous really hope it doesnt slow our run and cause injuries
we are holding with 6 lineman against 4 lol
this we sign tablet payton
this patriots offense is basically our 2018 offense with lamar short easy throws and a ridiculous amount of read options and run plays
i hate josh mcdaniels all these goddamn screens
come on
ngakoue walking weird or am i that drunk
need to rise up
learn to tackle ffs
just cant finish the job in the backfield tonight on defense need to close some of those out
i am liking harrison tho
theyre driving with ease on our d
goodness the tackling
so were not making a stop today
whiffin on so many plays
baltimore rise up cmon bb
im sorry but why the hell are they running through us like were paper
ellis whiffed so hard
defense is getting pushed around so far
this pats offense shouldnt be playing this well against our defense even with our injuries
did he say calais is on ir
boys need to spend more time in the weight room
defense played well vs the colts i wonder what happened
lol
do football pads cover the liver
2 minute warning already damn
what do you guys think of yannick since we got him
nice play by tramon
cmon guys dont let them gain ground
cant stop the run worth a damn
embarrassing defensive play but god damn the injury bug hit us hard you gotta wonder whether its just a lot of bad luck or if were not conditioning well enough
i think getting beat by dink and dunk might be the most frustrating way to get beat

we need help
i have a purple bed i really recommend
lol
wow
omg
bro what
wtf was that
wow
lol
they didnt even try to make those boxes look like they arent taped together
i didnt realize the eagles defense drove up to boston to play in snf
ahh or defense has disappeared
well
wow
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
arthur brown szn
pathetic
not a safety in sight fuck
sheesh bill wtf
welp okay
fuck
lmao no good
defense stinking out the joint
calais please come back to me
poor clock management wtf are you doing
lets go snead
in willie i trust
seriously i feel like you cod let any 2xxb guy stand there and not get to lamar so fast
lets go boys
why is brandon williams our again
bro the oline is so bad why the pats dont even have a good pass rush
bullshit
i see you lamar nice drive
do we ever go deep anymore
it really sucks watching kyler run all over teams every week knowing we struggle to find any consistency with a better overall core of players
lets get the ball in range of the goats leg
wow fucking awful
wow
fucking ridiculous thats inexcusable from lamar
i cant with all of nbcs trash closeup shots of peoples faces right up until the snap like goodness just show me the game
wow
ugh
nice
damnit
fuck
jesus pick it up guys wtf
he got greedy
ugly throw killer
fucking what is this game
that was a terrible decision he didnt even throw it over them
freaking windy and raining why even try that

bad decision shouldve just went for something short had a timeout
cmon dude
im not too worried we just need to bring more energy specifically on defense
idk why were taking the shot there but at least we look good on offense rn in some shit conditions
god damn this team man
serious question does lamar not want to be known as a running qb hes at his best when he has a pass play called and he just takes off so why the fuck arent we doing that its what makes this offense so hard to deal with
any word on brandon williams
id like to see a deep pass to duv one of these plays
im not sure how they can fix the run defense in the second half it seems to me that the ravens dline are just getting dominated man for man by a superior unit maybe if williams and campbell were playing it would be different but theyre not
x200b

here we go here we go ravens

x200b

get r done
what are current wr prospects for 2021 draft
elliots trash today
whole d got fooled there
absolutely embarrassing
judon always looks like he is smelling a giant pile of steaming kaka then again be probably is because that is exactly what this defense is
lol
bro someone tackle
lol
sad
remember when our run d was universally the best i member
this is bad
is williams back in
lol put all 11 guys in the box please
sothe fucker is obviously going to run stop it you morons
and a flag for peters fml
fucking come on d
harris overunder 240 rushing yards
lmfaoooooo
this defense is giving me a stomach ulcer
lol good lord we need a fumble bad
what is this defense
dumbass marcus peters
secondary is playing like ass peters has been getting targeted and of course hes going to start running his mouth now
and a flag are you fucking kidding mr
alright having broderick and justin ellis is pretty concerning ngl lol
lol we are so bad
absolutely 0 pressure
oh please with that flag

peters why
ellis is literally a waste of space
peters got boomed bad
too fucking easy
god dammit
this defense looks like youre crap tonight
defense didnt even try
holy shit team is garbage right now
wow
just give them the fucking touchdown defense is non existent right now
fantastic
bonds is down
soft
were not playing great please get it together before im drunk
this is hell

soft cant stop the run cant depend on peters to cover a jag i know the conditions suck bad but this is still poor effort
juan castillo for oc
wink please fix your boys up
so if we gets our dicks kicked in by a team that barely beat the jets then what are we bad
our defense is 100 better than this showing we need to have someone step up with a big play
this is the game our offense has to win it for us we cannot rely on defense tonight
i belee
of course mf new england
really need some points right here boys please
can we play some hurry up we need some pace

so they made adjustments on offense but not on defense interesting
run the ball on every down for the rest of the game
we lost fluker too or was he benched
hate the toss hate it
bwill status to out wont be back
you absolutely need to score here
gonna have to call a timeout
wheres gus going
i dont even want to watch this down
im calling it now dumbass read option inches short
go for it
got a break there
qb draw
terrel bonds is doubtful to return
man if feels like 2012 all over again all these injuries yet somehow still in the hunt for playoffs
bro please dont do this anymore
holy fuck
fuckkkkkkkkkkkkking hell skura
god fucking dammit
complete joke
lol
we lost gg
horrendous play call
who could have seen that play coming unbelievable how shitty our playcalling is
yep
hmm shitfuck
sorry sorry sorry

welp
are we allowed to mope yet
wrong time to try something cute
rip
man come the fuck on
bahaha
they score here its game over
bro we cant even snap the ball why are we in a wildcat so many questions
bro
playing like cowards
pure ass
qb sneak
just beautiful
being both a rockets and ravens fan isnt very fun right now
ok honestly what was the playcall anyways were we about to wildcat this with ingram what
may as well go to bed nowspare the agony
i want to barf
welp that sucked not looking good tonight boys
wake tf up
lmao
what the actual fuck was that im turning this shit off if we win great if we lose i dont care i cant watch anymore of this shit until roman is fucking out of here
fuck
i doubt we get a super high draft pick next season hut hopefully we can address some weaknesses and im hoping we fire roman even though he has had the ability to call good plays here and there this season
this play calling is terrible has that wildcat formation ever worked for us also that toss a few plays before was a horrible design


theyre using lamar like a rb
lawd
im begging our defense man
its game over
why was ingram back there
fuck the nbc jinx fuckers
ah yes 4th and one with the option of the best rushing qb in the nfl or wildcat
people keep blaming roman but this oline is a giant pile of shit
this team is on some bullshit
just set the fucking edge omg
fyi they may run it to the edge
man if the pats can run on us like this henry will feast those injuries
just give them the rush td defense
going to bed if i stay up my bp will probably go way up and ill have too much adrenaline to sleep hope we win but doubt it the way were playing nite fellas
what the actual fuck
seasons over with these injuries bruh
what can queen do exactly besides run fast
judon
zero run d zero might as well help them carry the ball to the end zone since yall cant tackle for shit
well see how much pride this d has but theyve got to be gassed
what happened to jimmy smith ive totally missed it
so frustrating with this team
judon back at it again
fucking judon what an asshole
greg wants to be fired so he can start interviewing for a hc job
judon is seriously 0 iq
there you go judon on schedule
i get half of our defense is out but that doesnt excuse the terrible play calling on offense
lol
our lbs are good at keeping the checkdown in front of them unfortunately its more like 12 yards in front of them
is judon getting a bonus for personal fouls this year
this is beginning to feel like a poor way to spend my night off
a flag on the play i wonder if its another roughing penalty on the defense oh look it is
lets just keep shooting ourselves in the foot
about time for the judon bonehead play
i gave judon credit earlier and i accept my stupidness
cant wait for garbage time stat padding
juuuuuuuuu doooooooooon
this game is gonna make me start drinking again
did collinsworth say jimmy smith is having the best year of all the cbs
pass the bleach please


i called this game 3 days ago dammit i knew it
whelp this game is effectively over even if lamar turns it up the defense cant stop anyone without campell and williams bonds and jimmy smith out too thats not really a effective starting unit in the nfl at all
were pretenders
looks like marlon is hurt
fuck marlon looked hurt
i cant remember the last time we held a team to a fg in the redzone but getting it here just barely keeps us in the game
man i was really hoping wed kick their ass atleast win the dang game
i just want some fucking points on this drive ffs
if ellis plays next week instead of campbell derrick henry will have 250 rushing yards
judon is so damn inconsistent one play hes making a great play to get a sack and the next hes taking a stupid penalty we deserve much more consistency on the edge than weve been getting from him or from anyone the last two years
i hate to say this hollywood brown is what tyreek hill is if he couldnt run routes

just speed
holy shit i thought i was starting to warm up to collinsworth after last season jokes on me i guess
yochill
omg
cool
boyle down
jesus fuck everyone on the team is gonna end up hurt
i fucking cant with this
and boyle done
is that a broken leg or ankle for boyle my god
just killed him with that checkdown
fucking hell
lamar just have boyle a hospital ball
jeez these injuries are too much to overcome
wow
jesus christ
oh that was nasty
ohhhhhh no
ffffffffffffffuck this season is going badly boyle down too
eff this game
fuck me
not boyle
jesus fucking christ
lets get another 3 and out guaranteed with minimal yardage fuck this timeline
jesus this cant get any worse
holy fuck
this pats team has turned into bernard pollard on us
fuck no

fuck taco bell
now the season is officially over shit boyle im sorry
fuckkkkkkkk just end the game boyle

fuuuuuuckkk
jesus this is a fucking bad game his ankle got fucked up
next year
fuck
how many injuries in one game my god
all i want is to draft next year is o lineman wrs and dbs
what a nightmare
fuck fuck fuck fuck
and our line just got worse

man this year could not have gone worse as humans and ravens fans 2021 is gonna be ugly cap wise too
the cart is out hope boyle gets a speedy recovery
people would lost their minds but really the rules should be every hit should be between the shoulders and knees
2015 flashbacks intensifiy
what happend to the pass offense l seriously cant hit any pass further than 15 yards this year
oh fuck boyle is done
fuck that looked gross
just end the game
jesus christ his leg
i hope boyle is okay that doesnt look good
no no no no no boyle no no no no
what you guys expect a third of our defense is injured i dont think this is indicative of anything
duverney needs more opportunities
its almost like the slant fucking works
jfc thatsnotgood
finally go downfield so you know theres gonna be a hold
we just cant fucking win tonight can we
cant excuse that
fuck that looked terrible
honestly fuck the refs im so done with these calls
fuck me whats this flag for

edit fuck us being so undisciplined
omffg
this fucking coaching man too like these penalties are absolute killers but fuck these refs
that was another almost suicide pass jesus christ
nflra is more corrupt than both political parties combined
probably gotta make that catch
catch the fucking ball jesus
down down down down down
lets get it man
need that first
oh so thats what happens when you run downfield
that was the first 4th down play where if lamar kept it hed be in the endzone
yes thank you gus
gonna need a td and some fucking defense for a chance
we have an offense like the houston rockets
is fluker hurt or we finally benched him
why dont we run gus up the middle more thats guaranteed 7 yards

especially when its pouring rain
no interior lineman on this team needs to be here next year
mekari is at rt
skura
skura
surprised the db didnt dive for andrews leg there
what happened to the hurry up offense
pain
why they take fluke out
please god make us win
fire skura
this is so ugly
i know we could not match that monster bucs contract but man i miss ryan jensen
whoever was watching every game this year the snaps were all shit since week 1 theyre way off not just tonight
i really really really dont know why we dont line up under center when the ball is this wet
need 6 here man
need iv snead
need iv snead

pls defense make a stop
daaaaaaammnnnnn

this is intense
see we run the ball more we do better

not exactly rocket science here gregory
need for snead iv
lets see the defense play with an edge next drive
lets go this isnt over
nice dot there
yall said it was over
need for snead
holy crap this drive is gonna kill me
yep thats our wr1
i just dont see how we can blame the rain for this
now the defense has to come up big
o shit willie
takeaway please
defense has had like half a quarter to regroup lets hope they dont shit the bed again
dime
snead is our wr1
time to watch our defense get bullied
ok so now we just sellout to the run
well staying outside fml
ok defense just needs to find a solution to harris and meyers and we can get things going
there we go now another
llamas bout to knock the 10 point deficit curse off his back
wtf happened to our defense
alright good 1st down
there we fucking go
lets gooo peters
any word on boyle
lets fucking go d
whats up with the snaps last week and kind of this week i know the weather sucks but it has been a trend recently
there we go where has this d been all game
good shit judon
please get the stop im begging
lets fekkin go
oh look at this we can play defense
what a fucking stop
okay thats our fucking stop boys
patriots choking
here we go
yesss
wait whats the person doing out there kicking the ball with his foot never seen this
did he say voldemorthaha
lets hope ricard can sort of fill in for boyle leaves us with no fb but its what we got
run it
do i believe now
wasnt roman your oc last year
ffs ingram
lets keep it simple not funky shit and take the lead lets fucking go
bruh
fuckkk
fuuuuuuck that was so close to a great play
nice try by willie but rough throw
shit lamar really needed to make that throw
leading with the head in a defenseless receiver
why are we throwing 5 yds when we need 12
dude why didnt he run it looked like he could have gotten the first
dammit cant get mad at that but thats a big missed throw
fuck it go for it lmao
go for it
let sam pass
third and long lets throw a 5 yard pass
come on harbs at least try for the offsides
fucking goddamnit just fucking go
they actually called him for holding this time
3 and out lets go
greg roman needs to go stand in the fucking rain to see for himself now well two straight pass plays are gonna go
this rain is unbelievable it looks almost unplayable for a game
drive was dead when they decided to run it on 1st down instead of play action pass tbh
decline no question
stop them please
malik harrison can not get manhandled by ryan izzo
idk
either way theyre going for this
pats just needed to lose that bum brady and they have a chance to beat us
this is fucking sad
wolfe finally showing up
this defense just killing us
whats with our coverage
defense getting super aggressive fearing a trick play soon
newton wont throw the ball more than 3 yards down the field
and that was it for the d 2 good plays lol
come on d just get lamar some good field position
ok d
now we need a nice drive
now thats a fucking stop
come on
backups taking names making plays
love these men
insert undertaker gif
offense better repay the defense here
some crazy shit about to go down and im not prepared its in the air today
ok lamar dont get in your head just play like you know how
the only one that can stop gus is our own guys
wheels on the gus go round and round
catch it mark
cmon mark
go ahead mark make a big deal about that one bud fucking choke artist
so fucking tired of andrews choking under the lights man
catch it
if lamar takes off an runs more he can single handedly win this game its like hes avoiding running at all costs this season due to the media cramming the narrative down his throat that hes a run first qb hes trying to prove people wrong more than he cares about winning
come on mark
would love a nice 7 minute td drive
one of our guys helmets goes flying down the field and no flag
we need smooth running keep the bus rolling play action give us a deep shot and for the love of god duverynay
hes so good
getting 7 yards a carry lets throw the fucking thing
run run run run
flashbacks to barry sanders
wtf mark
wtf
beautiful run and all but how tf did no one get open lol
fuck mark
just keep the power running going keep gus in there they cant tackle as well when this wet
lamar is houdini
what was that route tree doe
marquise brown on that play stopped once he dont get the ball nope im done
lol
vintage lamar type beat
really andrews
lamar jackson has wheels
i didnt think lamar would get that first down


im an idiot
lamar is so special also how tf does none of recievers get open after 10 seconds in the pocket
game
someone kill me
what kind of route tree is that
god dammit
that was the most pocket time ive seen in ages in the nfl
lol the pats look like a bunch of ducks waiting to get fed
receivers coach needs to be castrated
thanks mother nature
fire slurs this is ridiculous
skura go away
wtf
wellllll so much for that
jesus christ
fuqing skura
grats
skura get out
so about making morgan cox our center i think we could make it work
this center needs to be fucking fired
get skura off the damn field please
skura is wank
run runr run
how the fuck is that not a foul
we need an oline
wtf is that snap
jeez put mekari at center please
fucking skura
skura wtf
i hate skura so much yeah its wet out there but hes been fucking up for weeks
lamar working hard for it
defender wasnt going for the ball but ok
that really killed this drive
bench skura
son of a bitch
leading with the helmet
matt skura has to go
that was dangerous as fuck
fuck skura
thanks skura
great play by lamar i dont even know how he did not slip with all those cuts manreally another level


edit and then we have this shit by skura
feels like a 1st by penalty or nothing situation

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
thats the game

what was he seeing there
one more stop
fake punt
we got lucky that wasnt picked
we need fruit punch to get us a turn over
still might get one more shot at it
make it happen d
get skura the fuck off the field you suck
this seems early for a to
you dont call timeout until after the 3red down play yo
turnover pls
queen
how is burkhead so explosive
queen in coverage barf
fml
chris meyers personal dick sucker collinsworth
thats game fuck
the fuck was peters doing
fuck this
holding
pussy ass call
vikings cut pay elflein
lol man just lol
what the fuck was that matchup why is queen covering their only good wr fuck our coaching
fuck this game
turnover
marlon down too sick
the foul actually would have helped us i think
ugh what a shitty game not too confident about this team moving forward and its because of greg roman and injuries hopefully we can set it right lamar looked better tonight tho despite these conditions
penalty would have actually helped us
easy first here
not sure who missed the tackle in the backfield there but thats a play you need to make
idiot

lol
lol of course this shit to end it
discipline is shit too
gtfo
im sorry what

make it happen
gotta blame it on something
heres the game
this is not the year need to get everyone healthy and beef up areas of need
my daddy is not here to save me
what the fuck was that play call
here we go
lets hope for a miracle
holding by a mile
i feel like wink schemed a bit more 2nd half and figured out how to stop the run and give us a chance i honestly didnt know if we could do that this game
holdingggggg wwtffff
hollywood to the house lets see it
stunt on these hoes lamar
please be holding on skura
lol
typical
aaaaaaaand its done
pick bad snap recovered by ne or lamar scrambles and goes down in bounds to end the game
honestly these calls are getting fucking ridiculous
we are beating ourselves and thats the most frustrating part
here we go again
and another bad snap
we believe
lol they call penalties one way
here we go with the holding
holy fuck its wet
raining so hard it looks black and white
he was out of bounds wtf

good play call roman you fucking idiot
nfl refs are the biggest cocksuckers on the planet scum of the earth
fuck man

this team playing like they know theyve lost theres no fight
im absolutely sick of this offense get lamar weapons and bring in competent play calling
itll only take one slip from a db to win
dip and dunk the ball in bounds down the field
wow
lamar is pissed
every fucking time
wild game sad
cant catch
guess we thought we could sit our 2 best d lineman and be fine
well when it rains i guess it pours
shoulda picked up ab
this games over
can calais get a shot in his leg and get in the fucking game not sure we can afford to take 24 games off for a minor ass injury
id be surprised if we get a wildcard spot we legit dont deserve it
lol at the pats queers dming me that cam is better than lamar
i was high on hollywood when we drafted him but hes been making it tough to root for him
yall are toxic
yall hate this team then just go to bed
queen is soft af getting blocked by a rb like that is pathetic
just put rg3 inno need to risk lamar this game is a wash
queen is garbage downvote me all you want he does nothing
who else despises justice hill on the field
honestly that was good defense by queen
we look like shit playing brady and the pats oh wait thats how bad we look
this team is a fucking disgrace
fuck this team they face a little adversity and everyone starts bitching
dirty ass team
fuck the pats hope they suffer endless injuries after the dirty shit they just pulled
ball hit snead in both his hands make the catch lol
roman is on the hot seat right guys

if we are winning a super bowl we cant do this shit
im one lackluster drive away from joining the gro needs to go campaign
that was a bad throw lol it worked but damn
hollywood is no number one
queens been abysmal against the run now gets dunked on in pass coverage
playing terribly since the touchdown
two fucking plays and you burned 29 seconds holy shit what fucking horrible clock management brought on by garbage play calling
just tell me the games over im done
can we please get dez in the game and scream in lamars face for that bullshit while were at it
fire roman cut fluker cut bonds teach hollywood how to route run make dez a starter at this point
our wrs literally cant make a tough or contested catch at all lamar cant trust any of them
obvious hold on the throw soft call on peters fun playing ne refs defense getting destroyed like out humphry on their 1 wr and stop the fucking run
and thats game
lmao see ya next week boys
that retarded look on judons face is him seeing his money fade away
nick boyle just got hurt now we just need ricard to get hurt and we really get going offensively
so these cheating bastards are just gonna injure everyone fantastic
its worth noting that injuries are a coaching issue just like everything else accidents happen but a statistically aberrant season points to issues with conditioning and strength training and playot safe
if proche drops this ill delete my account

edit phew
that was a good commercial but still fuck amazon
i wanna have hope but we almost never get these close games
queen needs to sit the rest of the season
all i can do is laugh im not even disappointed anymore
a pass for no gain hahahahahahaha seriously
gg boys onto next year
pats just allowed to taught huh
this team stinks
this team is not a good team so many of us have said it from early in this season met with nothing but youre a bandwagoner fake fan big truzz those of us that know the sport knew this team lacks what is needed tonight shows it again injuries suck it played a huge factor but it was a shitshow of a performance deserve the l here
literally just forfeit the next two games get healthy and pray to god greg roman is fried
guys downvote me all you want but just about every thing with this team needs changed coaching conditioning coordinators next year is it all we got before it will be impossible to win anything cause of money cap we need replacements for half of our offensive spots and half defensive even healthy that is not happening quite literally it is a miracle that we make the playoffs this year and next year
ravens will limp into the playoffs as a 5 or 6 seed and lose round 1
queen is looking more and more incompetent every game
damn cam fell off a fucking cliff since 2015
btw guys if you ever say duvernays name out loud its duvernay not duvernay like a lot of the nfl commentators have been saying recently
beautiful pass but thats not a route for hollywood
smh hill
brown could not have been less open crappy start against the second worst defense in the league
wtf was that tackle jfc its the first st play and already a flag
people who wanted outside of the numbers

there you go
lmao patriots oline bodying the ravens defense already
102 of 111

judon is absoulte trash
yannick has been a disappointment thus far
boys we got ourselves a drive
that was not a good play there tho they could not tackle him
bullshit how was that a penalty
god dammit this is where we get sloppy and fall behind
we are passing every time ingram is in the game it seems
i hope if it comes to 4th down we go for it
not sure why people hate on collinsworth i think hes a very good commentator
not sure why youre celebrating there queen you literally let him carry you ten yards for a first down
whats up with these soft ass defenders weve got this year re injuries we have like 23 that tweakinjure shit every week
baltimore no run d i arent think that
fucking embarassing oh well i hope wink makes some adjustments at halftime
are you fu hu hucking kidding me
i hate when we are just a highlight tape for offenses
defense needs to do a lot more in the next half
bro this oline needs help
offense isnt the problem right now its the run defense
whens the last successful 2 minute drill weve actually ran
seriously kill me
lamar piss me off man just get 3 why throw to a small receiver in double coverage
james urban needs to come in clutch
were a second half team guys lfg
we want to trade and target every position besides wr
defense going to start the 2nd half with a turnover make up for the weak first half boys
deshon elliott is still a liability
this defense is garbage
why are we so fucking bad
oh man thats the fucking ravens for ya

edit were making the 35 patriots looking like a playoff caliber team thats so raven

edit 2 i suck at english when my team is playing like the fucking browns
man i want to throw uplol
this team constantly makes me wanna vomit the pats are an ass team why are we always playing down
so tired of the theres always next year mentality cat just throw this all away put into some fucking effort
wasting a 2nd half to fucking awful
if we dont get this it could be gg
hahaha
on to the next one
skura is fucking horrible
if someone isnt fired after this game biscotti needs to fly down on his yacht and show harbs the light
defense needs to step up
this year we really look like what we are a young inexperienced team
roman gonna get another pass from the team because d sucked
if skura is hurt or whatever with this cut on his hand why the fuck dont we kick mekari as center and move skura its not like anyone on the line is playing to their strength anyways
we not out of this game yet cam newton has lost quite a bit of talent if we can stop him were still in this its only the 3rd quarter tell roman to get his head out of his ass
welp back to demons souls
season over
honestly it should be his last season with us i dont really trust skura man has been cut and waived numerous time we must have a crush on him or something
fuck matt judon
so this game is over and if our run defense doesnt change before next week well lose to the titans and then the steelers were looking at a very real possibility of being out of the playoff picture by thanksgiving
holy fuck can we please get rid of judon now
weve definitely been dependent on turnovers lets get some
yeah they werent going to let us win this anyway
we arent winning anything this year just clean house and get ready for making an actual run
our team def came in cocky and thought the game was one before it started were in autopilot and taking dumb penalties and giving no effort bc were the more talented team
fuck this game
noooooooooooo i cant my team is in shambles and getting embarrassed in prime time
well id figure at this point every possession is 4 downs now
patriots need to be investigated for bounty gate pt2
i was gonna go to bed if they didnt score now i am obliged to stay up and watch this shitshow
lamar is great
are you guys ready to get run on again
will the streak end tonight
honest question can this game be delayed a bit the rain looking kinda intense and i think someone said its gonna get worse
this one is over if we cant get a stop here
manure chant incoming
gg
lamar is putting us on his back and the defense is choking
welp fuck
3rd and 10 gonna give up 11
gg
these refs have fucked us so badly 100 hit to the head of our qb
wtf was that lamar
skura is such a simp
game over
alright patrick queen kinda stinks
fuck skura
lol
no collinsworth bill made john his bitch today with our roster this performance is unacceptable
why are we the only team in the league that gets offensive holdings calls
and our 20 point game streak broken
we get the worst timed penalties ever
we just have to get to midfield and heave one up for hopkins oh wait
lol they laughed at us
that was shit lamarjfc
is this a lamar problem or a surrounding cast problem
i said i was done but wtf why are we doing short ass throws a dforcing lamar to try and save the game fucking embarissing to rep this team this year
we get some of the worse calls from the refs

holy fuck i just saw ngakoues name in that replay they finally let him play oh whats that hes been in for a few games now how is that possible oh he hasnt done a god damn thing to shreds you say
im gonna say it we shouldnt have cut thomas

edit we should sign jefferson too
go fuck yourself if you think this team is winning a super bowl
its never lamars fault is rravens slogan
lamar is now throwing his guys into career ending injuries
anyone in here complaining can fucking leave and take your bullshit negativity with you
hahaahah this is worst than flacco
is anyone really entertained by the super flamboyant yahoo in all these commercials
imagine watching superstore


lamar is looking worse and worse by the week
durrr so many bandwagon fans chill out greg romans got this

wowdefense getting exposed tonight
hollywood more like bollywood run better routes and you can get the ball not this piss poor shit or getting a catch and stopping get some yac
so guys do you think hogans gonna shut shit down again soon store already getting a little bare on tp again down on the shore today
patriots need to be investigated for bounty gate pt2
hahahaha we cant even snap the ball correctly
pathetic team pathetic loss pathetic players bunch of pussies
anyone who actually thinks lamar has the clutch ability to come back rn is delusional lmao hes a lot of things but clutch isnt one of them



edit your delusions only make me more right
all you gotta dois run it a few yards and take a sure 3 pointsand you throw deep to a receiver who cant separate what the actual fuck i fucking cant with this team this game is over mark it
could of have dez and ab if decosta wanted
bs flag peters was already in the motion of tackling before they went out of bounds
steelers fan how the hell is that a 15 yard penalty
madden curse regression whatever u wanna call it most likely another 1st round exit
unbelievable how cute cam is id stroke him
justice hill is a terrible gunner
these stupid mistakes we keep making 3 weeks in a row god damn man does harbaugh not talk to these guys about mistakes
has baker been lifting weights
no reason this shouldnt be a blowout
bout to turn on the ps5 if our d continues not to have any interest
ha
holy fuck roman is actually retarded
lets see what the apologists say now lmfao
what an absolutely garbage throw dude looks like a straight rookie out there
he didnt even fight for it lol
just run the ball dammit
how many ints has lamar had under 2 minutes over the last 2 years gotta be at least 3 cant fucking believe we arent just playing to tie at half
is he trying to prove something this year or something run run run quit trying to throw you cant fucking throw do what you do
this team sucks
im going to fucking kill myself
moments like these i really wish i wasnt a football fan
4th and 1 they getting stopped calling it now
plenty of time left
as i said before its not only the playcall its a lack of focus and execution
im out on this game possibly the season see you sad sacks next week
typical gdt its a two possession game the sky is falling fire everyone turning the game off etc its early
i might break my tv
classic ref ball
say it with me yall

r
it wouldnt matter if they were short they wouldve converted on 4th
this team is trash
andrews is overated af
lamar
lamar isnt getting help but he is not helping himself he consistently throws passes i cant even begin to think of an excuse for
matt skura lost us this game
belee
im not putting a ton of stock in this game lose our top two guys in run defense killed us but like were also playing in super tough conditions against a wellcoached and schemed team relax if we end up at 63 thats fine
fuck this team not this year maybe next
smhi cant believe the ravens lost
bring on 65
defense fucking sucks
hey does anyone wanna sign my petition to get judon to play in traffic
queen looking soft and stupid out there
yeah great fucking idea dipshit give it to our shitty old injured rb coming back for the first time in weeks instead of the reigning mv fucking p

x200b

holy shit how embarrassing to be a fan of this team
removed
everything about the ravens is overrated
pats fan here really hope boyle is ok looks like an acl tear

we suck


how big of a take to saylamar may not be the franchise qb we thought due to not being able to pass
hes so bad at deep throws it just amazes me sometimes
fucking lamar
lamar is a bottom ten qb lmao what a joke
i dont care judon still sucks
our d looking so bad i know some starters are out but damn youd think wed have a backup plan
lmao a wr took a better deep shot on a trick play then our qb can
queen garbage
suicide pass from lamar holy fuck lamar knows it too
learned that from tj watt fucking dirty cunts
boyle is now out for the season with a broken fucking femur jesus christ
peters aint even trying there lmfao
lamar or hollywood are the only guys that can break something it has to be in their hands
mark andrewd fucking sucks get out of bounde you have one job
these ravens will never be more than just a good team
yet another unbelievably bad throw from lamar i am officially scared when the ball leaves his hands its a huge problem
that was on lamar
yo yall need to remember that this defense carried us for basically the last 5 weeks lol

its time to see what this offense that seems to be clicking tonight can really do
fuck the patriotsdirty fucks

edit lurking pats fans downvoting kys
i hope we lose so that we can get rid of greg roman he is such dogshit

lamar cant throw we all knew that
is lamar not good at getting receivers the ball or are the receivers we have just not very good at getting open i honestly cant tell maybe its both
need better wrs its obvious
thats bullshit he didnt even fall over
we should look into getting a qb that is a threat with his legs
derrick henry might destroy us again next week ngl
damn patrick queen 80 out of 86 ouch

also judon is trash lmao
ouch
i didnt really see much difference in playcalling seems more like weak pats d but ill take it
clear pick
how is this a tie game jfc
penaltiiiieees
so many penalties already
jackson puts himself in harmful positions hes built tough but im not sure its a good idea
pats anemic pass rush sure isnt looking too bad tonight
hopefully they sprinkled some deer antler on brandons ankle
worst defense ive seen in years
drink
if a non qb player throws the ball can there still be a roughing the passer call what if it was just a lateral
yo what is this laundry commercial
lol
oof
we suck goddamn
duv wouldve made that catch
why did we even go for a deep shot we were close to field goal range
i dont watch much college football id love another solid ol but can anyone give me insight on some good wr prospects we need a 1
gg
miami and jets looking better than us aint that a bitch
is there any healthy player left
its literally cause our 2 d line run stoppers are outchill out of course our defense is gonna be shit if the people paid to stop the run are out
ffs if the weather wasnt so bad we could take better advantage of gilmore out
yeah thats game boys
what the fuck roman
that may be it boys
whew
chill were ten down lmao calm tf down
honestly just pack it in and rest lamar at this point we dont have it tonight and we dont need a torn acl
dj khalid also handling stupid penalty duties

and another one
goodnight everyone
judon wtf

who the fuck are the interior lineman they suck and keep getting moved off the ball
eff this game
wonderful
bruh that looked kinda like the injury to the steelers dude that had the back injury he rolled on his back and was making those same hand movements
why we trade hurst again god dammit we had one of the best offenses of all time and you fucked with it decosta has been great and i love dobbins but was never a fan of that trade
lamar flacco check down jackson
these refs fucking suck
horrible spot
skura hand is cut we dont have a backup center because mecari is at guard correct aka were fucked
there we go we are only good when we are losing this wont work in a playoff game
yall need to breath this is ball so hard university we build men on this team this team needs the adversity they need to learn how to fight in the trenches this is what builds championship caliber teams
ingram really hasnt performed for us well this season
poor choice lamar that was almost a first god man

fire greg roman stat
queen just got manhandled
fart poop dook
greg roman needs to be woken the fuck up
grounding
he jumped into his fucking head are you kidding me
cut skura immediately
cmon now that was just poor execution papa harbaugh gotta be a little tougher this is professional football
fucking shit thats it
dude skura needs to go im sorry
skura ruining this game man
should not be giving up that many yards on that play
late hit of course
should have taken higgins over queen
so what should this team do for next year
fuck the refs fuck sukra fuck greg roman
good call
the ravens suck its official

removed
newton is washed up he aint half the man he used to me
hi my nama borat i likea you i like sex
turns out were big phonies

edit lmao at all the down votes i still stand by what i said i love this team but weve lost to the only two good teams we played we had no business losing to the steelers after the start we had the chiefs game goes as always yes we have injuries but so does every team
how much fun clearly not a lot of fun or he would have come up with some better plays just because we had a nice drive there im not going to say its all okay now
im so mad right now
best wr is 52good job edc
i hope edc trades up in the draft and we can pick up a wr
this is gonna be al long night
go for it you pussies
i dont wish injury on anyone but i wouldnt be mad if harris didnt come back
lol what a trash team
lamar continues to make god awful decisions over and over again and yall optimists are smoking dick this is a fucking bum ass team rn and yall are fucking wrong
fluker is so bad
andrews out for season now

edit was boyle my bad
id like to take a moment to laugh at all the fucking idiots that tried to say us being 62 or whatever meant we were a playoff contending football team
queen is still incompetent in coverage dont reply and say hes only a rookie its the mid way point and hes continually picked on
queen should become associated with the bench after that effort
shit lamar learn how to dump it off getting beat up


edit downvote if you want but he regularly ignores checkdowns
im ready to trade hollywood
new england looked like a playoff team tonight if newton can continue to play in a disciplined fashion they will make the playoffs
somethin goin on behind the scenes 100 62 yet sideline nothing like last year lamar sitting on bench by himself with his helmet on etc
bonds hurt thank goodness maybe hell be benched
fuck the cheating patriots hope they suffer endless injuries
holy shit lamar is pathetic no urgency in this final drive
i hate this team i hate this teami hate this teami hate this teami hate this teami hate this teami hate this teami hate this team

yall still dickride brown even when he catches the ball shit is sad lmao
bench queen hes useless wheres my boy fort

do you think dobbins gets a reduction because of the rain he has had fumble issues
ive always hated cam tbh
make up call
tom who
told yall our passing offense is bad but im the fake fan
that jc jackson guy is good probably one of the best db right now
lol
game over
skura is dogshit
boyle now omg
soooooo weve abandoned the run again

cool cool cool

fuck gro

another bad choice from lamar come on bro

lamar has never won a big game in his whole career
you guys are 15 seconds ahead of my illegal stream
harbaughs and losing control of their teams name a more iconic duo
removed
this game is over everyone should be rooting for this team to lose out for a better draft pick
i also hate newton with that damn hair just looks like a doofus makes me angry when i see it
jackson aint ever going to lead this team to a chip
how long yall think lamar will last in the league 2025 at the latest for me
patrick queen is having arguably the worst game ive ever seen a ravens mlb have and he needs to be say immediately he aint ready
this is fucking shit harbaugh needs to go too hes too far up his ass we have insane talent and arent winning why because of the fucking coaching suck up the fucking cum and admit this isnt working this is insane
we really suck this yr downvote all you want its the truth
patrick queen turd
removed
not bad for a running back
lamar with the choke
said earlier theyre gonna lose 1714 stand by it
with this weather feels like a game the ravens lose 1714 because they make a few mistakes and the clock never stops running as both teams keep it on the ground


yo queen is straight trash
this is just not going to be our year fellas defense is ok but has weaknesses and our offense is putrid
i know injuries are hurting us but are we just bad in prime time games or what
sneed afraid of it lamar throwing up ambulance bills for these guys to catch
flacco confirmed better than lamar

lol imagine what mahomes will do to this panty wearing pussy defense if someone like scameron is humiliating them
ravens had no issues getting flacco offensive weapons why cant we get lamar some weapons

edit yall can downvote me all you want idc but yall cant tell me flacco didnt have more offensive weapons than lamar currently has
we havent had receivers like boldin torrey smith and steve smith in a minute

damn near the best receivers weve had and they were under flacco
this team needs a fucking down season so we can get a good defensive player or real wr

this team is a pain to watch
fucking idiots i cant im turning this shit off
lol lets fucking go pats
when was the last time we won from behind
at minimum that judon play is a dpi the ball was in the air stupid play
ah thanks lamer lets put this shit defense back on the field

every time i fuck my busty latina gamer girlfriend when shes on her period my balls itch like a bitch afterwards i gotta start tittyfucking her when its shark week bro
happy cake day
that cardinals game is a true testament to this statement now im not saying deandre hopkins caliber players grow on trees but we gotta keep trying to find him a true number one or at least another weapon to add to our already promising tight end and young receiver core second round next year there should be a promising receiver there i pray to god we snag one and he actually pans out i would love to see lamar with a great receiver he could just throw it up to
top 3 wrs dont really grow on trees id settle for a top 32 one
dhop is the only dhop caliber receiver in the world right now
literally my thought who do we have on the team who could go up and make plays like that on their own our receivers we have rn are way too dependent on lamar throwing every ball perfectly if we ever want the offense to take the next step we need to go get a true high caliber 1 something we ignored with flacco for years after that super bowl win we cant continue this cycle of mediocre wrs forever
they dont exist he is one of one
we have souljas we just dont use them never
step 1 find a dhop caliber receiver
hollywood gets targets 10 in last 2 games and cant produce our tes are the only ones who catch contested passes reality is the heart aint there for our receivers yet
we got dez bro throw up the x
they dont even need a dhop like receiver they just need a reliable guy and a oc that can utilize him imagine how dangerous this team could be with andrews and a guy like allen robinson out there could open up a lot of opportunities for hollywood too
came here to say the same god damn thing
i 100 agree i really wanna hope dez bryant is that receiver but hes been out for so long that i dont know
a receiver with half the skill of dhop would be the best wr weve ever had
i guess no one remembers when ab was available and all those damn ppl said no
everybody saw how the bills offense looks so much more explosive and varied with diggs too

the same thing happened in dallas with dak the cowboys traded a 1st round pick midseason for amari cooperand dak and the passing game took the fuck off and never looked back
i think lamar and our offense as a whole would benefit more with stud ol te a good wr would be a luxury but lamars skill set is better complimented by the big guys
what good will that do if he cant throw the ball to himravens fans stay feasting on shit
lol second round dhop caliber receiver
im agitated by the fo putting so much resources into the defense just for them to choke against a 35 team while they neglect the offense its a problem that they dont seem pressed to get lamar better weapons
allen robinson will be available
why is this sub so obsessed with getting a top wr we could have prime randy moss on this squad and he would be nothing more than a top 32 player there is no wr in existence that can make a play without targets


ive seen way too many of these games this year where everyone predicts the same winner then they get smoked
damn good job mike
and now mike has the best record of the bunch

mikes paid for clicks gotta create that content for nbcsports
it seems like all of them are just 50
well he was right
how about now

straight up disrespectful that you arent rooting against us
if the steelers were playing the pats id be the biggest pats fan that night fuck the steelers
id maybe maybe understand if you were fighting with the pats for a 1 seed but theyre 35 why in the world are you cheering for us
last year we often ran a 3te set and obviously found a lot of success we havent ran it much if at all since trading hurst why do we not run it with ricard
we did run it with ricard earlier in the year and it didnt work
ricard boyle arent enough of a threat to catch passes teams just stack 910 in the box crush the run because they know whats coming with boyle hurst and andrews out there teams had to respect the pa pass now bracket andrews with a safety cb your other corner can watch boyle and dont bother because ricard isnt catching a pass that leaves 89 guys to stop the run or pressure the qb

if we lose to this team we are officially pretenders this year
pats are 35 not exactly playoff caliber this season
probably not just like the browns
if we lose its a big game if we win its beating a mediocre injured team regardless we need to do our job and win
any game we lose will be a big game
i dont think this is a big game since it doesnt have a big effect on whether or not we make the playoffs and its still relatively early
according to the media yes

id rather target duv over hollywood at this point at least hes willing to get some yac
i have been screaming this the man makes plays
swap him with hollywood
hes better than hollywood im ready to admit
lots of talent on the field
and terrell bonds
lamar cam and mark whose the 4th
god i love this

hopefully it blows over im from eastern ny and you guys are getting the after math of our storm from earlier it blew through fairly quick but it was not pretty
be safe
didnt realize they had tornados that far north tbh
removed

the ravens really need to tighten up their discipline on the field we get way too many penalties and we are opening ourselves up to allow the referees to screw us in critical moments

i could argue many of the penalties seem a bit tickytacky but they are still penalties most of the time
idk the first was unfortunate he missed the fair catch call and the second was garbage
flag was bs
if our penalties are bad it should be pretty easy to show on a chart or website could you present some evidence


already am
im not having a good time
isnt justin ellis supposed to be good just by being fat
hopefully they can get some healthy run stoppers back for next week
we need to throw away this whole season for a better draft

does patrick queen just not know how to cover that play was completely locked up by everybody and he blew coverage on a throw made by a freakin wr
right also how did elliot not see it coming either that was so obvious
bills out here making queen look like a fool

the interior oline was playing very mediocre before the stanley injury anyway also dont forget phillips is out and fluker is technically out of position
but who will fill that spot
we need to draft a tackle in the middle rounds to groom and replace obj with but at the same time to be a high level backup for stanley or obj should either go down
yeah we have our b team out here

its just him forcing it downfield idk why he made that decision we just needed 5 or 10 for a tuck fg and we go into half tied instead were down 3 and we cant stop their offense whatsoever
it would be a pretty funny sight if hollywood actually mossed someone though that corner would be getting clowned for the rest of the season
that was a bad throw should have been infront of him to the boundary too far inside and too on a rope not a bad decision thats basically the same decision he made against arizona when hollywood iced the game
whats the point of having soldiers if they cant get open or drop the ball all the time
meanwhile just another week of duvernay being completely underutilized its infuriating to watch he will be our best receiver next year when harbaugh decides hes allowed to play seriously what is with harbaugh not playing rookies unless he absolutely has to we should be using him the same way the saints use michael thomas slants and screens get him the ball underneath in space and let him do his thing hes electric with the ball in his hands and spoiler alert getting quick hitters to a guy like duvernay to complement dobbins and edwards running seriously ingram shouldnt see the field at all will open things up for brown deep zzz
that endzone throw is a route that boykin should be running not our 59 wr
the cardinals just won a game because they have a 1 wr who can singlehandedly beat triple coverage

if he doesnt outrun the db by at least 57 yards hollywood cant even beat single coverage

hes 59 on a good day the average nfl db is just a shade under six feet literally all they have to do is keep relatively close and hes out of the play unless lamar throws him a pinpointperfect ball hes not outjumping them hes not outmuscling them all he can do is outrun them and while he might be faster than them hes not faster by a big enough margin to make it work as often as an nfllevel wr1 needs to

should we be doing more to scheme around our weaknesses absolutely hollywoods tiny and fast so move him around dont just have him line up as an x and call it a day get him in space put him against linebackers where his speed can spring him open in space theres talent there and smart coordinators make use of that talent as effectively as possible look at how the patriots used to operate with brady they had gronk and a bunch of tiny slot receivers like edelman and welker but they made it work with smart reads and good scheming

we can get good production from hollywood probably not 100 catch 1200 yard production but more than enough to thrive in a runheavy offense that doesnt throw a lot of passes for a lot of yards we just greg to use him to the best of his skillset rather than trying to shove a square peg into a round hole

that said you dont have to scheme around the weaknesses of a 1 wr unless he starts putting in the work to develop the kind of routerunning perfection his cousin used to shake defenders in spite of his size hes not an nfl wr1 and the longer the ravens expect him to be one the more disappointed theyre going to keep being again look at the kind of boon nuk has been for murray look at what diggs is able to do for allen shit not just the young guys look at what metcalf is doing for russ we need to get lamar a real 1 this offseason not a retread who hasnt played in years not a speedy guy whos so tiny he makes our rbs look like ots whether its a trade or a draft get lamar a real target
truuu
hollywood wont stay a raven hell eventually be cut hes a bust
i didnt like the pick when they made it and i still dont

if they move him to a slot 3 wr then im happy and fine with that hes not a 1 or 2 on this team or league
right thats not his game
i love hollywood and have never dont think have said shit about him here before but this man hes not going to make it long the way he plays

x200b

in his mind he is jerry rice took a lot not to type his stupid ass cousin here

x200b

he is not yet
id love to see this work out but in the long run dont
yet a one trick pony is lamars no 1 wr

the same way desean jackson or will fuller or ted ginn jr are not no 1 wrs

neither is hollywood

lamar begged the front office to go get browns cousin and the front office went and got dez bryant instead

just awful
put brown in the slot change his routes 90 of browns routes are go routes
i know whos going to be wishing for a wr for christmas
the hollywood pick was a luxury pick dude does not fit in here
hes also what 6 inches shorter than moss hes not a big body jump ball kind of receiver like moss and megatron hes more like a jerry rice
yep and thats what i hope we can get out of dez
roman totally told him to take a shot there dont think anyone in the right mind would force it in there

removed
at least until he stops running lazy routes we can only blame gr for so much
dont understand why the qb even throws to him when theres 0 seperation
we need to use our souljas
for a guy thats sposed to have game breaking speed he sure spends a lot of time in opposing dbs hip pockets
its not working
supposed to be a sub 430 burner yet cant get separation on a simple go route
he is not a number one receiver i though everyone already surpassed that point trying to fit a ball without him getting separation will always turn out either on a pick or an incompletionthe guy will not moss over anybody pointless
we couldve had dk
right if hes not burning folks he should not be targeted
shouldve gotten dk
ngl im getting mad that we chose hollywood over aj brown and metcalf he had his chances tonight and failed miserably as much as i hate roman he has to deliver too and prove he can
i hope this game humbled hollywood a little bit because hes clearly not as good as he thinks he is
cant believe that throw he decided that ball was going to brown presnap just unbelievable but we still got this
hes ted ginn with a cool nickname at this point
looks like everyone is coming to my way of thinking

marquise brown sucks
trade this guy or something clearly lamar is too tight with him to the point where he is forcing balls into double coverage
and trying to pass to brown again on 4th
and it looked like he was going to have a breakout year
hollywood is a 3 wr at best in the nfl

he needs to be in the slot until then hes a bust and wasted draft pick didnt like it then and hes not convinced me to like it since
2019 wr draft class hollywood to boykins

1 marquise brown bal
2 nkeal harry ne
3 deebo samuel sf
4 aj brown ten
5 mecole hardman kc
6 jj arcegawhiteside phi
7 paris campbell ind
8 dk metcalf sea
9 dionte johnson pit
10 jalen hurd sf
11 terry mclaurin was
12 miles boykins bal
funny i thought the same thing when lamar threw that long pass he needs to shut up and get better at playing his position
yall did see hollywood get overthrown for a td last night right that int wasnt on him either it was perfectly thrown for the cb outside and short a lot of this is on the oline not giving lamar time and the other wrs not taking some pressureattention off hollywood isnt blameless but hes been missed a lot this season and thats on others when it happens
everyone last season man i love hollywood and lamar

now lamar sucks and we shouldve gotten dk

its pretty easy to tell the difference between ravens fans and the bandwagons that hopped on after lamar was popping
dk would not be good for this team so can we just stop with it every week aj brown is a miss mclaurin is a miss dk is a straight line burner who we would be getting 4 targets a game if that
removed
if this pick doesnt prove that we need a wr i dont know what does we need a guy to bail lamar out i completely understand we have a lot of guys injured and im trying to approach this with a level head but hollywood aint it he has the potential of being a great side guy when there are multiple options but in no way is a 1 that just proved it
i honestly think that thats what theyre gonna go in at halftime talking about hollywood hasnt separated all night time to move him somewhere and see what duvernayproche can do
why would lamar even throw to him there was zero seperation and you still have a time out to work with
this is pointless right now brown cant catch these balls without getting separation he is a slot receiver always dunking afraid of getting hit at best
hes like a smaller slower jacoby jones and this dude is considered their number one guy is such a disappointment
guy spends more time trying to play the game like madden but when its time to catch the ball his controller dies
i also think the issue is our play calling is so basic and unoriginal anyone could cover our wrs
removed
we literally won from behind last week
i guess this is your first week on the bandwagon because the ravens were losing at half against the colts last week did you stop watching then
hope this is sarcastic
go back to wherever you came from band wagoner
but dont the pats have a bottom 6 or so rushing defense
27th i think
31st run defense

hes not a bust these overreactions are getting dumber and dumber
we shoulda got dk

eat ass


does anyone else see the passes going to brown being perfect for dezboykinhear me out hollywood isnt big and isnt a physical receiver hes just fast those throws showed me that a allen robinson brandon marshall dj chark type is a necessity here
those passes are for everyone that has some height andor plays with physicality so yes brown must be on the bench looking
dez woulda caught that
underthrown
hope we can steal auden tate from cincy this offseason hes buried behind a stacked wr corps but hed be perfect for this offense
every1 not name greg roman sees it
boykin isnt a physical receiver i dare say hollywood fights more for the ball and takes bigger hits
boykin is so slow so slow he doesnt even look like he belongs on an nfl field
greg roman and hollywood must go

queen looks lost out there twice he let the runner run past untouched this drive
removed
really not looking good going forward
campbell and williams titans coming up yikes
injuries are so bad right now even if we make the playoffs were not gonna have a team anymore
our season is over and our future looks terrible we have aging and injury prone guys we have zero depth no replacement te at all below average wrs oline is playing worse

im trying not to be a doomer but its hard right now
this is just my opinion as a browns fans i like lamar and really respect him from the beginning even before the 18 draft i never thought lamar would be this good but harbs has done a great job with him

i think his current struggles are on the oc and not lamar i kinda compare it to keap and the 49ers when roman was the oc there keap in his first full season under roman in 13 had a very good season nothing like jacksons first full season but both had very good seasons under roman but about 6 games into keaps 2nd season as a starter under roman the wheels started to fall off the offense i think its very similar what is going on with the offense i dont think its defenses finally figuring out lamar its just defenses are figuring out romans scheme

feel like harbs needs to force roman to adapt a little bit as an oc or they need to get a new oc
we know
everyone thinksknows that hes a fraud
weve been saying this shit since week 2 lmfao
thanks but we all know this and have known this for weeks
real fucking hot take this one
hey everyone pay attention a browns fan has been able to identify this teams issues
what the fuck

also fire greg roman
i prefer fire greg roman
calm down theres still a lot of game left to play
matt skura sucks
cut matt skura
nooooo not boyle
fire roman hes been garbage all year and just doesnt seem to get better at all literally just trying random shit every game
fire greg roman
wefucking suck
the only expectation i have anymore is that this team will find new ways to dissapoint
on 4th and 1 in the pouring fucking rain romans dumb ass calls wildcat for the first time this year get that fucking dumbass out of there
they called a wildcat against the texans on a 4th and 1 to ingram
i would love to just be able to hear what the fuck was going through his head that made him say wildcat in the rain on a 4th and 1 is genius
came here to make this post

x200b

you have lamar fckn jackson at qb why is direct snap to a rb even an option

x200b

roman should be gone for everything before that play this season or just for that call amazingly terrible
has greg roman heard of this nifty play called the qb sneak
greg roman has been holding this offense back he has to go now its unacceptable to make that playcall
please please please fire him
i wonder if he makes that call if he was actually standing out on the sideline in the pissing rain probably
there are so many other reasons to be upset about this game calling for romans head for that is at the bottom of that list
the play call was fine the execution specifically the snap are what sucked
i have never ever seen a dumber fucking call in a ravens game never what the fucking hell are you thinking

legitimately one of the worst playcalls i have ever seen i could talk for hours about why that was a stupid idea
he wont get let go because of the rain and injuries this week im sure he wont be let go because the offense scores 20 and barely loses next week and then by week 13 when our season hangs on the line of winning out well maybe just maybe make a change
dont be ridiculous he has no clue its on fire
on 2nd and goal and 3rd and goal in a 77 game he had justice hill in the game wtf
1 rushing offense vs 31st ranked rushing defense in dvoa and he dials that up
any interviewer after this game please

greg did you ever consider given the issues with the snaps to run some plays from under center

greg why in a game with torrential rain did you only hand the ball of 17 times
jesus christ when was the last time we had a good offensive coordinator
theres a lot of reasons to make him give up playcalling responsibilities but one thing that always makes me unrationally angry is seeing coordinators always in the booth

like get on the sideline and actually talk to your team
please fire him
too wet for any fire

who all i know is matthew judon
he said that and then they showed mcphee in the play they were talking about lmao
where the hell has yannack been
still hurting from letting zadarius walk
mandatory dumbfuck flag from judon gotta have one every game
i remember earlier this season when marlon humphrey was our best rusher
i mean he is
sad to say
he logged his 3rd sack on the season and his first sack against someone that wasnt on the washington football team

welcome to camp its lamars fault when the ravens lose but hes never the reason they win
doesnt matter tomorrow were going to get blasted by the media like the clippers got blasted after their meltdown
its a toxic cocktail of new fans not being around for the preflacco and post 2014 flacco era the increased expectations for an mvp quarterback some genuine areas of improvement and honestly some groups who want to see someone like lamar who doesnt fit a more traditional qb mold fail
ive never been so sad in my life
im glad its not just us normal fans who have some football knowledge

yes lamar has made some questionable decisions this year and last year who doesnt the difference this year is the fact that the ball isnt rolling his way and there arent explosive plays to make up for everything that is going wrong

ravens are in a strange place because they seem to be trying to run a new offense with less personnel and lamar is forcing the ball to covered players i assume he is either just trying to make something out of nothing or just not reading the plays the wr arent really getting separation as much as they did last year
its the reverse of the flacco era back then anything good was because of everyone but flacco and he was to blame for all losses

i got truss


prayers up for boyle its like 2015 all over again
he can
our receivers cant
the bigger question is can the defense stop the run without williams and campbell
i think the question is will the defense decide to show up or have an extra bye week
skura has other ideas
he cant
removed
he left boyle out to dry

please take this guys leg instead
our season is done
hoping for the best
his season is over wish the best for his recovery
tough bastard didnt even looked fazed as he was carted off hoping for a speedy and fully healthy recovery
they should go win it for boyles
man hope its just a hyper extended kinda deal looked bad

injuries killing us this year
mad respect for the patriots who immediately called for help that crack echoed throughout the stadium
im sick
pain
best of wishes that he heals quickly that hit was sickening to watch
im gonna cry over this one genuinely my favorite player on the offense best hands among the pass catchers and an incredible blocker
this season is so 2020injury bug is killin us this seasoncome on 2021
prayers to the big homie nick does dez get a shot now and do we see some spread out wr sets cause that might be interesting
sending well wishes to boyle hope its not too bad and he comes back healthy
i heard a crack i hope his career isnt over
that injury looked brutal
that hit reminds me of the one put on dustin kellers leg by dj swearinger
pats fan checking in here hoping boyle recovers well and can come back next season and play for yall hate these type of injuries regardless of whos playing good luck on the rest of the season
pats fan coming in peace and concern all the best for boyles recovery and bless all the remaining knees
dirty play
sending as much good juju as i can muster recovery smoothly nick
that injury was hard to watch hoping for a full and speedy recovery for nick
omg this is some dennis pitta ptsd all over again we dont have tes anymore
coming in peace that looked gnarly hoping for the best
i hope that wasnt a broken hip it looked bad
rip



i mean that penalty on him was really weak and i think he actually got the first sack on cam today im more concerned im not hearing anything from yannick given we traded for him i do think hes pressuring but need to see sacks
judon had a good game made some nice plays and that call on him was pretty shit guy wasnt a receiver or defenseless but it was a little unnecessary
cuz he sucks the good plays he made tonight he should be doing that all the time

i swear half the ppl on this sub arent true ravens fan

we lost 6 games the year we won the super bowl and you wanna forfeit the season we dont need fans like you
as boyle leg just snapped sign me up
we have a pretty cake schedule so we will win at least 910 get bounced first round and not have a great draft pick
what does the league expect when they spent the last 3 years calling shoulder to shoulder hits as helmet to helmet players are going to go low to avoid and destroy knees

surprised it doesnt happen more
bruh were gonna go 115 this year dont sweat it hopefully get somewhere in the draft rinse and repeat
now that the seasons over
god i wouldve hated to see how youd react in 2012 when we lost to the charlie batch lead steelers
a new offensive coordinator
dude calm down dont be so reactionary
the seasons not over but this is a good question lots of spots to fill that need first round talent

christ a center
this team needs a receiver bad
im not the doom and gloom type of guy but yeah were fucked were missing key players everywhere and our guys are getting older and coming off injuries with boyle out id like to see us invest heavily into te and ol
hopefully jamarr chase is around
leon sandcastle if he falls to us

win it for boyles big trusss
we got this boys faith
truzz
lamar has been balling man pls defense
im with you impressed with jackson and the offense these defense injuries are unfortunate nick boyle
i beleeeeeeeeeve the defense will let us down
first things first prayers for nick boyle

we are currently only down one score and all these ppl saying to end the game and forfeit the season

this is bmore we battle through adversity we rise up how quickly these new fans forget the turmoil we went through in 2012 before we won it all

i get that this is probably the most season ending injuries this team has had in one season maybe ever but its football nobody on this roster is going to give up cus of injuries and its sickening how everyone on this sub is you think boyle wants to forfeit the season because he hurt his leg fuck outta here

truzz for life
anyone else in here for ravens jags in 2011 on mnf

that was a highlight for me really
some people have never experienced kyle boller
i feel like this gets posted every time we lose

people have the right to be mad after a loss
you can be a true fan and still call out poor execution play calling and body language we had all three tonight
imma probably get downvoted but calling out our team for being fucking trash against a team we shouldnt beat isnt being a fake fan these positive posts every time we play like ass are getting kinda tiring
even if we lose its not the end of the season
let us be mad that we lost to a bad team

i live in fucking australia and have gotten up at 5am to watch every single game for years i am as authentic a fan as can be

doesnt mean im not pissed off at this team
spoken like an orioles fan
listen i get it be optimistic but being a ravens fan since the day i was born and watching football since i can remember this team is really concerning lamar is having a rough season play calling is disgusting o line cant avoid penalties defense isnt consistent the list goes on afc is stacked with good teams and i cant see us beating them in january this year its fine to be realistic
the fake fans are the ones that think everything is hunky dory gonlcuky happy we cant be content with losing to a 35 pats weather isnt to blame they had to play in it too its our own play to blame sorry some of us actually care about improving and getting better through a gameseasoncareer when coaches and players dont we call them out when coaches and players never improve we want them gone its not that hard we want to win and be competitive and this lineup does not give us that
one of my biggest pet peeves on sports forums is loyalty policing at the end of the day sports teams are a product and fans are entitled to feel however they want edit as long as they arent hurtingharassing anyone

that said

this game was an aberration

i dont think you can assume were not going to be able to snap the ball and its not going to be a typhoon in january

and this is the patriots they may have gotten off to a slow start this season but they didnt have full camp with their new qb they are better than the record imo
shut the fuck up im a fan of this team and ill call shit out if i see it
gotta disagree with this post no ones saying end the season youre being dramatic people are frustrated with romans play calls the dropped passes some weak throws judon consistently being an idiot etc

totally agree part of being a fan is battling through adversity the struggle is part of the game however fake fans are ones who only watch when teams are good ie americans suddenly caring about soccer during the world cup what were actually seeing in this sub is a lot of fans getting disappointed in how the seasons going to be fair theyve still had a good season so far but this is not the team they were last year everyone knows that part of it is missing yanda a lot of it is bad coaching and play calls a lot of it is injuries

part of being a real fan is acknowledging your team has weaknesses some fans here dont want to here anything remotely negative or critical im all for being supportive and sticking with them through the season but if youre the type of fan who refuses to hear anything critical youre not what id consider a real fan real fans listen to criticism because they know theres always room for improvement a real fanbase is dedicated and loyal but isnt an echochamber good fanbases are critical so that they can make the team better
the game subs are for quickgutreal time reaction youre not going to get measured responses especially when the team looks like this you know it will be people venting during a loss so why join if you dont like it

pointing out obvious flaws and being mad about them doesnt make you a fake fan honestly dont know how many times that needs to be said
this aged well

look people have a right to be negative just as much as you have a right to be positive i get you want to remain positive and try to look at the bright side but the fact of the matter is were underperforming injured and have a bad oc remain positive if you want to but dont tell others how they should feel about something and maybe refrain from calling people fake fans
we have had the same problems on offense all season and nothing has been fixed now our team is being decimated by injuries fuck off with these stupid posts we should be concerned we have played bad in more than 3 games
you say fake ravens fans but i see people who realize what pretenders we are weve looked like shit in almost every single game win or loss lets not act like everything is sunshine and daisies when the team isnt all that great just trying to be real here ive been a fan since 2005 so spare me the fake fan crap
look let those that are going to leave leave im still going to route for the ravens to smash the titans next week and even if we lose that ill route for them to end the steelers bullshit undefeated season and if they lose that ima still ride or die

but

this team was put together to win the superbowl heralded as a top 4 contender fans have the right to be upset about that because at current pace yes there are injuries we arent even top 4 in the afc

let the bandwagons hop but fans of this team should be pissed the fuck off if youre not id say thats soft this sunshine and rainbows shit may fly for west coast teams but its not the ravens i know
this post always pops up every time the ravens play poorly can people not allow others to complain when we lose to a new england team that i dont think anyone on the planet thought would score more than 14 points against us let alone be able to beat us or a team that almost allowed cam newton to throw for two tds when he had two total coming into this game get off the high horse where you think you can label someone a fake fan just because heshe is calling out uninspiring gameplay

if this team goes on to win out and finish 133 and win the super bowl ill be celebrating along with everyone else but that doesnt mean im going to apologize for criticizing the team in week 10 the same people saying that we should all be sitting in a circle singing kumbaya and praising the team are probably the ones who also have been clamoring for greg roman to be fired for the last four weeks if you want to act like there are no issues with this team just because were 63 and have a winning record go ahead but dont act like youre more of a fan just because you feel that way ive been a fan since this team came into existence and ill call them out for playing like trash when thats what theyre doing
doesnt feel like its our year
yessirrr every ravens fan knows it just aint a ravens regular season without some injuries lol
ill be honest i love when ravens are underdogs or facing adversity i feel like they play with more aggressiveness and passion im hoping the rain calms down a lil it would help a lot
offensive looks great minus the botched snap on 4th and the int if defense decides to show up despite the injuries i am confident
fake fans no its fans calling out the shit play from this team i dont drink the kool aid im a realist this team may make the playoffs but they arent doing anything more than that
i just wanna see some positivity up in here instead of this toxic bullshit

it fucking sucks that boyle had to go down like that and that weve had so many injuries this year but i for one am not counting this team out we feast on adversity as ray lewis once said its time to rise up
game overstill down a score now what
its all well and good but we need to come to terms with how badly mangled this team is right now missing campbell williams fort tavon jimmy smith on defense and then stanley and now boyle on offense which has just turned the offensive line into a dogs breakfast like i just dont think we have the ponies to be very good as it stands
fuck that ive been a fan of this team since they came back to baltimore ive seen better attempts at a4th quarter comeback drive from kyle fucking boller wtf was that
everyone just wants to fire the coordinator whenever things arent going perfect

hope boyle isnt in pain right now and the defense can get some stops and we pull out this w
yeah we lost but were still 63 expectations were high but come the fuck on its still been a good season so far

and we shouldnt be calling fans fake they are real fans they suck all of the enjoyment out of the game day threads they are basically babies who cant handle adversity but they are real fans who like the team just as much as everyone else
bears fan here in peace in respect

love what you guys have been doing

want to see some toxic negativity check out our sub we had that one successful season in 18 and since then every game we lose its fire nagy fire pace sell the team

keep the faith real fans stick around

and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be liftednevermore
i remember in 2018 and during the broncos game i said to keep our heads up we can still win and got downvoted we eventually won that game but im pretty sure the sub has had the same mentality for a while
people love to say some fans have never experienced kyle boller but thats exactly it we have lamar jackson not kyle boller and this team should be doing more because of it
were all riding this massive high from 2019 and have been crashing since the titans game fortunately were still in it but it hurts to be sent crashing back to earth so fast
there is quit in this team that is the difference
lmao its like everything that hits the top of rravens is cringeworthy pasta

i strongly agree with the first line but everything after it is hilarious
im frustrated and disappointed but those are the same feelings i had a decade ago remember that loss in atlanta week 10 in 2010 remember week 10 to the seahawks in 2011 and like you said the hellish end to 2012

i think the high of last year just made us think the sky is the limit once again but with the steelers flying higher than us and were back to where we should be which is still a solid spot to be in its a bit of a smack in the face to be like woah what happened here

2020 has just been rough in general but long term were going to have a hell of a lot of fun cheering for this franchise after flacco was drafted in 2008 we went on a 5 year run where we probably could have won 4 super bowls if we had a few bounces go our way lamar is 23 the same age joe was when he got drafted were going to be fine
been a ravens fan since 05 and a quote that sums up this team most years that i love is harbaughs after the super bowl win it wasnt pretty it wasnt perfect but it was us

last season it was so easy for a youngcasual fan to hop on the bandwagon this season is more in line with a typical harbaugh year a mostly solid team with some notable flaws overcoming key injuries and some great wins and a few disappointing losses

personally i dont think the ravens will win the title this year i had my reservations going into the season and chiefs loss was so ugly it forced to reevaluate expectations that said the core of the tem is still very strong and they will be in the hunt for years yuo cant ask for much more than that as a fan
uh oh the loyalty cops are here everyone scram
pussy attitude i want more not this bullshit were given

we pay for merchandise and with our time to watch this shit we expect better

dont whine for millions and put out a shit product
skura had a tough game
onto the titans
i kinda expected this loss ngl
i dont see anyone saying to end the season because he went down true ravens fans down care who has the jersey on they cheer for the ravens no matter who wears that beautiful jersey
we keep not adjusting were not fake fans for being confused and angry that the team refuses to play to its strengths
they disagree with you therefore theyre fake that logic isnt sound

i know this is a hot take but at least the game wasnt decided by jackson or at least jackson shouldnt feel like its his fault hes a good leader for the team he will always take the blame or responsibility for the loss or things not working out but today i finally feel like he shouldnt he had a meaningless interception his receivers had dropped passes which with the weather not full blame but man we committed alot of penalties we are starting to rack up the injuries like the 49ers but to take those losses especially mid game and still only lose by six count your blessings could have absolutely been worse on the scoreboard lets hope injuries arent too long lasting we have playoffs to go to
in the topic of fake fans im new to posting here on this sub but not a new ravens fan i live in central ohio i admit i was a browns fan when all of my family that watched nfl were bengals fans i followed the team out of cleveland and watched the team become the baltimore ravens that was something special are we allowed to be upset absolutely prayers for all the players that are injured i knew this game wasnt a given my uncle who is like my second father is a huge bengals fan he has been a season ticket holder for the bengals for the last 25 years every year for my birthday he gives me one of his ravens tickets my happy ass will be cheering from paul brown stadium on january 3rd last year we saw lamar break out with his infamous juke sequence run and sit on the bench with his hater blockers my uncle said you know that makes me sick right i said sit down shut up
im a ravens fans since 2018 since i started watching football and im kinda sad when i see the comments that there are fans who loved the ravens but after the loss to the steelers they will go to dolphins because they know what to to with young talents and yes i also think lamar isnt playing like hes mvp season but he was the mvp he knows how to play he will come back he can only grow we stand at 63 and we still can make the playoffs
im sticking with my 115 prediction hopefully get a playoff win this year as high as expectations are people have to remember how incredibly young the core of this team is give it a few years if the fans dont run off too many players and play calling improves i still think the ravens have something special
it was frustrating to say the least watching the outcome of the game and the opportunities there
injuries bad timing and the weather wasnt ideal

we played a patriots team who still has belichik as their head coach and dude has a hard on for handing us ls

we are 63 in a very exciting and tough division

im still with baltimore today and forever
win lose or tie ravens fan until i die
delete this shit gate keeping is trash sure there are bandwagons but when a team with high hopes looks like dogshit on national tv twice its not a good look and fans are allowed to be mad
fire greg roman
theres a ton of shitty poisonous takes in this sub even if we lose were were 63 and still in it fuck these sell the whole team takes
football often has close games even if you think the team your playing isnt great everyone on the field is a professional athlete and can has a chance of making great plays
you dont battle through adversity your team does
i watched 511 we will be fine
injuries and not addressing big needs two of our main issues i love my team but im disappointed
that was tough but i feel like we know what our problems are
some people never care about always improving and striving to be a better player and working out your weaknesses oh wait yall are content with that
we are the david of the nfl we always have to slay goliath tom and now mahomes nothing new lol
looks like we gotta bank on the os this year that being said we dropped 5 out of our last 6 in 2012 and the rest is history truzz
any updates on boyle i had to finish up my homework so i didnt hear any and i cant find any anywhere
i hope we permaban them
i think we get shit on disproportionately by the media everyone wants to shit on the small market team especially when they have rivalries with two of the biggest national markets the steelers and the patriots to appease it ticking sucks to lose a trap game like this but thats why they are trap games this is still a 10 win season and the ravens arent regressing its just really really hard to have a consecutive 1 regular season let alone with getting smacked with the injury carousel
honestly was good to see us open up the passing game well get better
i love our qb dont get me wrong but he has to take some responsibility if he wants to be a leader for this team why the hell doesnt he step up and say our center sucks right now lets maybe take some snaps under center like a real goddamn qb would why be in shotgun in the pouring rain all game when the center has been hiking the ball to the ref all game i know its partly the oc fault but lamar has to have some say in the offensive play calling
people react differently i wouldnt call them fake id say finicky a friend in rl acts doom and gloom after a loss but gets over it its just their personality
were ravens fans thats what you get when we lose were not team with losing mentality so when we lose were way more vocal about it
so brave have three virtue points and a gatekeeping badge for your work
i think you are mistaken i was promised a team that was behind lamar i was promised two working coordinators and not the legit same drive down the field thats now being stopped we invested in the defense when our offensive line is struggling to the point lamar is taking unnecessary hits in the back field i think defenses that injury players in the first quarter via rolling in the back field should be a penalty of sorts and a fine to discourage going for ankles of unaware lineman if we had any decent back ups if we kept hurst we would be in a different spot but we arent we are stuck with an attitude driven defense that punches the ball more than making a tackle we have an offense that doesnt know where to go with the football and a head coach that made promises and two coordinators that are getting an easy paycheck while doing nothing to change our plan of attack im fed up with being beaten by superior coaching staffs and tbh very frank it has everything to do with the fact that everyone boasts chains and swag and merch they make money on and dont even play to a standard we expected out of them the d line looks fat not strong not trying to move the o line back or run across the field to stop sweep plays at the line of scrimmage ive been here since 08 ive come to expect we beat the patriots at home that is the raven way obviously not anymore and what way are we headed below 88 fs
dude the game threads are more toxic than nuclear waste its ridiculous

like yes we can blame jackson for things here and there that interception was a bad choice but he goes 1419 and 167 yards to 8 different receivers and after that one pick a slew of weak dicked shit monsters are like lamar sucks he cant throw

the shit thing is the pass itself was not a bad pass it was a bad choice to throw it but it landed exactly where brown should have been brown got beat brown kind of sucked last night

last nights loss was not lamar jacksons faults he made amazing plays multiple that were called back because of oline penalties snead dropped 2 or 3 completely catchable balls i know it was raining and awful but fuck man any dick hole that can turn around and blame jackson in anyway for that loss is neither a fan or the ravens or football in general because they closely just dont understand the game
this team and the 2012 team are not similar at all ravens were underdog in almost every game no hype just flacco and co going out and taking care of business each week this team is overhyped over confident and not good enough to back it up
doesnt mean this season hasnt been frustrating at points especially lamars regression and this game was just pure frustration after that steelers game just because we arent dedicated bootlickers doesnt mean people arent real fans

but in all honesty we are an extremely spoiled fanbase like 20 years of existence 2 superbowls 20 with 10 playoff appearances some of the best players of all time etc etc
why didnt you post this before the last touchdown
i have to remind myself to stay off the game thread some of the shit i see on there is ridiculous lol
there is a time to be outraged and a time to think clearly

this is the time to be outraged what this season could have been if we didnt lose 90 of the ol our best te our best dl our best safety and our entire cb depth beyond hump and peters

fans have a right to be pissed and say the seasons over the team is playing horribly it might be a business that belongs to steve bisciotti but the team belongs to baltimore and its fans and we have a right to be upset with their performance and the way things are panning out this year fuck off with that fake fan shit ive been here since the beginning i have a right to be angry with how things are going and i have a right to overreact to that in the moment
seriously im getting tired of all of doom going on everyone should know this shit dont matter until the playoffs if you learned 1 thing from last year that is it
this is exactly how i feel as a cowboys fan this season so many fans came with dak as they should but people wanting to bail after he was injured means that this isnt your team
personally the problem is theres like no signs of hope with this team for this season center keeps fuckin up snaps a new starter gets injured every game still no sign of a passing game still cant win tough games and come from behind
cant come back down 10 points with lamar as qb has never happen

yooo lmaoooo
really though why the fuck did they not line up under center with the weather the way it was
replacing him with somebody who can barely block would be a net positive at this point i legitimately hope i never see skura play another snap as a raven his mistakes are just too costly
great meme
so good
elite
this is it chief
ngl this is my first season as a ravens fan seeing that i actually made a meme that made sense feels nice thanks flock
well played sir this makes me feel a little better
i needed that
also nick boyles leg please forgive me
lmaooo
rthanosdidnothingwrong
this is a flacco level meme
skura played right guard last night
wet game coming off a potential career ending injuryrough to throw him under the bus fake fans are the worst

prayers up for nick boyle who is next man up what moves will we make
i volunteer
we did host luke willson so that might be the move
i believe theres a few tes they had in the offseason theyll probably look into bringing in we shouldve had another actual te but they settled with having project pat fill the 3rd te spot
edc not going after a replacement for hayden hurst is hurting this team more than people imagine why did u decide to not go after a 3rd te after we were the most dominant team running 3 tes is a horrible decision
i knew getting rid of hayden hurst was going to bite us in the ass
whats scary too is that andrews is injury prone as well
can i just give boyle and ronnie my legs i dont need them
luke willson
this might be the best time to move boykin to te and either activate dez or sign some other wr dude from the flea market
trade deadline was nov 3
can mark ingram just sit back i love him hes great for the locker room chemistry but gus edwards and jk are bringing much more juice they are looking a lot better than mark
im all for seeing less of mark and more of jk i really can see gus and jk like mark and alvin in no i love jk though he just brings such a dynamic to the offense when hes on the field

on another note this has to be marks last season in a ravens uniform is it not
only really sure about one thing regarding the rbs wtf is hill doing in the game on consecutive plays when it is 2nd and 3rd and goal in a 77 game
im team gus with spells by jk
honestly idgaf who gets the carries but in a game dialed up to just run the damn ball lamar leads the team in carries with 11

lamar 11 carries gus 7 jk ingram 5 each how is that enough especially when jk gus are so good the strength of this team is in our running backs and theyre mostly just blockers and spectators right now
the fact that our 4th string rb was ever on the field is an indictment of roman the fact that we ran a direct snap to our 3rd string rb on a 4th down play we really needed also gus and dobbins are clearly our best rb options so why are we ever taking them off the field
he was making some plays last week and i was surprised he wasnt starting tonight great freaking play
dude is just as fast as patrick queen hes playing a great game
now we need the offense to have a great drive

get this outta here man this is unnecessary
thats his season it looks like rest up boyle
holy fuck
just dm me if u do thanks
removed

fuck him

hes playing like shit and is costing us on big plays
get him out i understand its wet but that ball didnt even get off the ground that is absurd and not acceptable flat out
my god hes been terrible last week it was rationalized as being a cut on his hand has he been this bad all season and we just didnt notice or you think its tied to him getting worried about blocking since stanley went out or actually his hand
and replace him with
2 minute drill incoming
do you understand how thin our offensive line is now we dont have the luxury of benching starters mekari took over for fluker at rt meaning nobody else on the team has experience at center
i didnt realize yanda also snapped the ball for skura last year
do you see how much its raining
dude just lost us the game
wtf
maybe they shouldnt use so much shotgun and pistol if the guy cant snap the ball
hes gonna be questionable until that cut on his hand heals
do you see how much its raining game isnt over
soulja my ass
this whole thread is toxic lately
fuck skura
matt slurra
lmao this sub is worse

yea saved us time
thats what im thinkingsecond straight year in a row with a really smart football play in the waning moments of a gamehe did something similar in the bills game last year
i think so actually smart given that they would picked it up anyways
dude is the smartest player on the field high iq well coached
very smart on his part
not 100 certain but if so not sure why you take the timeout beforehand
everyone can say what they want about how bad the refs are but thats not the problem its the mental mistakes that kill us bad snap offside dropped passes 5050 with rain we cant stop tripping over ourselves if no gears are shifted after this game besides hollywood bitching about his targets ill be tight we need to change
edit to the people that downvote me your not true fans and think lamar is the problem
hollywood better stop bitching until he gets an inch of separation
bozeman okay hand placement 9999 wouldnt get called for holding last drivekilling penalty
harry holds peters to the point where he needs his jersey fixed nothing to see here
our main issue has always been us getting into our own way

even before lamar i remember several games where we lost because of stupid penalties andor decisions even when we controlled the game for most of the 60 minutes

seems were experts in shooting ourselves in the foot
why are we throwing 30 times in a monsoon with the rushing attack we have
pat queen looking lost in coverage was the most frustrating thing for me
how about being too goddamn sloppy in maturity how da fuck do you go after the returner and fucking hit him when he clearly called a fairfucking catch


i fucking hate playing in new england you have to beat the refs first
this is pathetic guys refs didnt fuck us over even if it wasnt first down they wouldve converted on 4th ice up guys we lost to a sub mediocre team thats not on refs
theyre not cheating man its just a bad spot enough with the conspiracy shit
while i agree you should look up parallax effect
the problem with this is that i cant even blame the refs for this these plays are near impossible to eyeball even with the benefit of replay im not convinced he made it or not how can you truly tell
youre in our sub guy wont see me in yours yea this is where you vent
refs arent cheating theyre doing their jobs which is fixing games for the nfl and their mob sponsors in vegas

when it rains it pours
that was ridiculous i was king of hoping lamar could take advantage of the wet ground but it just wasnt happening tonight

oh man lamar looks pissed
fuck
coaches inability to adjust to the weather and replace skura cost us this game hes hurt and its raining we cant play in the pistolshotgun if every snap is far right or left
team let lamar down media will spin this into lamar big game bad

fuck that this game was not on lamar
im usually not into the blame game but skura was horrific tonight
were now tied with cleveland and face the titans and steelers the next two weeks buckle up friends this season is suddenly very much on the edge
if anything i just hope this game proves to non ravens fans that lamar is really working with nothing a banged up and terrible o line an o coordinator who goes away from the gameplan and receivers who cant catch much less run routes the only real mistake he made was that pick at the end of the half where he tried to force it to a whiny receiver who refuses to play physical
why dont we have any fucking under center plays
if hollywood is so fast why does he never have separation
skura blame of the game
well at least were ravens fans
that rain was unreal
fuck it might as well throw dez out there to see what he can do
sucks we lost but im interested to see what changes we make prior to the titans game go ravens
i honestly think we win that game if skura knew how toyou knowdo his job
this team needs to find its reason
as a fan we should be just be worried about making the playoffs the division is shot at this point and we are nowhere near favorites
i dont want to hear the lamar slander today he did his freaking part in the monsoon the defense gave up like 200 rushing yards and special shout out to the o line and wrs for no help fucks sake lamar cant carry 21 other people
everyones injured skura sucks our recievers are awful roman is awful and we lost the 20 point streak

time to never go back to rnfl
broke our 20 point and turnover streaks we get 1 turnover and we likely break 20 and win

this team is exactly what their record says they are and theyre really badly injured to boot

if i never see that boyle injury again its too soon
okay that ref moving his foot and giving them that first down changed his own call is the most blatant fucking thing ive ever seen
1 holy fuck the rain

2 holy fuck greg roman

3 holy fuck are we in trouble


edit 4 holy fuck matt skura
what does greg roman have against gus edwards seriously only 7 carries in terrible weather makes no sense to me
one positive is derek wolfe played with a lot of heart hes not supposed to be the defensive line anchor and he played a damn good game tonight with campbell and williams out
skura really killed us tonight
mix of greg roman and skura with a dash of mother nature the wildcat 4th down playcalling that doesnt make sense and then the god awful snaps buried us but the torrential downpour on the final drive was the icing on the cake on to next week
the discipline on this team is nonexistent for three weeks in a row players racking up penalties is a major reason were in this slump also greg romans shit play calling
tbh going into the playoffs with reason to be pissed off is probably better for the team in the long run
i feel really bad for lamar right now he played a good game today and this loss will be spun as a loss due to him rather than those around him especially with how hes been getting bashed this past week
all i know is pain
takeaways from this game

we are not super bowl contenders this year injuries and we dont have the offensive depth

lamar is good everyone chill out

matt skura no good

we need to pay up for a top wide receiver we are no good at drafting and developing wrs
im embarrassed to look at the division standings
cool not only did we lose the game but we lost our best te

anyway id rather not make the playoffs playing like this and spare us the embarrassment
hollywood has a big fucking ego for a guy who couldnt hold his cousins jock strap
replace sakura but overall just a bad performance from the team overall
fuck skura
patrick queen had a pretty bad game from what i saw

hes a rookie though and missing have his starting dl understandable
what a bust i had such high expectations for this game honestly expected to win big sucks to be wrong
if you still defend greg roman youre an idiot

weve lost too many winnable games we need to stop beating ourselves
skura gets the blame in this thread also
skura had six snaps that came out sideways
well that fucking sucked
fucking pouring up there
hope lamar doesnt beat himself up too bad over a game that was out of his control
im still pissed at the fucking wildcat call
you can only play the teams on your schedule but our wins have come against teams who combine for a record of 21312 the losses come against teams who combine for 206

this is going to be a 106 team that squeezes into the postseason only to be knocked out in the wild card round for the third year in a row i dont see how anyone who has watched the last seven games can really think otherwise i would put 10 teams ahead of us in the league power rankings
my thoughts on 15s performance tonight

whats the point of using souljas when theyre shit always
walk on through the wind
walk on through the rain
though your dreams be tossed and blown
walk on walk on
with hope in your heart
and youll never walk alone

on to tennessee lamar was a warrior who wasnt helped by the conditions this is football lets walk on
lamar played really great imo bar the one poor choice at the end of the half that lead to the int

i would have really liked to have seen that final drive not be in an monsoon but skura really kicked us in the teeth on the previous one when it looked like we were rolling but we didnt wake up in time and the conditions just got worse and worse

brown is not a no 1 receiver in this league yet we still need a lot of help on the outside and as much as the dez story is feel good he aint it we need to spend money and make trades for offensive weapons like we do for defensive ones

absolutely fucking pathetic
mediocre offense mediocre defense this iteration of the team reminds me of the 2016 2017 ravens
i hate for us to lose but this is who we are i like the position we in a team thats in the race for the wild card hungry all the fake love we get in the media they can keep it ravens vs everybody
another week of avoiding rnfl and anything related to football in general which will probably turn into 2 more weeks when we lose to the titans and steelers
this team looks so unprepared week in and week out probably the most unprepared and undisciplined theyve ever looked in the harbaugh era
nick boyle died for this
outsider here why did they keep lining up lamar at shotgun if they knew skura couldnt snap the ball properly
john harbaugh said that te nick boyle has a major knee injury and is out for the season jeffzrebiec
john harbaugh attributed the bad snaps to the rainy weather in foxborough jamisonhensley
im also trying to figure out why it took so long for wink to get more aggressive on defense after we got the game to within a score he really turned up the pressure and the patriots running game was pretty much stopped

why not make that adjustment earlier when we are getting gashed play after play
we aint that good peeps
im no newfan and i know life is pain but fuck the magic is gone from this season
you guys will be fine they only won because of the rain keep your chins up

lol john is always so catty after a loss jamison or someone asks about the impact of injuries and hes like what do you want like a percentage
fucking rain
shit happens everything went the wrong way for us this game we need bwill or campbell to be back still 63
well fuck we had a chance but skura fucked us hard bad snaps all game long plus those 2 times at 4th and 1 and at that 2nd and 5 which killed our momentum if someone really tries to put that one on lamar then just stfu please just stfu
well that was a waste of 3 hours
why didnt we run more in the 4th when gus was averaging like 6ypc
everytime lamar made a play it was canceled out by a penalty a terrible snap or a drop and i could have ran for 100 yds on that run d
ill remind everyone that was the 31st ranked defense in the league our offense is a mess
why the hell did it only rain hard when the ravens had the ball

god hates us
probably the most disappointing game even more than kc that team is not good no im not convinced that they are still but bill is and we got fucking pushed around
well at least were not 45 but were headed toward 97
someone needs to shove a pineapple wrapped in sandpaper up skuras ass
honestly what did we learn from a loss in a monsoon with key defensive players missing

yes this team has a lot of problems but it may be as simple as the ravens are losing the coin flip games they won last year they should have wonhad a very good opportunity to win both this one and the pittsburgh game and it didnt work out sometimes that happens and its yet another reason why last years failure is the worst in franchise history sure it sucks and it really sucks when your division rival wins all the coin flip games but tonight was just a fluke loss to a bad team in terrible weather it happens
defense really stepped up at the end so that makes me feel better
less than a minute left backed up and need to get down the field time to dig into the well and pull out all the stops the call a 2 yard out to willie snead with 160 lb hollywood as the only lead blocker
everyone raved about his weight gain and speed he looks exactly the same if not slower and more out of sorts i wouldnt throw a ball toward you if the ball is constantly getting picked when youre near it
greg roman his wasting lamars talent this cant go on
while lamar certainly deserves his share of blame for other games this season this game isnt one of them

he threw two bad passes all game and made one additional bad decision not running for the first down on second and 12 considering how awful his receivers and oline is and considering how bad the conditions were i think he played very well considering
literally every person weve given a big contract to this year has gotten hurt literally cursed
i still think we sneak into the playoffs but obviously the expectations for this team vs reality are vastly different

steelers are the clear favorite in this division but to be very blunt they arent that good either shouldve lost to the eagles cowboys us theyve benefitted from some timely penalties in those games

if anyone saw urban meyers message over the weekend about under performing teams it 100 applies to us i encourage all raven fans to take a listen we dont have bad players we have elite players the team itself isnt elite we need to look under the hood
after having time to decompress and think i can finally give yall my level headed assessment of the game

1 i initially thought that lamar threw a poor ball on his int to jc jackson i still do but now understand why he did it lamar threw it w a low trajectory on hollywoods inside shoulder hoping that hollywood would stack the db and control the pace of the route he threw it while jackson hollywood were even in their routes he basically tried to throw a ball that hollywood could catch in stride that turned into an int partly because hollywood failed to stack jc jackson the exact same thing happened on the ravens first deep sideline shot between lamarhollywood jackson basically pushed hollywood out of bounds on that one the difference there was that jc didnt play the ball lamar trusted hollywood to beat jc both times and hollywood didnt going forward lamar will need to target hollywoods outside shoulder on deep shots unless he has clearly won in the route
2 hollywood is a super slot at this stage over the past 2 wks he has been bullied by bigger corners jc jackson xavier rhodes failing to stack jc jackson today was pretty concerning imo perriman had no problems stacking jc jackson and beating him last wk he had jc jackson in hell all game unfortunately jc had hollywood in jail today
3 referring to point 1 miles boykin would probably sell his soul for the 2 deep opportunities hollywood got today miles hasnt been thrown a catchable 9 route since the freaking rams game last yr that was rg3 throwing to him next time lamar decides to attack a 1v1 deep sideline iso he needs to do so with boykin even if boykin doesnt win he has the size and catch radius to go up and fight for the ball in that scenario give him something catchable and lets see what he can do
4 lamar overthrew hollywood in the rz but there was a reason for that the play in question contained a hard play fake movement to the left which led to lamars mechanics breaking down same thing happened on his high incompletion to snead in the 3rd or 4th q he scrambled to the left failed to reset properly and short armed the ball which is why it sailed he needs to practice that going forward wo movement we saw lamar hit boykin on a similar route vs the steelers for a td
5 lamar wasnt without fault in this game considering my viewpoint of his int i believe he made 1 egregious mistake that was all on him he tried to throw to hollywood over the middle when the pats had 9 in coverage and flooded the middle of the field the int was dropped because of the rain
6 all things considered i thought lamar played well i thought he threw the ball well especially in the rain weve never seen him have a big throwing game in rainy weather until today i thought he made good decisions for the most part
7 skura had a rough game but i wont put it all on him the game was being played in a rainstorm especially in the 2nd half skura had clear snap issues last wk in a dome as a coach how do you not adjust to that either replace him w mekari or line up under center thats the problem w roman imo when he sees a player struggling he doesnt do much to help that player schematically
8 the loss of nick boyle for the season is freaking massive other than lamar hes was the most important player on our offense i hope he recovers because that looked nasty id like to point out that andrews dropped a ball in the 4th q because he was looking behind him anticipating a kill shot the boyle injury affected andrews
9 dj fluker isnt a passable rt the pats have a terrible front 7 and still owned him
10 patrick queen is a total diaster in coverage im at the point where i dont believe he should be in on obvious passing downs let him figure it out in practice while board or levine come in to fill the role
11 snead is our wr1 on one hand yikes on the other hand i like that a veteran wr like snead has chemistry with lamar the young receivers on our team can learn from him and also be available to lamar on the field specifically proche and duvernay
12 ngakoue is a good player but holds little value on our team atm we blitz like crazy on passing downs as it is which limits an edge like him in the first place he offers very little in the run game its early but i dont see the ravens paying him next yr i see them letting him walk
13 the pats made a concerted effort to attack marcus peters in the passing game oddly enough peters was monstrous in run support weird

my overarching point is this this offense was the lamar show today and will be the lamar show x2 going forward at this point the ravens need to move dez into the active 53 duvernay looks promising and needs more targets hollywood needs to be schemed open better because he isnt a 1v1 winner especially against bigger corners

defensively i hope williams can play next week if not henry is going to go for 200 yards
the one thing i learned from this game is lamar needs more from his offense he was delivering balls consistently to his recievers and getting the job done but bad o line play and bad wr play cost us the game pretty much also im not worried abt the defense considering the reason y they were getting run over was bc of injuries and in the end they tightened up and got us two three and outs and another stop after that too basically g ro needs to do better w his pass concepts and we need skura to snap the ball right also is it too much to ask for a wr1 snead is out best reciever and i feel like he should be a good wr3 w holly wood a wr2 and then we need someone for wr1
we need a other wr asap im fucking done with hollywood downvote me all you want but man he isnt nfl wr material
can matt birk still play
yes weather sucks but new england also had to deal with it not like it turned into dry and sunshine when they took the field

cant blame the weather folks deal with it we just werent good enough period
cut skura
this team is playing like they actually won something last year the constant mental errors lack of urgency and just plain sluggishness is something youd expect from a team on a championship hangover not the team who was supposed to come in with a chip on its shoulder and desperation to go far i didnt expect another 142 season but what i thought wed get is pure hunger i said it after the steelers game as well too many of these guys are soft well beat up on teams when they let us but the second we get punched in the mouth were flattened in 2012 we played like shit sometimes but those guys were desperate to win 4th and 29 check down and you had receivers levelling lbs to get us the first down dont see that same will to win in this team
some things i think

1 patrick queen aint nearly as bad as you all think hes played well for most of the season and hes a rookie hes going to make mistakes he was in position for that trick play and just didnt turn around fast enough it was a good throw

2 its been like this for years but turnovers paper over a lot of holes in this d baltimore almost never wins games when they lose the turnover battle

3 boyles injury is just as impactful as stanleys a lot of our offense depends on multiple te sets and losing him is going to be killer

4 its too early to call hollywood a bust but his lack of separation is a major problem given his height and physicality issues if he cant run crisp routes andor blow by people he cant play in this league they need to find ways to get him in the slot or run drags

5 despite all the problems this team could have easily won this game and the pittsburgh game some of this is just bad luck that will hopefully start to even out

6 greg roman isnt in the top 5 of things wrong with this team yeah he makes some baffling choices like using justice hill and doing direct snaps on 4th and 1 but he also calls a hell of a lot of well designed and effective plays cant just focus on the negative his offense helped lamar win the mvp cant jettison him now because of a combination of injuries and regression

7 offense has scored 34 points in the last two weeks combined 34 in one game would have been a bad showing last year

8 its weird how little i care about the pats now that brady is gone just another team now

9 every loss this season makes blowing the 142 year sting more and more
fuck this season man
really awful first half and bad but not as awful second half
pain
this fucking team
can we kick the tires on elflien
injuries skura the rain not one redeeming thing about this game lamar cant do it alone and we are fielding practice squad players as starters i dont see us getting any healthier soon
please fire roman for the love of god
the rain sucked but with all those injuries we are not contenders
how come no late hit penalty when lamar jumped on skuras shitty snap clearly lamar landed and had control of the ball and he gets a pats player jumping on him
i dont defend or accuse roman but the play call at the end of the game with andrews screen is not helpful lets have the small man hollywood be andrews lead blocker in that situation or any why
lamar played well tonight the offence showed some life the defense showed up too late though and our center is problem im not giving up on a wild card playoff storyline lets go ravens
we took hollywood over dk
what a god damn letdown injuries and freaking monsoon aside this team should be losing to a team with no playmakers we all know the pats are gonna run the ball except wink i guess for those last two series just inexcusable could be a make or break game for us next week
the pats looked like dogshit against the fucking jets last week they shouldve lost this loss is disgusting
disgusting effort overall
its coaching peopledont get me wrong penalties dropped passes and injuries didnt help but someone explain to me why were not using gus edwards
skura was born in pittsburgh that says it all
we got super lucky last year with injuries this year not so much
that was a terrible loss especially hate being a ravens fan from boston
what can i say they didnt deserve to win tonight lol lamar played one of his best games of the year but the rest of the team kinda let him down

also tf skura bro gotta dip his hand in some aloe tonight smh
can someone teach skura how to snap a football pretty please
this game turned when it was 77 we were moving the ball at will and had 1st and goal from the 9 the next three pass play calls were mind boggling and we ended up only getting 3 ne took the lead after that and greg roman blew our mind the rest of the night good coaches stay with what works until the other team proves they can stop it stop over thinking roman
harbaugh said that hell know more about brandon williams and terrell bonds status tomorrow jeffzrebiec
does it make anybody else sad that we lost two big streaks the games in a row with a turnover and games in a row with 20 points
ingram and dobbins 13 touches 43 yards
gus 8 for 73 the bus doesnt need an oline jk and ingram shoulda stayed dry on the team bus with that
we arentwho we thought we were


injuries and horrid play calling doesnt help
was there not a blatant hold on peters on that 2nd down newton run late it would have backed them up big time and we prob get the ball back instead they tried to throw a flag in us for unnecessary roughness lmao peters was held so blatantly and not a glance from the refs
we have 2 lineman other than skura with experience at center and we let him screw up snaps for multiple weeks every single possible way of looking at it shows that edwards and dobbins are more effective than ingram but were still giving ingram equal or more snaps no receiver can get yac but duvernay who rarely sees the field we have no idea what our best line is and that would be true even if stanley stayed healthy we thrived on two tes last year but didnt bring in a hurst replacement and instead tried to shoehorn a player whose skill set is not that of a te into the spot

point is yes roman in game play calling wise has left some room for criticism but you have to look at some of the decisions being made on a personnel level too here we arent in a place to succeed before roman even starts working on it
weather sucked being down 2 pro bowl o linemen this year sucks expectations of 2 second year wide receivers and a journey man becoming elite pro bowl targets was bold to say the least hopefully dez can step up and give this team the fire they need to ignite remember back in 2012 after the texans whooped our asses and we lost ray how did that season turn out we got this just gotta lets old school ravens football go to work
browns fan if only the bengals had beaten the steelers today would be a great day for everyone even raven fans would be able to smile however a dark day is coming yinzer nation is rising their cockiness is getting overwhelming but its not stopping them god help us all
i miss yanda
lamar has no weapons
i dont care if this is emotional every draft pick from round 1 to 3 needs to be wr
remember when we had receivers like mark clayton derrick mason and anquan boldin jacoby jones torrey smith to throw to

yep i remember those days
whole team was garbage shitty everyone
lots of failures but my man skura really fucked up bad
fuck skura
youre gonna need to pay for pornhub premium to watch derrick henry daddydick this team next week
so was that not a blatant hold on peters on that newton scramble on 2nd down the one where they tried to give us a flag instead looked obvious as hell never saw a replay really
people on espn will go on air tomorrow and continue to blame lamar and say he cant play from behind even though he played in a ducking hurricane tonight fuck the rain fuck the patriots bring on the titans dont panic folks we still get to play the cowboys jaguars giants and bengals down the stretch
was ngakoue even playing i dont think i heard his name once all game
sounding the alarm on patrick queen dude cant tackle and he sucks in coverage
skura has to go
lamar played his heart out this dude did everything he could unfortunately his team did him no favors today

receivers dropped on target throws consistently throughout the night the center needs to be replaced because this is consistent bad snap play and it keeps killing the offenses momentum no matter how hard lamar tries to resuscitate it

hopefully we whoop the titans next week to get back on track
wtf bro
incredible
cunt
penalties killed any chances
not our year thats all it is only thing i am holding on to is the stat that last time we won both super bowls we started 52
obviously im frustrated by how we played but theres just no winning with the weather on that final drive that sucked
how many guys did we lose in that monsoon of a game
i dont know if it helps but belichek cant beat us without trick plays
this team is fraudulent good but not good enough
on the bright side i have derrick henry on my fantasy team
fuck
skura fam
fucking pain
does this mean the madden curse is real
hollywood stat line 2 catches 14 yards
when it rains it fuckin pours
trash
what a fucking embarrassment
lamar was really mad
i hate everything
honestly considering the conditions and the fact that aome of our best run defenders had injuries im upset but idk im not blaming the team as much as i normally do idk why im normally in here venting like a morherfucker i will say that this team is playing uncharacterisically undisciplined its week 9 we shouldnt be making the mistakes we are making on offense defense is always a toss up but holy shit the offense is sloppy
injuries drops bland playcalling skura
this game shaved years off my life
its time to face reality that the current baltimore ravens are a good team with serious deficiencies we should be happy to even make the playoffs this year we can beat up bad teams with poor coaching but we are going to run into a brick wall come the playoffs when all of the bad teams have been eliminated
i think we need to utilize more formations than just pistol when its pouring that hard i dont mean wildcat either roman
time to start purging
wonderful i just hope nick boyle is okay
rip nick boyle and rip ravens playoff chances
they beat us we shot ourselves in the foot we had injuries that we didnt really adapt to until it was too late they made more creative plays they beat us

it happens its not the end of the world its just football

think this team still has enough talent to put it together but im growing less optimistic about that

fans need to chill the fuck out though its only game
i still cant believe this team wants our permanent offense to be whatever shitshow roman is putting out there he needs to be ousted
well that fucking sucked oh well on to the next game
lamar had one of if not his best games but the o line dline and the rain said nah
man i fucking feel for lamar
look at the rain settle down after the ravens drive lol
hmmm lets see dropped passes bad snaps certain times lamar had time to throw but nobody was open no one to high point a ball injuries penalties outplayed and out coached everyone made horrible decisions today total team effort in this loss
skura is a cuck roman has a micro pp thats about all i have to say
only got to catch bits and pieces but i felt like every time i did watch there was a penalty on someone the discipline on this team is nothing like it was last season
this was a game we should have won but god that boyle injury is sickening to watch first young then stanley now boyle rough year for season enders
theres always next year guys
i thought skuras problems were because of his cut on his hand but it seems to be more than that or is he just super unlucky
pretty clear that with williams out was the clear factor the ravens lost this game the play calling wasnt terrible but you cant expect to win games when your starters are dropping left and right not sure how they win the next two games lamar is gonna have to be spectacular i really dont know if thats possible right now with the ol as it is
whenever the ravens lose this bad it makes me want to get madden and go to town on the other team and i dont even have a gaming console these terrible losses make me consider dropping 300
i realize that we have been undisciplined at times but our opponents have only been called for 10 penalties the last 4 games they mentioned that ne is on historically low pace for penalties at roughly 3 per game so its a little fluky to me that our combined opponents are averaging 25 per game lately

overall i think between injuries and statistical regression and frankly some bad luck were in a bit of a funk typical for harbaugh teams this time of year i hope we come out on fire in december at least
i cant recall ever seeing both sides on the line that badly mangled before we did not have a competitive unit to field by the end of this game
why does our defense go to shit everytime bwill gets hurt like clockwork nasty deranged clockwork
my biggest takeaways from the last game and a half is that lamar is working his way back to where he was last year he was great after halftime against the colts and given the situation he was dealing with tonight pretty incredible
run d skura and that refs horrible fucking spot of the ball are to blame for this loss
im entirely convinced roman does not have a 2 minute drill play book the offense needs to be revamped this offseason in a big way the oline killed us not to mention snead is our 1 wr we desperately need to sign someone
63 teams right now mitchgoldich


afc 4th through 9th place teams colts ravens raiders dolphins browns titans

nfc west top 3 cardinals rams seahawks

thats 932 more than a quarter of the league
the worst part about the losses and close wins is nothing changes the next week
this has been a really painful season to watch i keep thinking the coaching staff will make changes but they keep thinking the same approach will work
it is time to wash my lucky ravens gear
god help anyone who expects patrick queen to help us against derrick henry

bajema vs supernaw
trade for allen robinsons
not gonna lie there were a surprising number of drops by the receiving corps that game
defense started bad but got tough for most of the second half man takeaway could have made the difference heads up play to take the penalty with 240 left otherwise i dont think we get the ball back

offense moved the ball ok but mistakes killed them throughout the game left at least 3 points on the field interception bad snaps drops and penalties killed several other drives just sloppy bullshit despite all that we had a chance at the end but mother nature was not on our side
for the first time i really saw on lamars face his frustration with the offense
cut skura now
wtf is the point of investing in the defense if it gets exposed this easily millions of dollars for nothing if big baby gets rolled upor mahomes carving our secondary trading for campbell is nice but buf az are trading for star wrs look at how theyre playing getting rid of hurst and not replacing him ricard as a te3 is bad is also bad
im not like most fans i dont start clamouring for someone to be fired the moment shit isnt perfect i just dont ha r that emotional response in me

but for gods sake why did they not go more up tempo after the success they had last week

i love boyle sucks he got hurtand while i dont think it will happeni hope it leads to them using 10 11 personnel
good game guys hopefully we get a chance to rematch in the playoffs
my recording fucked up so i missed the second half seems like i should be thanking it
anyone know why we didnt sign mbc looks like hes not causing a bunch of distractions in tampa like this sub told me hed cause
not sure we fully appreciate how big a loss boyle is one of the biggest reasons were struggling on offense is the lack of a three te package like we had last year now were down to one
remember how we drafted hollywood in the first round ugh
so beating a 52 team is not a big game but losing to a 35 team is media logic
lamar jackson had his centers back when asked about the bad snaps the ball just was just wet couldnt do nothing about it he was trying to the best to his ability i was trying with him but things happen especially in conditions like this sgellison
we arent half as good of a football team as we were last year
the injuries are a longterm problem at this point the run game is depleted without stanley and boyle not to mention yanda gone the run defense is in shambles until campbellwilliams are fully healthy the only chance of beating good teams is lamar playing toplevel even with the run game being more good than great it can happen but its a lot to ask
ab doesnt sound too bad now
wr coach needs to be fired yesterday
ya know you just have to wonder if the pats turned on the sprinklers in that last 4th quarter drive dave from salisbury
im at a lose of words rn
i have never seen a team like this ravens team in my life

they can bully you and suffocate you into submission when leading and when trailing they have absolutely no firepower to be able to come from behind
the ravens are supposed to be this talented genius juggernaut innovative offense yet these guys are playing like they are a tanking 17 team one of the most mentally weak squads i have ever seen ffs
can someone explain why they didnt just call a wildcat formation with 2 seconds left and try to force ot i know the chances are super slim but why not go for it
skura needs to be moved to guard if not benched outright coming into the game he ranked 30th out of 38 qualifying centers in pff grade 21st in pass blocking grade and 34th in run blocking grade i thought he deserved to be benched weeks ago but after 23 straight weeks of horrific snaps he deserves to lose his job immediately outside of his 2 bad snaps that cost us big time tonight the consistently inaccurate snaps are killing us its hard to be efficient and find any type of rhythm when the play starts off that way it seems like they didnt hesitate to pull fluker so i have no idea why they chose to keep skura in the entire game harbaugh needs to figure it out theres no excuse at this level
fuuuuck i really really yanda
patrick queen got absolutely schooled by rex burkhead i mean come on offensive line play is never perfect but matt skura has consistently given reasons to be replaced injuries bad offensive play calling and no help from wrs always seem to be issues for us but i cannot handle how undisciplined we are a harbaugh team should not be getting so many penalties weekly

x200b

other than the int lamar had a great game he kept us in the game even if it does not seem that way especially when you consider all the shit going on around him
cant wait for gmfb skieuuuuuuuuup sas and kellerman to rip into lamar today for no fucking reason

fuck talking heads
greg roman gotta go
hollywood need to get separation from the secondary seems like he always tightly covered cus he cant get any yacif dez has anything left we need to put him out there otherwise we signed him for nothing the defense got embarrassed out coaches and out classes they gotta get back to stopping the run and forcing turnovers or we might as well start looking towards next year
ravens get got a lot
watching hopkins and diggs go off yesterday just makes me mad ravens need to get lamar some actual help on offense hollywood just isnt dominant enough to be a wr1
im tired of having shitty receivers year after year after year after year after year after fucking year
hope you all do not mind i bleed blue but wear a ravens tshirt

i know all the talk is offense on most reddit of late lamar snaps wr play oc roman and so on

the glaring thing to me yesterday was lb play every run of 5 yards seemed to me that lb or dl is hitting the wrong gap too many times i am seeing the lb behind dl stacked before the rb hits the hole
if only we had murray wed win the super bowl
ravens need to win all 7 games this is ridiculous
lamar played as good as one could hope in that weather skurainjuries booming us
fuck greg roman
were injured our oc sucks and we dont have the playmakers on offense outside of lamar really we might be lucky to make the playoffs
the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result i dont know if this best describes john harbaugh greg roman or myself but its at least 23
unpopular take but getting consistent snaps in a monsoon is hard wet ball hard to grip for snapping not saying its not skuras fault but with how the snaps were going at some point roman shouldve put us in an under center formation like how the patriots were running
is allen robinson a fa we should go after him
we were just too focused on the upcoming titans and steelers games

my biggest issue with this game was without a doubt the weather that was not normal by any means and it clearly benefitted the team that got the least beat up in the trenches no campbell and losing williams got us gashed the first half and into the 3rd and then the weather just completely took over and immobilized both offenses in the 4th overall just a night to forget

man this team is not just beat up right now but straight up gashed with these last two huge season ending injuriesstanley and boyle having guys like b will jimmy smith campbell and fort able to come back in a few weeks will be huge in getting this team back on track for the final stretch of games vs dal cle jac nyg and cin season isnt over and i think the mindset for the team is get into the wc spot and try just go for it and see what happens what do we have to lose

lamar has come a long way and im proud of how hes faced adversity these last two weeks team as a whole needs to get better and some of our offensive weapons need to work out their issues and start making plays again patrick queen has been awesome in general but its clear hes still a rookie and he can only go up from here harbs has some serious sole searching to do regarding roman being with the team next year and how to patch work together and offensive line this year to try and make some sort of playoff push

my guess for final win count is 115 and a middle wc spot where we may have a shot at taking on ind buf or mia on the road and thats huge for us
lamar played great minus the pick team let him down coaching sucked first half refs shit on us too idk game felt rigged
madden curse can fuck off
just an interesting fact ravens are 60 when they have the superior coach 03 in games when they have the inferior coach
oh well we can still go 133
fire greg roman what was that last drive
were crashing and burning well be lucky to go 97 with all the injuries and shitty play calling
madden curse
drinking champagne in spain the cham and s are silent
we are going to get killed by derrick henry next week our run stoppers are hurt offense isnt clicking lamar making terrible reads not running when there is space this whole season is making me hurt and we are fucking 63 fix this shit
lamar wasnt good but he definitely didnt lose us this game
seasons chalked too many injuries
fucking pussy quitters gave up unreal
i put money on ravens and bills winning today think im cursed and done with bets 500 lesson
just missed out on over 1500 over ravens losing by more than 3 jesus christ the bad snaps were unbelievable and at such crucial moments thanks ravens

the lamar jackson experiment was nice but unless he can show significant improvements in his passing it would be dumb to pay him a lot of money

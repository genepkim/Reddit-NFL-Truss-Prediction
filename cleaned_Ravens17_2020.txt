i dont hate the idea but i dont think its likely hell be in our price range i think the most likely destination for him is whoever hires saleh as a hc apparently theyre very close maybe detroit where hed be able to mentor okudah
id love it hes my top 5 favorite players of all time the problem is that hes too expensive most likely if he converted to safety i would be sooooo happy
i just dont see it
hes probably gonna be too much money would rather draft a young cb considering peters aint getting younger jimmy is probably done after this season and beyond that we dont got much else outside of perhaps one last chance for tavon young before he gets cut
he cost to much tbh
sherman hates jim harbaugh with an extreme passion i doubt he wants to be on his brothers squad i realize jim and john are different but the hatred really runs deep
i think we should go for him and ask him to convert to safety hes a great player but hes not fast enough for some of these wr nowadays
probably too expensive but it wouldnt be the first time a older vet signed for cheap to play in baltimore he probably wouldnt be a cb anymore though i think hes smart enough to play safety
we need man corners sherman made a living as a cover 3 zone guy hofer dont get me wrong just dont see the fit for the price he will want at his age
i thought richard and john harbaugh got into a pretty heated argument last season
he be awesome to have but were pretty set with hump peters jimmy tavon yes ik 2 are super injury prone but there my boys

do you buy single cards or packs
saw this on rfootballcards thats a nice collection still trying to track down a dobbins auto for myself this year ive got ravens in a break tonight so im hoping he pops up
thats a beautiful mosaic rainbow youve got going there whats the lowest print you have packer cards 87 on youtube is building the jordy nelson mosaic rainbow if you wanted to see how yours stacks up lol
im actually shocked they still make sports cards
wanna hear something hilarious

i did the same thing years ago withmark clayton

shoot me
yooo i wanna get into football cards and eventually start buying those mad expensive panini boxes

how many different cards for each player are released each year

wait why arent they all naked
thats the hot tub in browns stadium

doesnt baker mayfield have a commercial there

actually this is candid camera
couldnt resist

yes if we win and browns win all 3 make playoffs i think if colts lose then browns can make it as well
removed
what say you

i mean he gave a good speech but all its going to do is get him out of houston which is probably the point
regardless of his opinion i found myself pretty intrigued that he along with id assume a lot of other pro athletes would feel this type of way about him airing dirty laundry goes along way helping his view with the fans hurts the way other nflers look at him

when i first heard this speech i was like right on jj now when judon posts this it makes you wonder what athletes think of jj behind closed doors

there were people on here yesterday saying they would love jj on our team
holy shit i completely agree with judon this irked while listening and i fucking cringed

people do their job and sometimes youre not good or strong enough no matter how hard you work yamcha could work out everyday and would never beat krillin lol
you dont throw your guys under the bus you back your guys publicly and privately tell them to shape up

look at playersattached folks applauding watt headhunting pos who washed out of the league the wivesgirlfriends of perennially underperforming qbs brotherfucker etc

watt is the guy who narcs to the boss when you start talking about unionizing watt is the guy who complains that nobody else is working hard enough while having the easiest job on the floor
i heard those comments and i was irked because there was no way anyone on that team was quitting

we as ravens fans have a few words for watt

nobody cares work harder
this is pretty rich from jj who got a big fat contract despite sitting at home and watch like half of his games in the last 5 seasons

one day you give everything to the team the next day you are on the street begging to be signed dez bryant for example
bull of shit
i think what he said was fine he didnt refer to anyone by name and he has sacrificed a lot for a team that has wasted his generational talent he should come to the ravens
watts speech reminded me of bakers speech baker did a very similar thing sunday he said what the media thought he should say he even said shame on you to the people blaming the practice squad wrs for the loss absolutely no one was calling out them though that was just a way for him to show that he was being a leader and taking the blame for the loss which was on him
i mean he didnt call out anyone specifically he left it ambiguous i assume there were guys who were not putting in effort and i think watt has earned the right to be taken at face value isnt judon just doing what he acuses watt of doing but taking it to the next level by mentioning his name
i dont have instagram whats the context
i mean if judon thinks this is bs then good he isnt one of the guys watt would be preaching to i think judon is wrong though because i do think there are a ton of guys that need this said to them having the right culture attitude and motivation is key thankfully judon has had that his career
jj watt is and has always been a massive ass kisser i am sure when he is done he will run for office in texas or own a car dealership there
im so conflicted by watts speech and judons response dont really know what to make of any of it
i 100 agree jj watt is such a twat
lol crazy bc houston might be the team to pay him come summer
i like what jj said i just hope he said it to the team before the cameras
does judon have to make a cause for calling out sportsmanship virtue signaling who cares amirite i think its a little corny but there is a lot more annoying antics played up throughout the league imo
i 100 feel judon and i felt the same once i watched the jj rant yesterday its cool to the media but that shit amongst your teammates especially from a guy who hasnt had a ton of success team wise gotta feel a type of way
nah i 100 side with watt him and watson are the only decent things keeping the texans together

regardless why tf is judon acting like a teenager trying to point out that watts capping on his ig page that just seems so unnecessary
soooo safe to say a jj and judon pairing wont happen sad
im making a trip to maryland this week to visit some family for new years im not from baltimore but im a lifelong die hard fan of this team anyways i hear about this pop up shop at canton crossing from garrett downing all the time and i wanted to stop there and check it out while i was in the area my question is when is this place open and where it is exactly i tried finding it on maps but it looks like its just a construction area or parking lot or something also is there anything else worth checking out ravens themed of course ill just be passing through so i wont have much time thanks for the help in advance
the details are on the official ravens website with address hours etc
trust me as a fellow non native i have had much better luck at this place and they have way more variety with teams like the os and terps its just outside of baltimore here also super nice people if they dont have what you are looking for they will find it and ship it to you
go check out the statues in front of the bank of course
they dont have a ton of variety with jerseys mostly lamar hollywood tucker maybe some mandrews but they have some other cool gear i bought everyone in my family something from there for christmas lol plus lots of other small things like masks keychains etc


view poll
i love rg3 but hes just not good enough and too overpaid rn huntley and trace both honestly flashed potential to be a decent backup
need to see more of them both to decide huntley looked like mini lamar but had barely any playing time
i dont get the trace mcsorely hype at all
as much as i liked what i saw from huntley i just havent seen enough from either him or mcsorely for that matter
this is why we need a preseason
mcsorely huntley rgiii


mcsorely has shown poise in high leverage situations but i am open to huntley taking his job if he shows up in the preseason

rgiii gives us nothing that the other two dont and we need the cap space cutting him offers he was a great locker room guy and mentor for lamar but lamar has got it and the time has come to move on
why is this a question lol do u genuinely believe this is controversial op
so i recall last season when the ravens were rolling with the run game one of the big signs id see of it clicking was when even the cameraman was fooled at the hand off and had to double back to get the ball carrier ive noticed that seems to be happening more in the last couple of games and there are times when even watching the replay and knowing who gets the ball it still seems like it went the other way anyone else noticing this
its lamars armshe has a competitive advantage that hide the football since its close to his skin color

the nfl is putting a rule in place next year that he has to wear a white skin cover over his arms so all the other quarterbacks have a chance

what about captain insano
lamark kentson
yeah its literally impossible to have a better ratio than
the flash
not to make light of this achievement and im sure ill get downvoted but turnovers overall sure would look different which to me is the more important stat protect that ball lamar

best comment in there is a guy claiming that theyll probably do some browns thing like losing to the jets or something d
lol now we have the same record and only 1 of us lost to the jets
mid season superbowl for them funny part is they never beat us this year and all the browns fans though they were tough shit now they bitch about covid when we also took an l due to covid the browns had a shot to beat us a couple weeks ago and they wouldnt be in this scenario trash ass team
that whole thread is hilarious
i dont understand but please dont explain it to me just cleveland things i guess
we should probably all stfu until after sunday its not like the bengals are strangers to fucking us out of the playoffs in week 17
i love the guy saying he predicted with confidence that baker would win a playoff game before lamar after they were drafted so brave to predict that the 1 pick would win a playoff game before the 32 backup qb that everyone thought would suck
yall motherfuckers stop going in there in bad faith and commenting lets not stoop as low as those homegirlz
lets laugh at the comments but dont reply to them please lets not be petty

i personally hate both teams but does tonight have any implications for us
theres no implication really the records next week decide the seeding everyone kind of expects the starters to sit next week they cant get the number 1
the bills so we wont play them and play the steelers i guess idk bro

yes obviously dont brigade though guys
yikes




these porno companies just keep on pushing the limits

they only won yesterday because of those bullshit pi calls im glad it happened for baltimores sake but still does the nfl have any integrity anymore
been sayin this all szn
agreed i hate that fucking narrative
theyve been obvious frauds since like week 3 at the latest i dont think a team undefeated at the halfway point of the season has ever convinced me less that they belong
play down to competition is a ludicrous phrase repeated by morons its a pathetic excuse for simply being a trash team
they beat us twice theyre not very good right now and may be tending in the wrong direction but they arent that bad i assume there will be one million reasons why the beat us incoming
the whole nfl has been calling that bs all season to be fair
they beat us twice
the play down to opponents is the most retarded excuse ive ever heard for a team sucking

to bad skura thought he was snapping it to sam koch instead of lamar
i usually dont blame shit on the weather but i live 30 minutes from gillette there was a tornado warning nearby and without campbell and williams we got absolutely gutted in the run game
it was a monsoon
we threw the ball too much that day
this season showed how important schedule is man
yeah the loss to the pats and the first loss to the steelers are the two that piss me off
they had a weather machine seeding clouds before baltimore possessions and clearing the skies during patriots possessions and yes the technology does exist the ravens are the only afc team the patriots have been constantly competing with the past 20 years of course they are gonna pull out all the stops to make sure they get the win over us its part of the reason i think brady left and went nfc he knew there was no chance of getting back to a super bowl in the afc also why did they bring in a mobile quarterback like cam newton because thats how they felt was the only way to compete in the afc with teams like baltimore buffalo and kansas city plus matt skura really fucked us in that one without him we probably win
this l was the rock bottom of our season barring an upset next week ofc
ehh i honestly think if the weather was better we would have won skura slippery fingers did not help that game

that was the most intense rain game ive seen the ravens play in years

plus we were missing 700 pounds of dline
any given sunday it happens as long as we make the playoffs it can be easily dismissed
feel like the pats are doing a good job at running at them if we face them thats good news for us i feel like ravens got a good shot against them
i always knew they was good so im not surprised theyre playing good but its about gta time this a blow out
really yall gonna diss jj watt for speaking the truth about a sorry ass texans team you really think those boys are actually putting in effort to be that bad jj is a hofer and proven leader but yeah hes total lying about the whole thing for the cameras

im praying we trade for him and let judon sorry ass walk

theres bringing a team problem to the team and then theres throwing your teammates under the bus leaders lead instead of try to throw other guys when youre not playing up to the contract theyre paying you for
watt should have kept that shit to himself or the locker being a drama queen in front of media and throwing players under the bus in front of media is never a good look
hes too expensive plus id rather have judon tbh he has more good years left in him
nothing wrong with us watt should have kept that in the locker room hes a veteran player and a team captain should know better
i think it goes down to common games and i cant figure it out
them because of division wins
if i am getting my seeding correct we want the sixth seed so we can get another shot at the steelers
if we win none of that matters were in

yikes didnt even think about this but true

lamar good
stop it rbrowns is already dead s
if jackson has a weakness in my mind its not his passing or at least if it is his passing that is an outgrowth of his real weakness which is that he believes he has to carry the entire team when his passes go wrong its because the running game isnt working and hes in carry the whole team mode

the fact that he actually can carry the whole team way more often than anyone ive ever seen play football just reinforces that tendency in him when the plan isnt working and other players have quit on the game mentally he thinks he can just will the team to victory and hes often right but sometimes hes not and those are the games that people who criticize his passing point to

when the plan is working he passes well when hes forced into carry the team mode and having a good day he still passes well like at the end of the browns game when hes forced into carry the team mode and just having a normally suboptimal day you know like a human being thats when his passes dont work his running game usually still works in that case but if theyre behind at that point which they would have to be to get him into carry the team mode the running game isnt going to be enough and he forces passes

my football watching is limited to about 95 of all ravens games and maybe five or six other games a season also i think ray lewis and ed reed and a few other ravens stars had the same drive to carry the team but if youre playing qb that drive is magnified fivefold its hard to consistently carry the team from ray and eds positions
weirdcouldve sworn lamar was an rb
we also saw what happens when a team has some of the best running backs in football and doesnt run the ball
post this to rnfl
incoming whiny browns fans
sarah has been our best writer for years change my mind
facts
the companion piece to this is of course josh allen whos just ballin all over the place this year with our boy diggs theres clearly a lot else that goes into it but if 50 of this josh allen surge is because diggs showed up we gotta get the llama a studthough in fairness andrews is a stud
i mean ill defend lj to the end of the earth and i believe the browns have a ton of skill position talent but its a big difference between a pro bowl wr and practice squad wrs with no first team reps
put some respect on llamaaaa
while im happy for darren waller it really hurts to think about what could have been waller would have been the perfect target for lamar a huge body with a wide catch radius who you can catch any type of ball you throw to him it hurts to know we drafted him had him on the roster and he left and will probably be one of the best in the league in the next year or two
say it louder for the browns fans lurking in the back
i hate the browns as much as anybody but this tweer is pretty unfair lamar hasnt had a pro bowl wr but he has had a pro bowl te which probably suits him better than a pro bowl wr

and more importantly baker wasnt just missing his pro bowl wrs and has in fact looked better since one of them went down he was working with no wr that he had ever thrown a competitive pass to

i love my qb

meh the receivers baker mayfield had this weekend were worse than any receivers lamar has ever used theyre wildly different players when the passing game isnt working lamar can make things happen with his legs that baker and like 28 other starting qbs in the nfl just cant

but given the receivers the browns used this week its not really a fair comparison any one of brown snead boykin bryant or duvernay probably would have been the best receiver on the browns roster this past weekend its pretty deceiving to talk about how they were without pro bowl wrs when in reality those receivers werent even on an active roster a week ago its beyond just using below average wide receivers
baker had to work with practice squad receivers with little to no preparation not the same thing
lamar jackson regular season record as a starter 297 0806 winning percentage

baker mayfield regular season record as a starter 2222 0500 winning percentage

in 8 less starts lamar has 7 more wins that mayfield

head to head record as starters lamar 4 mayfield 1
i like sarah ellison
you know what guys im just gonna say it i think lamar jackson is really good
so check this out

i cant even begin to fathom what the ravens front office is doing when it comes to the offense

every team even remotely by the ravens in offense are either rebuilding have terrible offenses and are looking for a qb none of those teams are actively trying to win a sb this year

yet the ravens thought it a good idea to send their mvp out with that type of offensive support if you double what the ravens are doing on offense they are still in the bottom 14 of the nfl

i have no words
one of the things that confuses me about baker thoughin his rookie season where he appeared to be the possible top of his class he was doing it without beckham chubb hunt and landry part of the year he was doing it with guys i didnt know and have since forgotten i couldnt have possibly imagined hed be so mediocre after they added all those pieces and im stoked to have been wrong about thinking he was something to be afraid of in our division even if i dont yet understand how he got worse with more talent
in bakers defense he did have to force feed obj which staggered their offense thats part of the reason hes been better since objs injury still none the less lamars clearly doing much more with much less
i wanted the ravens to trade for dj chark before the deadline but now he will likely stay in jacksonville to pair with trevor lawerence
unpopular opinion but i think we have better rbs than cleveland
say it louder
shes not wrong you know
lol this got removed from rnfl
how great would it be for browns to sign bm to a long term deal then release him after 2022

no one thinks lamar has reached his ceiling as long as he plays his game and doesnt try to be mahomes hes going to destroy afc north for another 10years cleveland and steelers battling for the basemen
we have been better or significantly better at like 80 of positions up until this year lamar is better than baker but the difference is not as wide as this passage makes it out

also our wide receivers havent been great but there is a large difference between boykin snead hollywood and guys off the street who have practiced almost 0 with the qb the things are not
i dont know if i agree with that on one hand the scheme the ravens run is only possible because of lamar on the other hand guys like fluker might not be the best all around player but he is great fit for this scheme i think thats true for a number of guys on the offense they arent a universal fit for every team but they fit what the ravens want to do
their top receiver in that game was an undrafted rookie who was on the practice squad until december 14th hollywood willie snead dez bryant even duvernay and boykin are better than that horrible take bakers situation was 10x worse
this could be a chicken and egg thing though because we arent ever going to have a pro bowl wr running this style of offense we have 2800 yards passing as a team 1100 of those are to tes and rbs not to mention its been scientifically proven that for all the great things our front office and coaching staff do they cant draft and develop a wr to save their lives blocking isnt an appealing job for free agents either
sarah ellisonyou couldnt have said it better
we have hollywood boykin dez and snead this lady is so biased its crazy baker had practice squad wrs thats a whooooollle lot different i like baker hes improved so much this year
im just saying this is a bullish narrative its not the fact baker lost his wrs its the fact baker lost the wrs he practiced with all week less than 24hours before the game if baker had the week to work with the 2 practice squad wr and the newly signed wr from 3 weeks for an entire week its prolly a different outcome hell the new 1 wr had no idea what he was doing would lamar do the same thing if he lost andrews brown and others 24 hours before a game who knows but it proves nothings again bulls hit narrative
this just comes off like an inferiority complex nobody cares work harder
whos gonna be the soulja to post this to rbrowns

we brought in huntley as our qb2 and a practice squad te forgot his name lol
willie snead is emergency qb3
yea
seems like the bills are the little kid that got bullied by his step dad for years and now hes big and strong and the step dad is old and fat and the kid is kicking his ass and repaying him for all the torture he put up with growing up
i would love footage of that to show to my from new england wife
unpopular opinion id still rather see the patriots over the bills they are the same as the browns to me so fuckem and i cant wait until they slip back into being trash
i dont know how long bills act is going to play in new england if they dont get better in the next couple seasons i would put my money on bill turning things around there but his post game press conference was just brutal it was kinda funny when they were dominant but now that they suck his act is pretty offputting another two losing seasons and theyll be completely fed up

i get that it has to be annoying to answer reporter questions win or lose and that most answers are just a word salad of cliches but it is quite literally the reason for all of this if you dont have fans you arent playing games or getting paid millions just man up and answer questions like a normal person his answer to every question came across as you are too stupid for me to give you a real answer you just wouldnt understand so im not going to say anything
who do you think we could pick up or trade for in the off season next year im thinking maybe allen robinson or kenny golladay
need to focus on resigning our own players and the draft not much cap space for free agency splashes without significant roster sacrifice
i really want allen robinson with us
robinson would be great but it would probably mean losing some guys on defense personally im all for it
even if we let our top 3 pass rushers go to make room for a top wr theres no guarantee they sign here its not as simple as saying we want themthey have to agree to sign here lamar iswas mvp and all we could get was dez
what i want to see either resigning ngakoue or signing robinson

what edc is going to do resign bowser and address wr with a cap casualty like brandin cooks or alshon jeffery to preserve ngakoue and judons comp picks
allen robinson has 100 catches this year 1200 yards 6 tds

last year he had super similar numbers almost 100 catches almost 1200 yards 7 tds

that dude is going to be way too expensive for us
lets discuss the scenario of us traveling to buffalo in the playoffs im watching them crush the pats right now as much as i realize the pats are a 68 team buffalo seems like theyre doing really dang good hoping our secondary comes to play
if we can take diggs out of the game we can take them in most other aspects id hope we put humphrey on him
if peters and smith are playing i think we smoke them
we will run it down their throats and beat josh allen up like we did last year we have the talent and personnel to go score for score with them and the chiefs honestly if lamar is playing his game and not trying to be somebody else which was the case earlier this year in week 3 good thing is i think hes learned that lesson
to be the man you gotta beat the man

diggs is scary tho
i dont want to face them

i have a few friends who are bills fans they are good people i would love to see them go deep just not at our expense i think buffalo is well due another shot if not us i would prefer it be them
below average run defense vs dobbins gus and lamar should be easy
if our defense is healthy and we dont try and get cute on offense no team can stop us
i envision a bunch of splash plays after allen escapes pressuresack finishes our secondary even those playing seem hampered i dont think its a good matchup at all

lamar made the same complaint after we faced the colts
spygate 20
diggs and allen are cooking really do not want to see this team in the playoffs if we are to make it scare me more than the chiefs

we dont even need a wr 1 the caliber of diggshopkins we just need a wr with the caliber of someone like boldin the way this offense runs the balleven against good run defenses it levitates some of the need for top tier wr someone like allen robinson would be perfect but im not sure edc will spend money on him yetwe gotta pay bowser and judon or yannick this offseason then next offseason we gotta pay mark andrews or orlando brown
how much of allens breakout season would you credit to diggs
the chiefs have more weapons against buffalo wink can scheme and put humphrey or a bracket over diggs problem contained
bills showing why we shouldve pulled the trigger on drafting another terp wr
i always called diggs a whiney bitch always saying he was a wr1 but being treated like a wr23 in minnesota i always called him a wr2 and thought he was like all of those nba players out there trying to build a super team boy was i ever wrong he wanted to be traded to a team that would treat him like a wr1 and my god is that ever apparent he is a bonafide wr1 and was bang on regarding his accusations i love watching him play and i would imagine decosta has taken notice this years free agency will be electrifying
its unlikely we play them in the first round

bills will probably want that 2 seed and either a bills win or a steelers loss next week clinches it for them this means we would have to fall to the 7 seed to face them which also is unlikely unless we lose and one of the colts or browns lose too

but it could still happen hoping it doesnt
their second td was to a lineman
im not seeing much out of the rest of the team though you cant count on 2 players to win playoff games unless its just derrick henry and the kicker
i feel like we have this exact same post every time diggs has a great game and honestly its warranted
yea i dont want to see them either but scare you more than the chiefs now youre kind of exaggerating lol
i think the bills are my pick to win the super bowl id love to see what llama could do with a receiver like diggs
allen diggs is the new stafford megatron

different receivers obviously but same level of chemistry they both make each other great and the team great
ah the weekly bills won look at their weapons post
i am also scared of the titans or at least was they seem to have fallen apart
honestly the way the ravens are playing i would take them over bills diggs and allen are phenomenal dont get me wrong but you take away the deep threat with pressure and you shut that game down entirely we tried and failed against the chiefs but i dont think allen has the same toolbox mahomes does i think lamar would do better against a bill defense than allen would do against a healthy raven d we might not even have to wait long to find out

ud gus edwards

the amount of noname players taken in the 2nd round and after by every other team is astounding also makes it even more special
1996jonathan ogden at 4 ray lewis at 26
set this franchise to be a winning organization from day 1
little early to know this but it was certainly a great draft 2020 i think will be another good one 2019 was kind of a dud even if hollywood turns it around almost nothing else in that draft is worth a fuck
2nd best after 1996 does 2 hofrs lock 96 in as the best
here me out


keenan allen showed great chemistry with lamar in the pro bowl maybe wants to play for a right now winner instead of rebuild with justin herbert tall fast possession receiver


aj green getting up there in age a lot like former baltimore ravens free agent receivers
wants to win looks like he doesnt want to rebuild with burrow very tall receiver


both these guys might just sign a friendly contract for a couple years if they can win also dez is doing some great advertising right now talking up how great baltimore is along with other players talking about how great it is to be in baltimore players coming back to retire players missing baltimore when they leave etc
i think these guys might be our two best free agent options keenan allen is a really interesting one because they have plenty of young wrs


or my favorite option dez bryant returns to his former glory while in baltimore let me know what you guys think in the comments

i really like the keenan allen one he is the kind of route running technician that we need he can beat man coverage reliably my only concern is injury related he also is a california guy would be hard to pry him back to the east coast
seems like the chargers are a healthy derwin james and one more draft pick away from doing damage in that conference

an aj green is pretty comp to dez bryant

while im not excited about it gallup from dallas seems like a fit

i think oj howard is coming to bmore and well just keep taking wr draft prospects we cant really afford an expensive wr if we want to retain some talent that we already have in house good options though id take allen for sure
cant afford allen green cant stay on the field but dez might be affordable and while dez has a head start on all of them with chemistry and the playbook i dont think well use him as a wr1
i dont think chargers are that far away they have a legit offense and their defense is good injuries hit them hard
allen just signed a contract extension 4yr 80mso not sure how they afford to pay lamar and everyone else that due and pick up allens contract as for aj greenwell he can never keep healthy last full season was in 2017 and if this team is in a sb window i would think they would want someone they can count on
keenan allen just signed a 4 yr 80 million extension in september
keenan allen just resigned with the chargers aint no way hes getting traded too much dead cap

give me corey davis
i just cant see a solid 1 wr coming to a run first team in free agency theyre numbers will go down as will any future contracts we either need to draft receivers or bring in a vet probably in their 30s

this has historically been an issue that even harbaugh has eluded to when he said this past offseason that receivers will want to come here now
herbert is a stud allen isnt going anywhere their defense fell apart late in several games or theyd be in contention
i dont think any wide out will sign a contract friendly deal to play with the ravens unfortunately i think the ravens will consider giving a good receiver a nice final contract but they must be able to block
i really dont want to waste the cap space on a 30 year old reciever past their prime
a bunch of old dudes way past there prime isnt the answer
i think we can use o brown in a trade maybe sign n trade for a wr like robinson in chicago brown has demonstrated hes a stud lt n teams will pay its worth considering
lol go figure keenan showed chemistry damn i still dream of lamars improvisation paired with hopkins catch radius

i hope he has had someone checking in with him on meals and workouts and stuff he had a tendency to get overweight in the off season his last year if i remember right he came into camp at what he called 3040 pounds above his playing weight


that would put him him at 6 feet tall and pushing 400 pounds
he is great at what he is supposed to do which is stuff the run and free up space for linebackers not a 3 down player but very talented at his job
i honestly have no idea he was always propped up as a great run stuffer but our run defense was always horrible any time brandon williams wasnt there next to him

i hope he shows up in good shape and plays well for you guys but to me he was always a bit overrated
as long as hes in shape and healthy he can be an anchor to your dline and make the players around him look better
theres been maybe three ravens defenders that have left the ravens and made an impact i imagine micheal piece will be one of those players who performance was part of the system rather that individual talent so many teams over pay for our players pierce was just another role player that we dont miss but he was a package lineman who was inserted in run plays
i thought he was really good his first couple years just a mammoth body that took up blockers and stuffed the run wouldnt be a stud but was a great piece to build a solid run defense around he was also an undrafted free agent so it worked well for us he seemed to trail off his last year or two here but i still wanted him back i remember when everyone was down on brandon williams and wanted pierce over williams however he seemed to have a bit of a falling out with the coaching staff his last year here and that may have contributed to his lackluster play he knew he wouldnt be back and was just going through the motions

i think hell be a solid role player for you you probably wont hear his name much but hell help make other players on the line standout he does need to stay motivated and in shape for this to happen though he had some problems with that here


browns fans have been worse than ever im all for getting them knocked out
considering the circumstances no
nah i want them to win too so browns can be completely pushed out
now hear me out they can be eliminated with a tie
im more concerned about the browns than the steelers
no i want the browns eliminated for the memes
id love to see the steelers win cuz fuck the browns steelers are already in so a loss for them would do nothing but if the browns lose theyre out which would be funny as hell unfortunately tho that means that the steelers have nothing to play for and are likely gonna be resting key players so its likely theyll lose anyways
no lol we want to the steelers
steelers are in either way so may as well root for them to fuck over the browns
seeing as the only way browns are gone then i think this is perfectly acceptable
better for the ravens the steelers win so yes
yall really talking about blowing it if we lose to the bengals we doesnt deserve to progress to the playoffs
if you want them to win so that it helps us thats acceptable otherwise fts
fuck the steelers i just want the browns to lose not rooting for any team to win just want browns to lose
we want to play the steelers in round one not buffalo so whatever it takes for that to happen
yes it is bad and you should feel bad for saying it

the football gods are like conan the barbarians god just as they smote the steelers for trying to politic a win theyll smote us cheering for math than the blood of our enemies
no people will shame you possibly but theres nothing wrong with wanting the best for your team even if it is also the best for your rival for example theres nothing wrong with the steeler rooting for the browns because they want to make the playoffs above anything else
i cant root for the steelers to win but i will root for the browns to lose
short answer yes

long answer did you really just say you want the fn steelers to win there is never an acceptable time to cheer for the enemy make sure you turn in your purple jersey on the way out traitor

fuck pittsburgh
itd be funny if the browns missed the playoffs and it would keep a historic streak of missing the playoffs alive

however i respect the browns more than the steelers i think theyre a better team i want them in the playoffs seeded lower than us why because if a lower seeded wc team wins their matchup then that team has to play kc in week two instead of us i think the browns could win against any of the division winners except kc

could you imagine posting this to the ravens subreddit instead of just googling nfl playoff seeding
bills are 2 seed with win or steelers loss
as of right now bills are the 2 seed they hold the tiebreak over the steelers

man i am not anti vax and will get the vaccine but we also need to know more about the side effects of it afaik this is new technology
makes me want us to sign russell okung and really see people go apoplectic
personally im extremely disappointed queen was becoming one of my favorite players in the team but i wont be watching stuff like this reposting misinformative antivax bullshit as someone with a large follower base is extremely dangerous

i wont link the video since it doesnt deserve any more attention than it already has but if you wanna see it youll find it in his ig story
you can either get vaccinated not get covid and be able to go meet up with your mates go to the pub go on holiday do what you want to do

or dont get the vaccination we all stay in lockdown and keep dying your call
hes 21 it doesnt make it right but again hes 21 hes a baby

he will likely remove it by noon
i mean i dont really care its a free country he is allowed to think what he wants

just because he is well known doesnt mean he has to have the same beliefs as you
i really dont care about any players political leanings
he may be a great young player on our team but this is just idiotic wtf queen
hide this before anybody sees this please
to be clear it appears as though he is against the covid vaccine and not vaccines in general this is very misleading in that regard and shame on you for being so broad with a players reputation at stake secondly queen is not an outlier many people are suspect of the covid vaccine while still supporting vaccinations in general if anything science has given people enough reason to be cautious over a vaccine becoming available for the first time ever without going through years of testing
let him live in his own world bro it doesnt affect u

at this moment the steelers theyve been completely found out
hell give us the steelers in the wc round and the titans in the 2nd round and then beat kc in the afc championship round revenge tour complete
either titans or steelers i cant choose between them two
i hope you guys take the steelers down
steelers one half and titans the other

if i had to choose the titans because that playoff loss hurts a touch more right now
in the playoffs forgot to put in title
easily the steelers tits offense is lethal to our defense
steelers no question

they barely beat our practice squad and we couldnt even muster up a ful game day roster

i am not positive we can completely contain henry just yet maybe just enough but everyone steps their game up in january
titans steelers in the afc championship game
easiest strength of schedule this year lets keep it going if we play titans i dont think we move on
more than likely the bills or titans its a long shot to play the steelers

nope i love them all

but i am imagining and having faith that if we win on sunday that judon yannick williams humphrey campbell etc etc i could list everyone for days lol

to get us to the super bowl lv

that would be so much better
they should appear to lamar like the force ghosts at the end of return of the jedi after we win the super bowl
ive only been watching the nfl seriously now for about 2 years ive been a causal fan for many years but ive decided to jump on the ravens camp awhile back and looking at what weve done this year and what we are facing next year id thought id share my 2 cents and see what your thoughts are im fully aware my opinions are going have all kinds of holes so lets get to it

steve bisciotti the owner has said his goal in owning the ravens is to have a team that contends for the play off every single year i like that goal so lets look at our division

our division

steelers ben roethlisberger is an all star mvp superbowl ring qb not only that he has good weapons to throw too tomlin is an experienced and succesful coach
browns mayfield is coming into his own they have a ton of talent both in the passing and run game with their new head coach they are going be real contenders
bengals well im of the opinion that their owners are cheap cunts they got joe borrow who showed flashes of brillance before he was injuried not only that they got really rock solid draft position and its highly likely they are going be talent stacking they are going be real contenders although they also may not

i would argue our division is one of the toughest to succeed in and i think next year its going be even harder

2021 game plan

in short we gotta let lamar be lamar hes one of the best rushing qbs in the league the thing is everyone fucking knows that so we gotta also make sure lamar has weapons around him to rely on in the pass game and that is something that i know we suck at now going into 2021 we got 284 mill in estimated cap space

draft

i dont follow college football too closely so im not entirely sure on what talent we got coming into the draft but if i was in charge of drafting this would be the order i would work in

round 1 draft a wr i want someone really fast that can juke and move and get yac
round 2 draft a te i want someone thats a capable blocking and fast to help with our run game i also want someone that can catch when needed
round 3 draft a safety or edge rusher
round 4 i want someone for the offensive line
round 5 i would either a safety or edger rusher which one i get will depend on what i found in round 3
round 6 its going depend on whats left but im potentially looking at someone on offensive line as more depth maybe a hb or maybe even a qb

roster moves

qb

rg3 is not getting resigned im sorry but cap space is a thing and with trace i dont see why we need to resign him
trace is still on our roster till 2022 he showed he can be a capable back up
we can rely on tyler huntley for our 3rd string qb
or if that fails and we dont draft anyone in the draft for qb in the 6th round we can maybe look at taking on haskins who was just released from the washington for cheap i know he has behavioral issues but as a back up qb i think he is serviceable fyi this would be my last resort for my 3rd string qb

hbfb

ingram im looking to trade him we are probably going need the cap space for gus edwards i knmow hes been on our team for a long time but between all our rbs hes one of the least productive and i just dont think paying a 30 year old rb is a good move and to be honest i wouldnt even care what i get for him in the trade
gus edwards his rookie contract is up hes done well for us im looking to resign him to 345 deal with a yearly cap hit of around 57 mill
jk dobbins and justice hill are still on rookie contracts i like em we keep em
we might draft a hb in the draft well see
patrick i really like him hes good to have next year is the last year of his contract well have to see how things go

wr

thisthis needs work

willie snead hes one of our best wr but he hasnt produced a lot of yardageif we keep him for a good price im fine with resigning himif not it was nice having you around but good bye
brown rookie contract he isnt going anywhere
chris moore hes gone
miles boykin i wanna see if i can trade him if i cant fill another hole keep him but he hasnt produced much
devin duverney we still got him on a pretty cheap contract
james proche i might look to trade him or keep him
deandrew white i know he was hurtm but even looking at his career he has a grand total of 93 yardsim not interested in him at all
antoine wesley he was hurt in 2020 still a rokkie rookie contract maybe hell surprise us
dez bryant im resigning to a 1 or 2 year deal even if his stats are the best hes our most senior veteran wr and i think we need that
deanthony thomas 6 years in the league best season was 143 yardsit was nice knowing you but good bye

te

nick boyle im not sure on this one might want to trade himbut we will see i dont know if i could trade him
mark andrews love this man in 2022 i guess hell be naming his price
jacob breeland might be cutting him lets see how he healed up
eric tomlinson hes gone

offensive line

if i dont mention them its because i dont have an opinion

ronnie stanley i hope he comes back healthy i like him and i think our season would ahve been much better with him
matt skura resigning him
dj fluker not suremight resign him if i can get a good price but i also wouldnt be upset if he walks

defensive line

if i dont mention them its because i dont have an opinion

yannick ngakoue resigning him
derek wolfe if i can resign him for a good price im keeping him
justin ellis same
jihad ward same

line backers

if i dont mention them its because i dont have an opinion

matt judon its going be tough to pay him but im going try my best
tus bowser if i can get him for a good price resigning
pernell mcphee if i can resign him for a good price im taking him

secondary

if i dont mention them its because i dont have an opinion

jimmy smith if i can keep him to a 1 or 2 year deal and its decent ill resign
anthony levine i think its time we part ways
jordan richards if i can keep him for under 1 millsure
tramon williams i think its time we part ways
davonte harris if i can keep him for a good price he is in
terrell bond lets see about his injury

special teams

justin and sam are around for a couple more years

morgan cox our ls is a free agentif hes willing to stay on for about the same cash i got no issues with him

free agency

obviously ill be looking to fill any holes in my roster in that but yea
yea this definitely screams casual fan lol well written and all but this is gonna get eviscerated
i think you overvalue our players in the trade market nobody is going to give up anything for guys like proche boykin and ingram

proche has done a fine job returning for one theres no reason to let a 2nd year player walk who is only an 800k cap hit especially when theyre already showing value their rookie year

boykin is also a low cap hit at 106 mill while he might not be the number 2 wr we hoped for hes a more than capable blocker and if you told me a wr would cost 1mill next season and catch have 250 yards and 34 tds and hes a great run blocker on the outside i think any gm would take that value
trade nick boyle wtf are u on my guy
bruh theyre not going to trade half the team
no one is going to want ingram dude more than likely he will retire after this year or take a vet minimum somewhere else but its more than likely he will retire
lmao this whole post is hilarious
damn so you just gonna trade the whole team because they had one bad year
yeesh
bonds aint even on the team anymore bruh
no more wrs

we have enough and given our track record on developing wrs we should look to bringing in outside talent however we have dez snead hollywood boykin duvernay and some more rotational guys mostly for st

we have some serious needs no pass rushers once judon leaves in fa and ngakoue is far from certainly staying on no free safety exposing our cbs

so heres the plan tag judon and package him and trace with our first round pick to the jets for the second overall pick take penei sewell with that pick

we need to keep cox paying him at pro bowl ls price is no big bother


trynna link their ig page
thats pretty damn good but doesnt the raven logo have an eyeball also what is the upvote icon supposed to be
your cousin did a bomb ass job i love the picture
ok but how much do they do these for because this is fire
that sick i cant even draw a stick man cries inside
thats some talent right there
looks great
so word on the street washington is releasing cb collins and drafting a wr 1st so we should trade them cb tavon young and a 2022 2nd hes worth it bruh maybe even a first
word on the street lmao


also youre not getting a player and a 2nd round pick for a guy who has played less than 4 games two years in a row lol
im a washington fan who follows the ravens closely so lemme get a few things straight

1 we dont have a cb named collins if youre thinking about landon hes a ss and if we released him it would be cause kam curl 7th rd rookie has looked like a stud in his absence and costs almost 20myr less our cb group is extremely solid and the last thing we need is an injury prone slot cb although tavon is very good when healthy

2 terry is under 25 yrs old has 2 years left on rookie contract is already a captain and would be the 1 receiver on 75 of teams in the league theres a 0 chance were looking to trade him literally 0 on top of that he loves the team and isnt the type of player to quit on his team i dont know who your sources are but im sorry to tell you that theyre extremely misinformed

3 i highly doubt we draft a wr with our first as there are a ton of great fas available and the reason were targeting wr in general is so we have a guy to take some coverage away from terry if we got rid of him whoever we sign is just gonna get all of the coverage terry gets now but perform worse because teams dont let terry caliber receivers walk

4 hes worth at least a 1st and one thats higher than whatever pick youre going to finish with
its a little early to be that high
man i cannot wait for the off season with this guy posting more it could be one of the funniest profiles here since law so hard you have the same sources as all the thirteen year olds that retweet anything and then when one of the tweets is right theyre all the sudden an insider you stink of covid loneliness and i hope that gets better for you

if you take a quick cruise through this guys profile it could be its own sub of horrible opinions and poorly made up stories if yall want a good laugh check his post in relationship advice i saw it a few weeks back when he posted one of his other madden ideas for the ravens 2021 roster i wont give it away but its a doozie of made up nonsense
this post doesnt make sensewhy would they be willing trade their best player on offense who is still on his rookie deal only to replace him with an unproven rookie wr when they clearly need to draft a qb in the first round
hypothetically if that were true if i were wft i would want more than an injury prone cb and a 2nd for terry forsure he is definitely top 1015 in the league imo
if we win on sunday vs the bengals who will we possibly play in the first round ive heard all type of answers but we are currently a 6th seed which means we would play the 2nd as of right now what we chance come that win sunday
the first round of playoffs will be 2nd seed vs 7th 3rd vs 6th 4th vs 5th that being said it really all depends on how things shake out this coming weekend but it looks pretty likely we play the titans or colts depending on who wins that division
if and thats only if we win we can either be the 5 or 6 seed depending on what the dolphins do
if the colts vs jags titans vs texans and bills vs dolphins all win we get the titans

if the dolphins win we get the steelers with a browns win and the bills with a steelers win

we get the colts if the bills colts and texans win

fuck this scumbag
this is such a bad look and the organization is gonna get rightfully bent over a barrel for it
fuck this guy
fire his ass dude put actual lives in danger because he is an arrogant clown dont trust his judgement at all
imagine causing this much pr damage at a desk job and not getting fired
this dumb fuck
fire saunders
steve saunders must go

like anyone anyone by my reckoning deandre hopkins is the best in the league so ill say him of the receivers either hitting free agency or likely to be a cap casualty allen robinson seems like the best option

trade mark ingram for julio jones and a 2nd rounder



but actually though arob godwin but hes a pipe dream and a half if we get juju i will fucking riot
allen robinson
i think we should go overkill sign golladay godwin or allen robinsonpreferably robinson and draft a receiver in the first two rounds like bateman olave st brown wallace marshall
anyone who can beat man coverage who isnt like 510 like basically all of our wrs

not saying its possible to get him but amari copper would be amazing he and davante are my picks for bets route runnersrelease artists in the league
i have day dreams about us trading for tyler locket
justin jefferson is an amazing route runner one of the best in the league yes already if you watch breakdowns of what he can do already you would be surprised
all big possession receivers they should just line up all tight ends and not worry about the receiver position
i think i would prefer travis kelce over any wr in the league

he can still take the top off of the defence

he is a mismatch for every defender in the league

he can dominate safeties in the run game

i think the key to the ravens success recently has been they have been forced to use personnel and formations better since boyle has been out they have accentuated power running out of spread formations and i think formations with andrews and kelce would fit that mindset perfectly
the outside guy is nice and will help lamar develop as a real passer he has a natural tendency to throw in the middle of the field and this would help make him a more complete passer but i wouldnt count on a huge difference in year one allen will be expensive and correct me if im wrong didnt he say something on twitter about a receiver going to baltimore last fa period being stupid or insisting its a dumb idea bc of our system

id like to get dez an offseason and milk him for another year or two i like the idea of signing the bigger body like corey davis or mike williams on the outside but id lower expectations on them as mentioned

id invest heavy in oline since brown jr may be playing his way out of baltimore soon and well need a starting rt before we know it draft for future not for today when you can

if a stud receiver fell sure grab him but id think we prioritize interior oline and edge with bowser mcphee and judon all fas
we will likely go after someone like will fuller or aj green we arent going to pay a true 1 so our options will be an older former 1 like green or a speedster like fuller having a speed guy opposite hollywood will help keep things underneath open for the tes and run game too
itll probably have to be a trade theyve had 2 years to find lamar a good wr and all thats been rumored is that we attempted to trade for dhop and thielen granted edc has drafted 4 wrs since 2019 but only brown was taken earlier than the 3rd round

why because wrs will be underused in our offensetheir stats will suffer and therefore so will their future contracts plus not all receivers want to block as much as we need

i wish we could just tell allen robinson to sign with us but it doesnt work like that they have to be willing to come here
my hot take is that we dont really need a true no1 wr i think the weakness we have when it comes to playing from behind is better addressed by keeping our running game so effective that teams have to sell out to stop it and keeping the defense good enough to prevent us from falling behind by more than a score or at worst two lamar is a unique qb with a unique skillset and an offense built around him that plays to his strength best isnt going to look like other nfl offenses and thats fine every team has a weakness better to have it be something predictable that you know how to hideprevent other teams from taking advantage of

what we do need in terms of our wr corps is a true chainmover i think the intent was for boykin to be that guy and while boykin seems to be improving hes not there yet we need a wr that like andrews lamar can trust and put the ball up to on thirdandeight and expect them to come down with it past the marker now if that guy happens to be a true no1 wr i think that would certainly be a lovely bonus but we dont need it to be

now with that said if we can get allen robinson without utterly screwing our cap situation i think they should do it hed be a big upgrade and some receiver help would definitely be useful
corey davis

only 26 wont break the bank big body physical possession receiver who can muscle catches underneath and in the red zone learned to physically dominate shorter dbs this year and use his size to win 1v1 match ups

took him a bit longer to develop because he played at a g5 lower level school

hes deandre hopkins light and still developing i think this can be enough because it forces teams into more zone coverage opening up lanes for brown and duv to use their speed and try to create match up problems against safeties

lets face it the nfl will probably never let jackson have a top 7 or 8 guy the combination of jackson and the other weapons can make davis look like an elite wr

honestly i think the league will even be terrified to let jackson have davis
kenny golladay
the ideal fit would be aj brown big physical explosive dude plays like a raven and is the rare wr1 who doesnt need 10 targets a game in order to make a big play but of guys who are gonna be available id love get corey davis or marvin jones color me optimistic but i love what ive seen from dez this year hopefully we keep in the fold for another year
would loooove to see marvin jones here
keenan allen would be perfect great run blocker not a big ego runs all routes and would compliment hollywood
keenan allen was always a good fit for us big body good blocker runs great routes contested catches good hands wish we drafted him in 2013 aj brown is ironically a very good fit for the offence as well if you can take anyone though probably hopkins
golladay and robinson are the obvious names if we get outbid for them i think sammy watkins is also worth a look i think hed be a 1 on any team that didnt have tyreek hill that said i dont think you should let yourself be outbid for whichever of those two you like more even if that means paying a premium with how much nuk diggs and landry have helped murray allen and mayfield i think its clear that a genuine wr1 is a huge boon to any young qb
trade for julio please
if im being realistic golladay or dj chark would both be tremendous for lamars development imo
if dez was in prime hed be a perfect fit thats who i think lamar needs in regards to ability for a 1
wrs are overrated run 10 te sets
ideal wr would be a big body slot guy


i dont understand why people say out marquise in the slot in our offense if you are a slot guy youll need to block and no afraid of contact if we put brown there its tell the d we are passing
id take dk metcalf hes fast big and has a big catch radius lamar isnt the most elite passer so i think dks strengths would help bail out lamar a bit
i dont know who i want but i know who i dont


i dont waant gallup
he gives me juju vibes he is a true 2 wr but is trash at a 1 role


if i had a choice id take dj chark or allen robinson
id say someone speedy like him but also big so maybe julio jones or even chase claypool i know hes a rookie but he looks like hes gonna be a problem for us for the next 78 seasons if he stays with pitt
julio jones it will cost us a first rounder we will have to part ways with judon and possibly campbell but the draft can fill those gaps julio wont be over worked here but he will make x factor plays when we need it and my god will he open up the run game even more than it already is and my god he will open up the rest of the field for you brown and andrews he is the bonafide best option for us and will guarantee us a superbowl free the legend and give him a ring with us the ravens will also make 500 million dollars in jersey sales

okay so obviously we dont want to get ahead of our ourselves we still need to win at cincy but if we get in at 6 we might play pittsburgh at 3 if we win and 7th seed browns lose to 2 seed bills that means we play 1st seed kc if we win 2 and titans win 2 over miami and over bills we might get a revenge game in the afc champ game

someone confirm whether or not my math checks out

edit a lot of folks are saying we might get 5 seed and play 4th seed titan in wc round which does seem like the more likely scenario
yep that checks out can also get tennessee in the divisional round and kc in the championship if the 7 seed beats buffalo
cincy is already a revenge game
i want to see the steelers again in the playoffs

they lucked out in our second match up and have done nothing but bitch all year


im thinking

ravens bengals
colts jaguars
tennessee texans
bills dolphins
browns steelers

which would put us at the 5 seed playing tennessee
i kind of hope the dolphins lose and we win so we can draw the titans first round im presuming they beat the jags
i think the perfect but unlikely m situation is we play tennessee in the first round as the 5 seed win we then play at pittsburgh in the divisional round win in the championship round wed hope for the 7 seed to go on a freak extremely unlikely run and knock off the bills and the chiefs so we play at home against someone like the browns at home in the afccg however its more likely wed run into the chiefs at some point which is a huge problem
you know playing at cincinnati would technically be the start of the revenge tour
our most likely path is

wc pit
div kc
afc buf
i would rather lose to you guys over any other team i would hate losing period but if we lost and its to you guys that would be the easiest to handle losing to a team and fan base we love wouldnt hurt as much happy new year raven nation
2 things

we are 20 in super bowls

lamar is 100 vs the nfc
please beat whoever gets to the sb if it isnt us i cant see another afc team win
if the sb is chiefs vs packers ill root for rodgers he deserves a second ring
being a fan of aaron rogers i hope he is able to carry the team to a super bowl even after that draft
i have tons of respect for aaron rodgers so i hope you guys do well

cheers brother
ive never experienced it but i always imagined losing a super bowl woukd hurt significantly less than losing a playoff game since either way its the last game losing playoff games suck because i reallly dont want to watch any football but by the next week i still do but its painful to watch and i play out scenarios in my head imagining us playing etc sooooo yea just seems like it woukd sting a little less
ayo packers are my nfc team good luck in the playoffs
packers will always be my go to nfc team heres to hoping
packers have been my nfc team for years now i love aaron rodgers want you guys to go far
if it aint us i hope its yall a rod has had such an impressive year plus i really liked zadarius when he was with us
would be a hell of a game
packers come to baltimore next season right sb rematch week 1
packers deserve to be in the sb more than any other nfc team and it is not even close
hey raven fans who do you guys think was better in his career farve or rodgers who would you take
try to get to the sb first
i hope we get to crush the packers in the superbowl

omg hes lucky he didnt get crushed under that pile haha

can you believe its his 9th season in the league already
they tried to ice himpathetic
tucker has made so many huge kicks in his career that i always assumed he was the one that kicked the game winner for texas against nebraska in the 2009 big 12 title game to earn a spot in the bcs championship against bama he didnt take over as their starting kicker until the following year
against tannehill foreshadowing
this was the same day as the harbowl i lol
til he went to texas
the legend begins
hell yeah i remember that a nice sendoff for the ags to remember us by
gave me chills
everyone deserves to have a moment like that in our lives
if this occurs in week 17 for ravens

ravens beat bengals
bills beat dolphins

wildcard round ravens at afc south champion titans or colts

if this occurs in week 17 for ravens

ravens beat bengals
dolphins beat bills
steelers beat browns

wildcard round ravens at bills

if this occurs in week 17 for ravens

ravens beat bengals
dolphins beat bills
browns beat steelers

wildcard round ravens at steelers

big shout out to jamison hensley on twitter for all this

dont wanna see the bills just yet
the last scenario is looking pretty likely
please be the steelers
definitely want that last matchup
last year in our first win or go home game we choked theres no way around that we had everything in our favor to go at least the afc championship and host our first ever and we choked

you dont blow out aside from the 49ers game 6 other playoff teams and then get beaten as badly as we did without choking hard

choking is all psychological when the pressure of the moment overwhelms someone in a crippling manner i think a big part of it is how young our team was not just in the titans game but in the chargers game as well

i think those experiences have made the ravens a psychologically stronger team and i think the browns game is an example of that that was as clutch as it gets against a good football team with our season on the line and i think that this team now is much strong then the team that lost to pitt tenn and ne earlier this year
big if true
this team has definitely faced a lot of adversity which is something i think we lacked in 2019 for sure like you mentioned teams that win the super bowl are often teams who have grown and learned how to navigate through tough patches see the 2000 ravens and 2012 ravens just to name two examples not saying we are for sure going to win the sb or anything but i think this team is mentally tough and has what it takes all and all just gotta truzz
titans were a match up nightmare in 2019 it was irrational to think it was going to be an easy win n the vegas line was ludicrous the defense was vulnerable to the run game particularly against big physical backs like chubb and henry ravens made band aid patches to run d after cleveland in week two it was improved but still vulnerable also the ravens were able to help d by getting out to a lead

the additions to d line this year solidified fully expecting to be ready for titans injuries n covid19 have hurt the d line at in opportune times against titans and the patriots patriots first drive after half time ran the ball up the gut n we couldnt stop it that was the difference in the game brandon williams was injured late in first half n belicheck capitalized

ravens didnt choke it was just the worst possible matchup in the first round
no shit

aight so browns getting in
miles garrett has joined the chat
garrett has to be foaming at the mouth rn
rg3 and the back up squad beat them last year should be entertaining to watch mason get his head taken off by myles garrett

edit forgot about the incident last year between the two of them my comment still stands though
i hope cleveland beats them in the playoffs next week after this
assuming the browns win then

if bills beat dolphins we play the titans
if dolphins beat bills we play the steelers
just for shits i want a reporter to ask garrett post game if rudolph actually called him a racial slur
chefs kiss to the football gods if mason knocks the clowns out
why wouldnt they be starting ben dont they want to fight for the 2nd seed still
at this point rudolph is much less of a liability than big ben the steelers might actually be decent this week

unless pittsburgh has turned things around after the way they played in the second half of this past weeks game or cleveland still doesnt have receivers cleveland probably wouldve won this game with roethlisberger playing anyway
assuming browns beat steelers ravens beat bengals colts beat jags this is what we have



if bills rest starters and lose to dolphins

2 bills v 7 browns

3 steelers v 6 ravens

4 titanscolts vs 5 dolphins



if bills play starters and beat dolphins

2 bills v 7 titanscolts

3 steelers v 6 browns

4 titanscolts vs 5 ravens
good i hate tennessee they disrespected out coach and our field fuck them i want us to beat them by thirty
beating the flaming thumbtacks in their house would have a catapult reaction for the rest of the playoffs

like 2012 checking off names on our shit list would be the best timeline

tenn

pitt

kc
better to face the titans or steelers in revenge games the bills are better than both of those teams anyway
honestly beating tenn would be more satisfying than pitt right now
please be pitt
soooo revenge game either way

me gusta
i cant wait to kick the shit outa pits in the playoffs
id be pretty shocked if the bills rest starters bc if they lose and pittsburgh win then theyd be the 3 seed
i said this in another thread so ill just say it here too im confident about beating either of these teams this time around only 2 teams that i have concerns about is chiefs and bills but especially chiefs
ben is already listed to sit out of the next game

bodes well for browns to win and hopefully dolphins win over bills

nothing more poetic then lamar getting his first playoff win against the steelers
awesome these would be the most satisfying to win i would welcome either of these fucks
i dont know why people think the bills are going to rest their starters they still have to win or have the steelers lose to lock up the 2 seed they both play at 1 so they wont know ahead of time i dont know how you dont guarantee yourself 2 home games if you have the opportunity to even without homecrowds
so we actually want browns to win then so we dont face the bills no matter what
someone correct me if im wrong but buffalo doesnt have the two seed locked up the steelers can move to two with a win and miami win

people are really that sure buffalo wouldnt play for higher seeding
im hoping we play pittsburgh if we make it to the playoffs while we lost both games against them in the regular season they were ultimately very close if lamar jackson doesnt turn the ballover four times in the first game and we have our starters the second game there is a good chance we would have won those games if we match up against them a third time than i feel good about our chances of coming out on top


frankly i hope that we dont have to face tennessee or kc in the playoffs if its at all possible ideally those teams will get eliminated by other squads that we would then have a better chance at beating
wouldnt mind another shot at titsns w calias and brandon playing
colts for easiest opponent steelers for classic division rivalry game and titans for revenge the only boring one is the bills there isnt any story there and the bills are a much tougher opponent then the colts are
i want the steelers since the titans imo are a better team we can def beat the steelers if we stop trying to blitz ben and just cover the receivers their whole offense is ben immediately getting off his short passes to keep moving up field cover his receivers esp in midfield and we can stop them
as long as it isnt the billls im cool with whoever we play
cant walt
bring it
were going to have to beat the titans bills andor chiefs at some point in the postseason if we want to get to the sb lamar is going to have to have a flacco 2012 type of postseason i dont see our defense stopping a lot of these teams lamar has to go in assuming theyll need 30 points in each game if hes trying to work himself into a nice contract its time for him to silence his critics about his playoff performance
id feel more confident facing the steelers again than the titans
i think bills will rest being that it is likely to play them back to back weeks right week 17 then first week of playoffs if they lose
resting your starters in week 17 leads to failure in the playoffs

i was there fans were going wild it was cold as hell though
some of those last few home games last year were miserable at the 49ers game my fiance and i just sat there in silence getting cold and wet lol we had so many layers on we couldnt hear eachother anyway all worth it for the walk off fg by j tuck though
my first game at the bank dads birthday is christmas and for his 60th i surprised him with tickets we were some of the last ones to finally leave it was such an awesome moment for us ill never forget dancingcheering in the rain with him as the final seconds were ticking down
first and only game ive been to i didnt get a video of this celebration but i got a poor quality photo of it op are you in my picture lol

i was there i got drunk as shit and yelled 142 all the way home
i was row 12 behind where this video was taken the atmosphere was amazing for this game
i was at that game we parked in one of the big multistory lots south of the stadium about 6 blocks away en route we came across a commercial tailgate that was clearing out early so the lines were shortnonexistent and there was plenty of everything available including open bar at the gate they said 20 bucks each i countered with how bout 2 for twenty within a half beat they said deal grabbed some barbecue and brats and some beer all tasty stuff then headed into the stadium it was pooring but we had a great time fans were completely into it and for extra sweetness we beat the steeler late in the regular season at home
i was there i miss having fun at the bank my girl got us tickets for christmas and she was very sad lamar didnt play was a great game though
this was the first ravens game i ever went too rain and all i loved it
i had a flight after that game and i got a ride straight to bwi after my clothes were so wet i had to change in the bwi bathroom while drunk and i didnt have enough time to buy a water bottle the inflight cups of water didnt cut it so i spent a 4 hour flight being thirsty as hell

worth it
this was the day i got banned from the steelers subreddit watching their sub have a meltdown because they got knocked out of the playoff hunt by rg3 and only half the ravens starters i couldnt resist
damn i miss this
me too brother god i missed it this year
i was in the nosebleeds for that one it was cold as hell though
took my girlfriend to this game it was her first ravens game ever and she had a blast
was there was fun
this was my christmas present plane and game tickets to baltimore to see them go 142 was awesome the rain only adds to the memory
great game i was right around the corner from you
i was at that game the rain sucked so much all i had was a sweatshirt
hopefully
i was at this game and as soon as you thought the rain was letting up it would just pour
awesome

how much did you pay for the seats really looking forward to a trip to the us from the uk postcovid want to make it to at least one ravens game
my brother and i bought three boarding passes for last season so we always had a third ticket to bring someone with us one of my closest friends from work is a steelers fan so i promised him the ticket before the season even started needless to say the rain and the steelers record at the time prevented him from being too excited but we ended up hanging out at horse shoe for like three hours before the game so we were in good spirits when it actually started ended up being a pretty good afternoon
that was the best game ever i went there with my brother and dad and it was crazy the strip sack at the end was great
i was there with my mother it was my first and only nfl game so far shes a diehard steelers fan so it felt so good to watch them lose
i was at that game also first time going to a ravens game it was so badass
take me back hope next year the flock can return to the bank
i dont want to be a party pooper but im not sure how under control corona will be come the start of the 2021 season it obviously depends on the restrictions but im not sure full attendance is a good idea there is likely to be some attendance and itll probably increase throughout the season just gotta hope
we shouldve thrown that game stupid win
removed
no i hate all of our division rivals that being said i was rooting hard for the bengals to beat the steelers
i think we all rooted for the bengals when they played the steelers

until we remembered their loss was problematic for us lol but it all worked out

however when burrow is back our division may end up being the toughest in the nfl

to answer your question though yes as long as its not the steelers
the only thing i root for the division rivals for is to burn in hell
yes i cheer for our rivals to fail bengals fans are hoping for a top 3 pick so im cheering for them to win games and fail at failing
i despise the steelers but i really like joe burrow and i cant help but root for the cinderella story browns so id like to them succeed but not at the cost of the ravens success
this post is dumb and untimely
i dont root for division rivals because im not a steelers fan
i root for the bengals to beat the browns or the steelers but otherwise fuck them
ill only root for the bengals when burrow is playing and its not against us
no 4th and 12 will make me never root for the bengals unless they are playing the steelers

the only way i root for division rivals if theyre not a threat to us and can beat another division rival ie bengals vs steelers thus giving us ammo to talk shit to the other division rival they beat
you post this when our literal season is on the line against them excuse me
nope

if i root for any other team at the end of this season itll be the dolphins ryan fitzpatrick has turned into my favorite players in the nfl it would be beyond awesome if got the starting job and had a flaccoesque string of great playoff games i know its unlikely but a fellow can dream
lol no
the only team i dont hate is the bengals
fuck all of them but i did feel bad for joe burrow getting david carred behind the shittiest oline in the league
yes i completely agree with you im pretty scared of that sewell guy
honestly yeah i hope for the bengals and browns to do well when theyre not playing us or when we need them to lose

never the steelers though

thank god for steve bisciotti
meanwhile steve just dropped another 5 mill for charity distribution
to keep it ravens related theres a quote in next man up from chris mcalister where he talks about how dan snyder treated him in the predraft interview back in 1999 snyder is a slimeball

so if im reading this correctly a dolphins and browns win get us the steelers round one both steelers and bills are benching starters
whoa this is awesome surprised by how many reasonably likely scenarios have us in even with a loss to to the bengals
so us losing browns and colts both winning is the only way we dont make it
using this table and the win probabilities on 538 i calculated the probability of who the raven will face in the first round anyone is welcome to make sure my math is right

teamprobability play in 1st round

bills1530
steelers1253
titans4665
colts1726
out826

looks like well most likely be facing the titans in the first round im ok with that
pin this pls
god i hope we dont draw the bills
win and in
bills dolphins doesnt matter
titans texans doesnt matter

if ravens loss
steelers or jaguars need to win
i definitely dont want to play the bills i think best case scenario we play the colts but thats unlikely
fantastic content thank you
the most bitter sweet playoff run would be a revenge tour steelers titans and chiefs thats all i want
id love a playoff rematch against the titans but id take the steelers as well
im not gonna be picky about a playoff spot but would love pittsburgh in round 1
i dont think pitt is a gimme but do see them as our best matchup
5 seed 68 titans 28 colts then a shot at the chiefs

6 seed 612 bills 612 steelers then likely a crack at the other one

7 seed 68 bills 28 steelers then also likely a crack at the other

mark me down as rooting for balmiamicleindyhou
of topic but the game results pattern is mesmerizing
thank ya for doing the lords work
this is amazing
worth noting any scenario where we pull 7th seed is guaranteed kc in round 2
i cannot tell you how many times today i have looked at this thank you
a few notes

for clarity each row shows on the right side the ravens seed and first round opponent in the playoffs given that rows week 17 matchup winners on the left side
this was created using espns playoff machine feel free to verify there if anything seems off
the point spreads listed in the header row were vegas odds as of this morning but they can change based on that point in time the most likely scenario if all favorites win gives us the 5th seed playing the titans in the first round
if this post feels strangely familiar you might have been on this sub for a long time i did the same thing 7 years ago when the playoff scenarios were similarly confusing
lets get this pinned for christs sake
i am gobsmacked that you mathematically have a chance to make the playoffs even if you lose to the bungles

what a fucking crazy year
beautiful champ
thank you
if bills are resting then im guessing were going back to shitsburg unless mason rudolph decides he really wants to knock the browns out and some how plays nothing like he did last year and the browns play like shit
get ready for a titans playoff rematch
and the flat odds of making the playoffs is 92 according to 538
as long as we make it ill take any team if you want to claim the title you should have to beat the best i want the steelers but us beating the bills would have a huge psychological impact that would create positive momentum throughout the rest of the playoffs
i need one for the browns so i can know what to root for
we take care of business and thats all that matters lets get it boys
may jesus bless you and all of your loved ones may we strike vengeance upon the titans
so a matchup with the titans is most likely with billssteelers depending on if those two teams rest starters in week 17
excellent table my only tweak or another version would be to arrange the columns from left to right according to the spreads so the games whose outcomes are least in doubt jagscolts ravensbengals have their likely outcomes more bunched together in the final column i think that would give a slightly more intuitive ataglance of whats most likely to happen
genius work thanks
if we beat titans first round we winning the whole ship
dont care who we play get us in
a pretty strong chance the bills beat the dolphins even if they are resting starters imo if that is the case then get ready for a titans playoff rematch
is it wrong to see this and feel like with only 4 possible scenarios in which we dont make the playoffs that were pretty much locked in now

aw
ive seen a bunch of posts discussing little parts of this heres my effort to put it all together in one place ill start with how the ravens can make the playoffs and then who they might face ill ignore possible week 17 ties because ties suck

how to make the playoffs

option 1 win against cincinnati easy enough win and in

option 2 lose against cincinnati but get some help from around the league

there are 4 other teams that are relevant ten mia ind and cle we own the tiebreaker over cle due to headtohead matchups in a 3way tie involving cle they drop out first because indivision ties get resolved first since either ten or ind will be the afc south champions that means the ravens cant be 4th place in competing for 3 wildcard slots if cle loses in other words if cle loses we make it in no matter what

lets assume cle wins and turn to the others in a 2way tiebreaker we own the headtohead against ind ten owns the headtohead against us there is no headtohead with mia so we drop down to conference record where mia would have the advantage in the event both clubs end at 106 mia 75 vs bal 66 what this means if ind loses we make it in no matter what losses from ten and mia dont help us

what about 3way ties because indivision ties get broken first there are only 2 relevant possibilities for a 3way tie at 106 balmiaten and balmiaind neither of these has a headtohead sweep so we drop to the next tiebreaker which is conference record in the balmiaten tie wed come in last because mia and ten would both have better conference records with ind wed come in second because mia would get elevated out of the tie first and then wed have the headtohead over ind what this confirms is that mia and ten losing doesnt help us

the bottom line here is that within option 2 lose and get help we have

option 2a cle loses and we are in

option 2b ind loses and we are in

those are our only three options again excluding ties we win or cle loses or ind loses

seeding and matchup possibilities

theres a lot of uncertainty here and im not going to list every single possible scenario leading to each matchup because that would be too many

if we make the playoffs the ravens can end up anywhere from the 5 to the 7 seed heres how

5th seed

we win and mia loses while ten wins

6th seed

we win and mia wins while ten wins

we lose ind loses and cle loses

7th seed

we lose and exactly one of ind or cle wins if ind wins ten also has to win

who could we face

the 5th seed will play the 4th seed the 4th seed will be the afc south champion theres no wl combination to get any other team there the only way ind can win the division is if it wins while ten loses if ten wins or if both teams lose then ten is the 4th seed

the 6th seed will play the 3rd seed which is either buf or pit its buf if pit wins and buf loses its pit in any other scenario

the 7th seed will play the 2nd seed which is either buf or pit this is the opposite of the 3rd seed scenario described above 7th seed will play buf unless buf loses and pit wins in that case 7th seed will play pit

fun note about buf and pit both of these teams have basically the same incentives this week in terms of resting their starters assuming resting starters is a loss and playing starters is a win each team has the choice between kicking a division rival down and possibly out of the playoffs entirely with a win but not getting a whole lot of upside only real difference between the 2nd and 3rd seed is guaranteeing you dont have to play kc until the afc championship and theres a chance that if you beat that division rival you have to play the same team again next week in round 1 of the playoffs i think that would probably lead a team to rest its starters why bring your best against this team if youre going to have to do the exact same thing a week later but im not an nfl head coach so my opinion on that isnt worth jack well find out on sunday what theyve decided

tldr ravens are in with a win or with a loss by cle or ind or both ravens get a 5th or 6th seed if they win depending on what mia does and a 6th or 7th seed if they lose but still qualify depending on whether ind and cle both lose if we get the 5th seed were probably playing ten maybe ind in the 6th or 7th seed wed play either pit or buf
ben is already listed to sit out of the next game

bodes well for browns to win and hopefully dolphins win over bills

nothing more poetic then lamar getting his first playoff win against the steelers

w and you guys are in great run over the last few weeks i dont think anyone wants to see yall in the playoffs
now that i have your attention fuck the steelers
because the ship has turned around and it is not entirely his fault our receivers are poopoo peepee men
because he thicc af
up voted
as soon as i read now that have your attention thought i just got bucked lol not disappointed either way
hes turned things around with his play calling the run game has been on fire sticking with jk and gus and eliminating ingrams carries has definitely helped stabilize things we also have found stability on the offensive line i think greg roman has saved his job
he needs a new age college coach to come in and revamp the pass game his run scheming is top tier that was never the issue
ravens have the best point differential in the nfl this year
his passing concepts suck
ill drink to that
i will take it under advisement but withhold any more personal judgement until the first time we get in a tight game with lots of time left and we abandon the run when it was working i will admit as a card carrying member of the roman must go club the play callingoffensive game decision making has been greatly improved over the last four weeks
i guess we will see what happens when we get into a close game or down by one score
well the team has been staying out of 3rd and long lately anything over 6 yards as long as they can continue to do that the offense will hum
at first your post had my curiosity but then you said fuck the steelersnow have my attention
we should keep him around but def bring someone in from outside the org to help him with the passing game
after ruining our offense for a lot of the season it seems like he made adjustments and changed a lot of the play calling and our offense has been tremendous again he even found a way for our offense to be somewhat successful with a washed rg3 and a lot of other key missing offensive players against a great steelers defense i dont think its fair to be so quick to criticize him when he makes our offense awful but then be reluctant to praise him when he makes our offense one of the most dangerous in the league again i really hope he sticks to our bread and butter in the playoffs because thats when he has struggled the most to do that
yeah like the guy above said theyre finally letting lamar be lamar more designed runs instead of forcing him to drop back 30 times a game it helps that the offensive line has been playing at an elite level and that dobbinsedwards are finally getting more carries than ingram
yea the execution has also gone up so less people are angry at him too
i think theyve accepted that if you try to control lamar too much bad things will happen you should treat play calling with lamar as a rough outline but ultimately let him do his thing
i think the injury to boyle has been a blessing in disguise romans been forced to spread the defense out horizontally in order to create space in the run game as opposed to just lining up with 8 in the box and relying on brute force blocking or option reads its led to more space in the middle for andrews and snead and so has helped the passing as well also helps that hes stopped trying to make ingram happen

x200b

although for the life of me i still cannot understand why we continue to line hollywood up outside the guys just not an outside wr hes not strong enough not savvy enough to use the sideline or create separation for himself the perfect final touch would be using dez and boykin outside and putting hollywood in the slot and letting the mismatches play out we already saw a bit of it in the browns game so im hoping theyre already toying with the idea
hes letting lamar be lamar instead of forcing plays
they have looked a lot better however im trying not to put too much stock in it since weve also been playing against shit defense
yes i dont think he should be fired i do think it was a bit harsh calling for his job when last year his qb won the mvp nfl is a lot more complex than run the ball omggg if we dont establish a passing game we risk becoming one dimensional

it also takes more time than you think for an oc and a qb to create a gameplan they are both happy with especially when the qb is still developing lamar said in the off season he wants to get better throwing and im sure he told the coaching staff about that so they are giving him more opportunities to throw
hes improved a ton down the stretch but it still bothers me how little we use playaction at the first pittsburgh game lamar was 22nd in the league in playaction attempts and after this past week hes up to24th even if you give him the playaction throws from rg3 and trace in the practice squad game that only moves you up to 23rd and that is absolutely baffling to me when you lead the league in attempts yards yards per carry and 20 runs not only do we run more than anyone else were better at running than anyone else the titans are the only team who should be more playaction heavy than we are and tannehill is 2 in the league

im hoping for a pleasant surprise that greg has a bunch of cool playaction concepts drawn up hes keeping hidden until the playoffs but for now i dont understand why were not using the best running game in football to make our passing game better especially when it was such a huge part of our leagueleading offense last year in 2019 lamar was third in playaction attempts in spite of basically only playing 13 games because of how many times he sat out the entire fourth quarter
iirc i think roman actually gets better towards the end of most seasons i think it may be because hes super conservative not to usegive away playsformations that he wants to use in the playoffs or must win games
i thinks its really been finding success in that veer option look out of the spread formations and working off of that and not being afraid to go to it more then 5 times a game and we have also been using more play action and putting a guy over the lb for easy completions
i still think the passing concepts are lacking but hes gotten the run game back on track knock on wood but the o line has stabilized a bit and that helps
i think lamar came back from his covid shutdown like a new man i still think early in the season he was not physically 100 remember he missed time in camp due to a groin injury and that stuff heals slow im not saying roman did not make adjustments but lamar was definitely moving better after a couple weeks off
i second this idea
id have to agree though i remain somewhat skeptical since weve been here before what with mornhinweg not to compare either of these two guys to abuse but one thing they have in common with relationship abuse is the idea of oh they were nice to me yesterday so everythings fine now again those two guys arent abusers or anything but its the only analogy that comes to mind for me i do have more trust in roman than mornhinweg though so im not completely being cynical and assuming its a fluke lets hope its a positive trend as ive enjoyed the running game the past few times ive seen it its refreshing
people are funny
if the offense is bad it is romans fault

if the offense is good it is because of lamar

because duh it is so obvious
im thankful that he seems to have shifted back to what works but im still annoyed that he moved away from it in the first place
i was just thinking this since he said he was changing the offense against tennessee ive been impressed and happy with the offense
how extraordinary the run game is its hard to say we need to move on ive been really pleased with his playcalling the last few weeks just for the fact dudes have been able to get open just because theyre not running into each others space anymore
theyve let lamar be himself theyve eliminated mark ingrams 2yard carries and instead rotate jk and gus theyve found a good combination on the offensive line plus the running plays have been phenomenal great concepts that have kept defenses offbalance
im waiting to see what happens in the playoffs before i make up my mind on roman

if he calls 61 pass attempts for lamar again hes gotta go
we need to stop looking at little sections of the season and evaluate it as a whole

our offense has looked better the past 4 games no doubting that but our level of competition has also been pretty bad the last 4 games lets not forget that the reason everyone wasnt freaking out midseason was because the last 45 games on our schedule were so cake

im not saying things are fixed or arent im just saying that i dont think the past 4 games are enough information to build a clear picture
i have been impressed with roman and lamar that they found a way to produce a top 5 offense while their front office is dead last in spending money on offensive players
yeah its really shown improvement i do think the offense needs better designed passing plays but we also have what has to be one of the worst wr corps in the league so thats not all on him
against some of the worst dvoa defenses
still below avg passing game designer
not just you dude he had some splaining to do he packed in his galaxy brain from the first half of the season and is playing to the rosters strengths right i feel like lamar has started taking over when there isnt anyone over instead of stalling for receivers to get uncovered

lmao lamar must be so tired of such thinlyveiled commentary
the movies is goated
bruh
lmao just saw this and debated posting it

every time booger talks about lamar you can just tell he fucking hates him lol

booger mcfarland every time lamar jackson scores a rushing touchdown

catholic charities is the name of the organization its not describing the kind of charity lol they provide a large amount of medical care and social intervention in the area
if youre upset about this take a long look in the mirror the man can donate his money wherever he wants regardless of any religious scruples you may have the entire point of christianity is to help those in need
newsflash dickheads catholics are just as human and as worthy of these donations as everyone else
im sure the bisciottis researched where the money would be going whether there is any religious intention is irrelevant my own experience is with a protestant denomination but the principle is the same the advantage of a donation to an established church is that they have the existing infrastructure to administer the funds so more of the money goes where it is needed i appreciate their generosity to the community

what episode

im not sure division games are always so scrappy and you guys are playing your hearts out but the one who kills us just hasnt been the same guy this year aj green i really feel like it should be a win for the ravens but 2020 has taught me better than to trust that feeling
well the bengals ruined our playoff hopes before so its safe to say im nervous
nothing is guaranteed we will have to earn this win
cautiously optimistic its the bengals with a broken aj green and sans burrow but its the afc north ravens should win by 15 but they could very well lose this game if they look past it
glad burrow isnt playing personally hope we pull out a w i was at the game in 2017 and remember being so salty at pees for they weak call and for weddle not playing it right either the offense didnt help much and needed a kick return td to give us the lead
if aj green and tyler boyd are active no deep ball in the 4th is safe
i hate it for the young man but im glad joe burrow isnt the qb were facing i wouldnt feel as confident also please protect that man hes a solid guy
any given sunday
im gonna be at the game cheering my heart out but never 100 confident in a division matchup i just hope we come out to play like our season depends on it
yo thanks for socking the steelers for us
kinda nervous but itll be a good game
pretty good
ive got 20 bucks on the ravens winning pretty confident i know division match ups can be crazy but i think jacksons drive to win will give us the victory youre team is kind of crap this year and youre good qb is hurt

also real pissed off they let burrow get hurt
im hoping for the best i think it could even be a close game very close maybe even 2 5 points any given sunday i just hope we win but i wont be surprised if we dont were likely going to have the toughest division in the nfl this season we already do

have a fun and safe time at the game and happy holidays
ravens by 20
f for burrow obv i want to win and i expect the ravens to but i do feel bad that hes out dude has potential and he was injured so early that sucks
as soon as i realized we gotta play the bengals on week 17 to get in i got ptsd
i still have ptsd from all we need is a week 17 win against the bengals
i think edge definitely goes to us but your guys have been showing some promising signs of life lately so maybe well get surprised

im not sure your defense is up to containing our run game this time so its going to come down to if your offense can keep up our defense has been pretty banged up and having trouble against the run too so maybe itll be another big game for gio
honestly ive never been a fan i tend to waste the day away dreading the subsequent monday im currently in school in order to obtain a job that i can look forward to though kind of you to ask
im nervous asf bc of week 17 2017
has all the makings of a trap game not to say its a trap afcn games are always tough sledding over the past few games the bengals offense has been surprisingly effective the past 3 games bengals have had 100 rushing yards with 150 in the past two games and their game vs the texans shows that this team can score effectively maybe not on paper but the past few weeks our defense has often looked a bit like a liability giving up chunk yards and yards through penalties hoping this game doesnt get out of hand with bad turnovers
this has been the most injuryridden season in a while hope our guys come back healthy
they honestly might sit marcus even if hes feeling 75 have him fresh for the playoffs should we make it
we wont win a super bowl with a banged up peters and jimmy anyone whos hurting should sit not worth limping into the playoffs the team should be able to have almost every player go
i would rest jimmy one more week if peters is 80 i would want to dress him strictly in case of a cb emergency
resting is over rated unless its injury related take care of bengals first and then mitigate injuries
our d line is healthy again and should be able to pick up the slack of letting our backup cbs play and figure out who is our best backup for the playoffs since its such a revolving door lately

i think queen figuring out some coverage would help a ton even marlon was on twitter picking on our lbs coverage and also picking on pq

it means we line up with 3 te on the field for that particular play
yes
its exactly what it sounds like you have 3 tight end personnel on the field
this year we dont run it as much because we dont rly have 3 te but some we do run a lot of formations with the 2 te and ricard
try running it with two tight ends and youll see the problem immediately
hayden wherever you are we miss you
the falconsstole you ok not exactly lol but im sticking with it
what about 4tes now i dont mean true te but a second player like mark andrews but playing mostly wr and can also fill in to block when needed its quite clear we value wrs that can block with our scheme additionally lamar seems to have success throwing to taller receivers i could argue that we dont need any more speed at wr if we keep duvernay and brown snead is a reliable 3rd down option dez and boykin are red zone threats proche if he develops could be useful in the same way duvernay and brown are but i think we need a guy like waller we already had him but imagine that kind of player at wrte i think it fits the scheme well and its very innovative teams overlook the value of tes also so its likely a player like that wont cost too much i could see this offense prospering with one less wr and one more te i like the look of tennessees receivers in our offense granted they are more like receivers than tes but they have the build and abilities similar to tes just a thought though let me know what you guys think in the comments
why not just have lamar and 10 tes
soo basically darren waller
draft another wr if one falls to you do it early dont have them be 165 pounds and have them be someone who had success in college and wasnt a one year wonder who just tested well

if devonta smith is there i hope they dont hesitate to pull the trigger though i would still like them to put some weight on him
so like what snead does snead blocks very well
fuck it 4 tight ends
imagine andrews waller hurst with hollywood and duv
fuck it 4 tes ricard and lamar de facto wildcat all the time
it could be five tes or the most elite ol ever

the ravens cannot continue to do this

that is not acceptable for a team supposedly trying to win a championship

get lamar some damn weapons and help
bro id love a wr1 can we just have one i honestly thought the odds of developing one were so much higher than hitting on a star qb given the position we usually draft in but here we are
por que no los dos
darren waller is a good enough receiving tight end that every team in the league would utilize him but hes a trash blocker his receiving alone makes him a top5 tight end however hes not a scheme fit for us at all dont get me wrong hes so good receiving that wed play him a ton and hed be tremendous for us its just not accurate to say hes a great scheme fit because we generally favor tight ends who have at least some blocking ability
theres got to be a reason why this hasnt been tried but i havent heard it
23 personnel all game long every game
2 rbs in the backfield or rb fb
3 tes up front with the line instead of wrs

between lj and the two rbs youve got three running options and three big tes to block for them

with the 2 rbs and the 3 tes you have 5 passing options

all possible plays from just a handful of formations leaving the opposing defenses never really knowing whats coming

seems like its just absolutely prime territory for what this team is built for

so
what about 4tes

im all for it
what part of this dont you understand if two tight ends is good and three tight ends is better obviously five tight ends would make us the best fucking team that ever existed comprende
definitely dont need another te despite what you see lamar thrives when we spread it out and make easy reads for him when he only has his te to throw too it normally is a bad play you can see when we wanna throw the ball we should spread more cause the defense cant disguise coverages and everything is just easier to read we also run the veer or midline option when we spread it out so if we can get 3 good recovers we would obviously love that

between billick and baldinger im fuckin lovin the breakdowns of our offense
hey all been awhile i havent had time to sit down and rewatch games to get a look for analysis and tbh its hard with the level of competition were seeing however here we go

offense the offense is clicking finally i took the time to go back to some of the games we struggled with and compare play type call and situation to our recent games heres what im seeing roman has switched his approach drastically on middle downs mainly 2nd from the film i watched we passes the ball on second down around 67 percent of the time however in our last 3 games we have only passed it on 44ish percent of 2nd downs simply put we are putting ourselves into 3rd and manageable a lot more often which is important for a run heavy team i also noticed an uptick in first down slants sticks and screens again were trying to make downs easy and manageable which is what our offense needs i couldnt really find a statistical difference in the deep shots category but its clear we are getting more success with them recently the most important change i could see was all lamar hes playing with swagger and just playing his game the second most important thing is the line finally finding its combo personal apology to powers ive been a big critic but man is a force at guard great initial push and he can pull well

defense
our defense is hard to figure statistically even with the browns they played well especially given absences but to the eye test theyve been sloppy and seem to disappear the second half humph is struggling without other talent around him as most players tend to the dline is coming alive late though hopefully we sack production continue on the up they are getting a great push at the line of scrimmage lb play has been whats its been all season up and down hard to judge really it concerns me though that we couldnt get a sack vs a good cleveland line most the teams well see if we make it in the playoffs arent going to have the giants line

anyway i hope everyone had a good holiday lets go ravens and as always fuck the steelers

if the ravens have 7 point leadplease no prevent defense

very tough schedule
dont forget the cardinalsrams due to the 17th game probably will be the cardinals
playing the chiefs and the packers for fucks sake
next years schedule will definitely be harder on paper lets be real it will be a long time before any team will face a division as historically bad as the nfc east in 2020 even the bottom half of the afc west right now looks to be much more competitive moving forward than a bobcoached texans team and an awful jaguars team this year in the afc south

the upside is that it doesnt appear to be as difficult as what the ravens faced in 2019 with 6 playoff teams and the defending nfc super bowl representatives on the nondivisional portion of that schedule getting both the chiefs and packers at home is a huge benefit although how much that means in terms of fans remains to be seen you at least avoid the harsh green bay weather if that game was to be very late in the season however
getting the pats and texans sounds so nice if we still make the playoffs obviously because both are in multi year rebuild mode but honestly finishing behind the browns just isnt worth it
fuck we gotta play the chiefs again i thought that shittsburgh would get those honors this time around
michel pierce reunion
31 vs the nfcn

31 vs the afcw

42 vs the afcn

defeat dolphins nfcw

lose to afcs

total 125
im sad that no one mentioned that we get another gif war with the chiefs sub next season easily my favorite new tradition
damn all those teams have to play lamar jackson next year you gotta feel for them


hes picked us
hey things sure have changed huh cant tell whether youre glad pitt won or you guys still want to beat the shit outta them but im pretty sure for the both of us that not clawing for the final spot and having the browns and colts behind us as well is great so honestly i hope youre in so you can fuck the bills for us go steelers go jags they might actually try now and best of luck to ya

until next time ravens lets see each other in that playoff bracket
just win your game and your in same for us
hope you guys get in the playoffs fins you guys have a good ass coach who built a good culture and the coolest qb 2nd only to lj

oh fitzmaaaagic
hey dont underestimate that fitzmagic after that pass against vegas who even knows what you guys are capable of you may even get your own shot against buffalo dont waste it

i think him and mark are coaching quite a few of these young kids in the offense
i dont think it is any coincidence that since dez got here and got on the 53 boykin and hollywood seem to be doing a better job of working to get open they are watching dez work every day
id like to think a lot of jks success is from mark being in his ear a bit
i seriously cant like this enough everyone knows that boykin is a stud physically and yet he has had his struggles so i think this is the absolute best case scenario for boykin as a player and of course as a member of the ravens i like what hes been showing recently and im excited to see where we go from here call me optimistic if you want
havent been a fan of boykins since day 1 but i really want to be wrong about him i think our current wr group while still very young could be really good in another year or so dez can be a great mentor for them
hope we start using dez more he still seems like he has some in the tank
lol dez was about to quit
when your walkon wr that was known for not understanding the dallas playbook is a better coach than your current wr coach
i know its early but what are everyones thoughts on bringing in a true wr1 in free agency im thinking along the lines of allen robinson chris godwin or kenny golladay
i dont think well have enough money to get a top receiver while retaining our own key defensive guys gus i do think marvin jones could be a realistic get though
not enough money
honestly well probably stick with the guys we have not enough cap for a star wide receiver dez will probably be the biggest name in wr core
1 we cant afford anyone with the cap down

2 our system is not attractive for fa wr and since we are a running team we would be playing more for less
im more concerned about the edgeolb situation ferguson is the only olb under contract next year the other 5 bowser judon ward mcphee yannick are all fa
corey davis will be more affordable than the top tier 3 or 4 guys and has flashed potential this year and is a great run blocker
not a wr1 per say but i think that michael gallup would fit in well and be able to elevate the offense no crazy money and no crazy ego
aj green on a team friendly deal
because of the incoming cap drop we dont have the money for a star wr as of right now in 2021 we have 40 players in the roster and i believe 28 mil in cap space ingram probably getting released so bump it up to 33 mil both judon and ngakoue are free agents and we will definitely want one back with my money on ngakoue so thats estimated 17 mil left for 10 players we currently have 5 picks in the draft so call that 4 mil so 6 players to sign or resign for 13 mil also no way we let cox walk so thats another million

tldr we are short on our 2021 roster by 5 players and will have an estimated 12 million

edit earl thomass dead cap sucks
i think robinson or marvin jones would be good fits we need a possessiontype guy the sort of thing anquan brought us at his best
we will be stingy but i could see us getting a curtis samuel type contributor
not enough money retain gus and try to nab a wr in r1
you just spelled injury three different ways
id love to draft terrace marshall jr he has gone a bit under the radar but did well in the few games he played lsu seems to consistently produce some excellent wrs
might be an unpopular and unrealistic opinion but i would honestly love to have juju smith schuster on the team problem is obviously the potential cost but if he were to take wr2 money or less i think hed be a great player for us hes young and has some maturing to do as well as improving on field decision making but he has shown strong hands and a wide catch radius and would be a solid complement to hollywood

happy to see that greg roman is finally getting the credit he deserves the constant fire greg roman comments on rravens started to get real exhausting

that despite all these posts bringing up week 17 vs the bengals the browns possibly losing to the steelers backups

the steelers lost to our backups in a week 17 win and in game

edit i forgot they needed help so it wasnt a win and in deal but nonetheless they lost to our backups when they needed to win to have a chance

fuck the steelers
the real question is will the browns 2020 walter payton man of the year award nominee myles garrett be suspended again for ripping the helmet off of steelers qb mason rudolph and hitting him with it in the head
it was not win and in the steelers needed help that week and didnt get it so even if they won they still would have missed out
week 17 last year wasnt win and in they needed a lot of outside help on top of a win
im dumb i forgot they needed help too

but my point stands fuck the steelers
i know its fun to say they lost to our backups but they were pretty banged up last year and were playing a shitload of back ups as well its also worth noting we only sat like 5 or 6 players not the whole damn roster
removed
it surprises me how many people that watch the nfl seem to want lamar to fail he cant throw hes a running back he cant win big games these next games lets have his back and let him show them what he can do
people will always want lamar to fail if hes still in the league 6 or 7 years from now itll be that same thing youre seeing now everyone who gets major media time at the qb position has haters people still want brady to fail 20 years later
fuck bro im a packers fan and i truly want lamar to succeed man hes having a down year it happens to the best of them anyone hoping or wishing for this mans failure is an idiot the league only gets better with better competition on each team lamar will become more comfortable in a pocket scheme he wrecked the league with a system built around run first now teams have clued in he will figure it out
hey sorry this got long because this is a topic i could talk about forever on a bunch of fronts the tldr is people hate on lamar because hes changing what a quarterback can be in the nfl and hes doing it for a team that lots of people like to hate or wish would go away

full thing

its because he doesnt look like an nfl quarterback the nfl is used to qbs being throwers first and even dual threat quarterbacks like cunningham and vick have still basically been throwers first runners second lamar is either a runner first or hes like a runner 1a and a thrower 1b he doesnt play the way a qb is supposed to play and that upsets some people

the nfl has been really resistant to the idea of qbs as runners consider that vick and lamar are the only two qbs in 100 years of the nfl with 1000 rushing yards even if you only include the modern nfl ie the super bowl era thats still 60ish years with two qbs that have run for more than 1000 yards in a season which is otherwise a notable but not particularlyunusual feat for a tailback theres multiple 1000yardrushing halfbacks per season it gets even weirder when you consider that for like a 2030 year span the big offensive system at the college level was the wishbone which should have given the nfl a pipeline of prolific rushers at the position

i suspect thats because the nfl has a bit of a complex about having to be separate better and above college football which cost the pottsville maroons a championship in the 20s but thats neither here nor there regardless consider that lamar has a real chance or recording consecutive 1000yard rushing seasons as a qb that just isnt done in the nfl and it weirds people out

plus i think if the ravens can sustainably do this with lamar a lot of coaches media types and front office folks have to square with the fact that this could have been done with other dynamic talents that got shoehorned into other positions terrell pryor anyone or got set up to fail because of rigid ideas about what a qb is rg3 comes to mind lets keep in mind a lot of people with very good reputations in league circles got egg on their face when lamar not only refused to work out as or be drafted as anything but a qb but then had success as a result

finally i think lamar coming in and helping to rejumpstart the ravens after theyd declined a bit sabotaged a narrative a lot of people outside the dmv wanted to see the restoration of the downtrodden browns to prominence facing off against the league darling steelers seriously just listen to the way commentators brownnose the rooneys at every opportunity any time theres a broadcast of a steelers game it keeps the afc north a three way race spoiling two of the leagues darlings
theyre just sad haters bird bro cant pretend like they forgot his mvp season and tbest 2 perfect passer rating games not even a year ago
they dont like they ravens therefore they cant like lamar
lamar has won plenty of big games its just they dont consider them big games after lamar wins so they can continue the narrative

haters gonna hate lamars fantastic
lamar is a young guy but hes a big boy who is handsomely paid if he leads us to a win or 3 from here it will change the narrative

this is a funny rivalry

besides being on the steelers what did rudolph do wrong on his part i do not remember

you shouldve gotten a goat and named it tucker
tucker i hardly know her
i would die for tucker
that is a thing that is cute
hes so tiny
what a cutie
tucker i beseech thee take us to the promise land and lead us to playoffs
hi little buddy
beautiful
fucking adorable
hey wait tucker is my dogs name

cant blame you its a great name
and whats the name of the dog
oh what a beauty
hes currently sitting at 908
i only want him to get 92 yards if he rushes for a 92 yard td
i am not expecting it
92 is quite a lot for lamar when we have gus and jk
personality i will take the w with a safe and healthy qb over a stat
honestly i dont think its likely if the bengals defense is as porous as it should be then i dont see them rushing him all that often especially given the option of either of our backs the best shot at that is if he breaks open one or two long runs on a scramble
i think he can the handcuffs are off lamar for this game its playoffs or bust i see roman going all out he carried 27 times against bengals his rookie year lol

also last game he was hurt and only ran for 3 yards i think thats why the bengals defense shut us down despite us winning 273
id rather he stay safe but it would be cool if he broke 1000 whichever we all know he would have gotten it if that asshole saunders hadnt taken a week away from him
unless lamar gets one huge run i doubt he gets it i hope the ravens play it safe and still win maybe he trys to throw the ball more this week
if he gets 92 this game thats a bad thing imo well want to keep lamar fresh all it takes is his presence to have an affect on the running game anyway i think well see ingram activated this game too give dobbins a break especially if hes a little banged up from this recent stretch
297 rush yards for 7td and all the records fuck the haters i belee
i think its 5050 the bengals are very bad and lamar could easily bust out a 50 yarder again plus 42 more yards on usual plays but like other commenters have said i dont think theyre gonna run lamar a lot here theyll want him fresh
if the runs leading to it are safe with little contact awesome id prefer our star qb to not get dinged or worse going into a potential playoff run
id like to see it but i doubt hell do it mostly because we wont need him to if he breaks off a big run maybe
if he manages to bust off a 60 yard run then possibly if its just his usual average 6 yards per attempt probably not
im expecting around 950 or so i dont think hell get the carries for it unless were randomly in a close game or something
ill give someone 21 odds he doesnt and take either over or under
unlikely unless he gets a massive chunk of yards from that counter bash they love
thats just 2 hollywood break aways and an andrews midfield

i say its possible but you can count on the fact that the bengals know this too and will be on the lookout for the ravens to do this it might make better lanes for jk if we just ignore the stat line
how do you think the bengals defense will do against the trio of runner lamar gus and jk
the steelersgiants and colts defenses couldnt stop the run so i doubt it
considering they gave up 12 carries for 128 to david johnson id guess no they will not shut down the run id be more worried about playing them if they werent missing dj reader and adkins in the middle cinci has to have one of the worst defensive interiors in the league so i suspect theyll get a large dose of the gus bus right up the middle and if they cant stop that good luck handling lamar and dobbins on the edge i hope lamar doesnt have to take any contact this game we cant risk him getting banged up


looking back on the bengals texans game it looked like cinci had a ton of success with their screen game and play action game i dont think brandon allen waited more than 2 seconds to get a pass out the entire first half and thats very smart to do with their oline im sure most ravens fans know our defense tends to thrive against qbs who hold onto the ball too long watson daniel jones etc


so yeah their offense could put some points up on us if were not careful it should he a good warmup for the type of offenses well see in the playoffs pa heavy quick passes screens what we struggle with


anyways ill say ravens 310 lol i think cinci is ready for their vacation and our guys are out for vengeance
no
as long as we get the win thats all that matters dont matter if we torch them in the air or run them outta the building i can see lamar finishing the game with 2 td passes with about 50 70 rush yards which would put him 27 td passes and almost 1k rushing yards and 11 ints on the season if im correct could be wrong
only if they have like 5 jessie bates
no look at our running ypc by game no one has
no
im more worried about their offensetheyve been sneakily effective these past couple weeks and our defense has been hurtgiving up yards in chunks or via penalties

in terms of their defense as long as we keep the ball secure i think we can run and control the flow of the game
no lol
they are going to get absolutely gashed on the ground
i grossly underestimated the number of adults there are so im creating a new poll to appease everyone i physically cannot make more poll options then this

as someone who is 35 its hard to know if i fall in the 2535 or the 3545 range here

i would have sworn the average age was below 25

sometimes it makes me feel better to assume that the people commentingposting are young and dumb

unfortunately it looks like its mostly just dumb
ya we need that pt3 now
as a 25 year old im in shambles i didnt know which to pick
im old lol
i feel like that so many polls would just clog the subreddit with unnecessary garbage
this is mostly to make all of us who love the ravens feel old and now i open a beer and cheers my other suddenly realized old people
hey i am not in the last box this time

51
22
holy shit im a boomer
should have each section end and start on different numbers like 020 2125 2630 3135 etc
this is not the best survey design for multiple reasons for one your age brackets are not even ie you have 2025 a difference of 5 and 2535 a difference if 10 additionally you have overlapping ranges so someone who is 25 might not know whether to select the 2025 or the 2535
im old as fuck yo
so to the old heads above 55

lamar elite
still haters in the replies i think the browns game was a turning point for lamar and our offense roman learned to just let lamar be lamar again
technically 114 then
people these days think you need mahomes 35 tds a year to be considered great and any td amount under 27 you are ass those same people praise qbs like vick mcnairmcnabb who barley threw for more than 25tds a year with 3500 or less yards rodgers only threw 26 tds last year and was called washedpackers went 133
arguing with 2 month old accounts with 6 followers aka trolls on twitter must be very high on the biggest wastes of time list at the dawn of the 20s
i know the milestones shouldnt matter but i would really love a breakout run against the bengals to put him over 1000 rushing

passing over 3k would be better but way less attainable
look around the league and see what teams would benefit from having a qb putting up numbers like this

that answer is most of them their front offices could only dream of drafting a qb like this with a low first round pick play this well at such a young age and have this work ethic and attitude

say what they want about stats playoff wins throwing outside of the numbers etc most of the teams in the nfl would take lamar in a heartbeat
if we can win a playoff game or two no one will care what his stats look like dude just needs to win a playoff game i dont even care how hopefully with all of the adversity weve faced this year we will be mentally prepared for it

whoever we face i want to crush them into the ground though im talking a 4 score victory lol
in 15 games
its funny cause some of the qbs with the most passing yards are on teams that arent good likely because they probably have to be coming from behind a lot with lamar he doesnt have to do that a ton so his numbers dont get inflated like that if he doesnt need to throw the ball and we are having success then why would we force that passing yards are kinda a dumb stat tbh lol
most of the people complaining about his off year are probably people who wasted a 2nd round pick in fantasy on a qb and are shocked that lamar didnt repeat his insane 2019 season
what if i told you this year for lamar is reminiscent of maholmes last year and we know how that ended
and yet we might still not make the playoffs


sorry for my poor writing abilities btw


what a logical take couldnt have said it any better myself kudos to that commenter
a titans fan with the username my yummy ass dishes out the most logical take on a black mobile qb im so conflicted rn
ill never understand why people seem to disregard qb rushing yards and tds its not like those tds count for less points so why do so many people disregard them josh allen has 25 rushing tds in his first 3 seasons lamar has 19 kyler murray has 15 in 2 seasons thats a lot of scoring from these guys with just their legs hell cam newton has more rushing tds than most of the rbs that ever played in the nfl

lamar has 3500 total yards and 30 total tds in 14 games this year who cares if they came through the air or on the ground ill take those numbers any day
exactly which is why lamar having 4 of the top 10 qbr games is absolutely impressive is qbr biased towards running qbs yeah it is and what matters is that they make the play extend the drive and score touchdowns lamar wins games why discredit him for using his legs as weve seen its not like every other qb can lead a lamar jackson drive it would be just as dumb for lamar not to run as it would be for drew brees to start having designed scrambles each qb uses their strengths to lead the offense
last october i was arguing with a steelers fan in real life who said that lamar wasnt really that good because he depended on his ground game how fucking stupid can you be
umyyummyass youre welcome here anytime
the comment that led to this statement has been the stereotype of black qbs for literal generations some things dont change
a fan of renaissance italian painting you dont get a lot of those in football discussions
wow there are 600 languages in this world and my man choose to speak facts
i think a lot of fans are coming to realize that lamar is an elite qb and just because his style is very different from mahomes and rodgers he can still produce the same result on the scoreboard where it counts the most

id say the extremely vocal minority against lamar fall into one of a few categories or a mixture of these

1 trolls

2 people who dont want to admit they were wrong

3 racists

anyone whos watched lamar play more than a game or two this season knows what he is capable of and how he usually plays the only really bad game of his i can point to since 2019 is this year vs the chiefs and even then it felt more like a team failure than only lamars dudes a straightup winner and im proud af to have him qb the ravens
umyyummyass we appreciate you
thanks for the love everyone i love lamar and love seeing him prove all of the haters wrong whatever team lamar is on will always be my second team
i was talking about this with someone recently that with lamar people forget the position isnt called thrower and they disregard all the other facets of being an effective qb its odd though because when someone talks about a middle linebacker or safety as the quarterback of the defence everyone intuitively knows that has nothing to do with throwing the ball everyone knows that refers to lining guys up making the play calls elevating the play of the guys around them commanding the defence and preventing points from being scored yet when talking about an actual quarterback especially lamar all those other important factors are disregarded and the focus goes solely to passing stats its not only unfair to lamar but also pretty much misses the entire goal of an offence and qb execute the play calls control the clock score points and win games regardless if on the ground or through the air
irrefutably based
taking a shot in the dark the titans had steve mcnair oops bitches
been saying this for awhile

its no different than including receiving yards for a running back which everyone does
my yummy ass gets it
im a fan of titians earlier works but his turn late in his career baffles me

ok i know nothing about art but i like pointing out spelling mistakes in the most asshole way possible
exactly do you think other teams are only preparing for lamars run game no they try to prepare for both the run and pass his passing game is just as dangerous and people saying he can only run are being ignorant
yeah its like everyone wants to define a good game on passing yards thats so 2000s the position is changing look at the new rookies even burrow can run
ive ran into this mentality on this very sub people say qbr is flawed so i like passer rating


sure qbr is flawed but the issue when lamar is in the conversation is that passer rating doesnt really reflect how important he is to our offense
as a ravens fan im not saying he is number 1 of course mahomes is better in not saying hes number 2 rodgers or wilson could take that spot now for those saying hes not even top 10 just blows my mind
yeah people are just used to the tom brady aaron rodgers style of play
yeah its crazy people like tua who basically one timer alley oops the snap to his rb or wr and goes like 1620 and 90 passing yards but dont like a qb who actually scores like lamar
i think what makes lamar good is that he makes the run offense so much better and his ability to extend the play imo hes just an average thrower but whatever works for him is great i love watching him play
next comment is outraged anyone is talking about a player besides mahomes
joe banner eagles exgm stated that a balanced performance in run n pass game was the ideal for the west coast offense it puts tremendous pressure on the defense at every level

for a long time blacks had limited access to qb camps they had to play the position with their legs as qb development programs became more accessible producing a lamar jackson and patrick mahomes was inevitable

an offense that has 250 passing n 250 running how do you defend keeping the d playing straight up or 11 on 11 is advantage for offense
rrimjobsteve
thumbtacks talking shit no way
damn what a great take
nailed it only thing ill add is that its important that an offense be able to adapt to the defense the giants are the giants but their run defense is ranked 6th in the league i personally thought jackson did a great job of adapting to this he threw when he needed to throw and ran when he needed to run this season may not have been explosive like last year but i do think were a team better ready for post season than we were jackson has shown great growth this year and im excited for his future
correct my yummy ass is a wise man
uh thank you random titans fan
anybody ever tried peanut butter on a yummy ass
a big reason lamar doesnt have the yards is that hes often better off scramble when most qbs would go for a checkdown or dumpoff why add another failure point to pass to a player who lets be honest probably isnt as good a runner as lamar


lamar could bump his passing numbers up if he checked down more and hed be worse for it
what i always say is that lamar is the quarterback of two offences both the rushing and passing offence

no other qb in the league perhaps even league history can say that

im not saying we wouldnt have have a good rushing offence without lamar our oline is especially good as runblockers and edwards and dobbins are legit talents but lamar takes it from being fringe top 5 to being far and away the best rushing offence in the league
the only thing id add is that if youre going to add rushing yards you should also add fumbles and discuss total yards and total turnovers
i will say one thing about lamar tho i am not a fan of his hair lol

also does anyone who actually knows what theyre talking about want to weigh in im positive most of these people are just parroting one guy who said hollywood is better out of the slot hes too weak to play outside which is a rule that i have never heard even if his production has been better from the slot smart folks is this idea nonsense
i believe the slot position is a critical blocking position in romans offense having hollywood in the slot may be a tell that a pass is coming on obvious passing downs it may make sense to put him in the slot
slot or z

just dont line him up on the los as the x

part of the reason he spends so much time outside probably has something to do with the fact that snead blows everywhere except the slot
its not a bad idea unless the work over the middle on crossers part is presented hollywood actively avoids contact if possible which is fine but thats part of working the middle of the field his hands on short passes have also been inconsistent

the scheme needs to add more rub routes or something that clears out space for him otherwise hes pretty much just a deep threat
dude avoids contact because he is tiny and knows he cant take contact that shit might work in college but have you seen the abuse that our receivers take over the middle its a horrible stupid ridiculously dumb idea

he can still run crossing routes from the outside
this idea stems from the belief that the slot wr is just the fastest wr
hollywood should play wherever helps us get the most out of our offense if thats in the slot on a passing 3rd down sure if its outside and we have a blocking wr or te in the slot for deception sure

this narrative that it even has to be that one thing is ridiculous i mean we put him in the slot who plays outside

this isnt a real conversation imo until we get our hands on another receiver
hollywood in the slot and gus out wide as our deep threat its so obvious
literally all his college highlights are from the slot or deep cuts hed probably do better running a route that isnt up the side line
nah dobbins is our best slot wr that motionend around run he has been doing is money just fake it every pass play im sure itll open some shit up
while the offense is clicking the last few weeks and what a relief that is its critical to note that its doing so against teams that arent very competitive

im open to exploring hollywoods success in multiple positions because if were being honest hes been somewhat disappointing as a raven i would like to have a better sense of how much of that is due to player vs scheme moving him around more may help in that regard
he should be hill to our mahomes imo not a slot receiver
i think we should be throwing him more rub routes screens and other space clearing routes they compliment his deep routes and gives him space to make the first guy miss the chiefs dont throw slants to tyreek in the middle very often
given how he hates any contact and hears the footsteps of defensive players the slot is probably not a good regular option for him
i dont believe hollywood would be good in the slot hes not tough enough i think where he is is perfect for him but he needs to line up opposite a true number 1 he will become much more open and become a great receiver that way the offence as a whole will be much more functional through the air

however none of this will matter if the line cant hold they have been playing fairly well as unit recently but they thrive primarily for the ground game id like to sure ill the line in the draft snd the rest may click it always starts at the front
hollywood would die in the slot and all we have other than him are slot receivers at the moment

fans are dumb as hell
if we were to bring in a robinson or a golladay and roll with robinsongolladay brown boykin duvernay proche next year hollywood could rotate between playing on the outside and in the slot depending on the situation and the route concepts we want to run

another thing to consider about playing hollywood in the slot on neutral downs is that it will limit our options in the running game because he cant really block
i stand by what i said about roman earlier in the year no clue about hollywood
sports fandom means talking out of your ass the number of football fans that understand the game well enough to offer original insights on how an offense is run is tiny and im no exception
the problem with hollywood is that his route runninghands arent good enough to get separation hes also not strong enough to run through the contact that wont change if he lines up in the slot
i swear i saw some video lately where dude stated that we were not using hollywood the right way and that he needs to be in the slot since i saw that video there has been so many just echoing it
roman can go if he doesnt win us a playoff game this year
hollywood should play out of the slot
usually slot wrs get more free releases which would help a smaller or less physical receiver like hollywood outside corners have the sideline to help them if they come up in press unlike slot corners

there are other ways to get around it though like stacking receivers and changing if hes on the los
calling for roman to be fired wasnt some sort of hot take its pathetic that it took this long for him to get back to the 2019 style of offense imo this season was a fire able offense for him

i think we will win sunday but its not unrealistic to think that we could have missed the playoffs this season roman not playing to our strengths was a major part of that
the slot would offer him more space to work with on average so no issues from me there
idk of putting him in the slot is thee best answer but he needs to be a more legitimate part of our offense
honestly id rather just trade him i even think his friendship with lamar hurts the team as lamar has given him some wild deep looks to get him some that have gone for interceptions i think hes too small for a really physical league and id rather see if we can get some value from him now and improve elsewhere

and i say carrollllllll pete carrroollllll
so i start marching my way down to mike tomlin in pittsburgh and i say tommmlin tommlin why dont you play your starters so you can bounce the browns out of the playoffs but when i open the door what do i find theres not a single starting caliber player in pittsburgh
the dolphins odds of a playoff berth seem really high are the bills resting starters or something

i like the odds of baltimore cleveland and indianapolis all winning their games while miami winning in buffalo seems less likely to me

i see vegas has a pickem spread for that game right now so i guess theyre predicting the bills rest some starters
i find this guys act as a cringe worthy attempt to parody the election
lets hope for decent early january weather this sunday in cincinnati i am pretty sure that few people here want to see the ravens play in the rain again this season at least they have artificial turf there so a mud bowl cant happen and it looks like it will be to warm for snow

current weather forecast for sunday in cincinnati

showers in the morning then cloudy in the afternoon high 43f winds w at 5 to 10 mph chance of rain 30


if we get into the playoffs i would love to have a snow game esp against pitt

ill do nothing of the sort
fuck yall
thread
as many of us know the ravens need to bring in more talent on the wr front there are some big name fas on the horizon like allen robinson chris godwin kenny golladay but for all his distractions i think juju smith schuster would be a great addition to this offense

why he is a tough physical receiver that is one of the biggest things ive seen other fans want a tough physical guy who is sure handed juju fits that mold this is also the same guy who laid out vontaze burfict for a cheap shot on ab

he is a team player juju is a much better player in my opinion than his stats this year would show but hes never complained when diontae johnson or james washington or chase claypool get more targets or receptions than him hes usually ecstatic for them and from what ive seen he looks like a willing run blocker when he needs to be

i think if we can bring a guy like juju in he fits in with the fun loving but play hard raven mentality he would force marquise into the slot where he would probably be more effective as a receiving threat

plus the added bonus of revenge games twice a year could bring out the best in him
why he is a tough physical receiver

yea but hes still not good and wont do anything to open up the offense because hes no threat to anyone hes the guy that benefits from a 1 receiver look what happened when ab left hes been mediocre at best on a pass heavy offense in our offense hell be just another guy with 300 yards receiving

we need a true 1 wr that can draw attention otherwise just keep drafting guys to keep the rotating blender of averageworse wrs going

regardless were a run first team so unless we trade for a top wr or pay an ungodly amount were going to be stuck drafting guys

i am not against bringing in an expensive wr i just dont see it happening
1 the franchise is doing a massive disservice to lamar if they dont get him a true 1 wr soon our bottom tier wr group is forcing lamar to run too often and the wear and tear is going to accumulate over the next few years please for the love of all things holy help a lamars growth as a passer and b preserve lamars health by getting him some serious wrs

2 juju is the type of wr that needs help from a 1 to shine sounds like what we already have in hollywood i hope the front office aims higher
i would love to have allen robinson but i just dont see it happening i say we sign dez to another year let him have a full offseason and give duvernay some time to develop i would like us to focus on our offensive line more this offseason
like we need him getting other ravens players to dance for tik tok
no way did i shit all over his tiktok nonsense just to have him do it on my team
im getting sick of these posts and im not trying to be a debbie downer but please go to underthecapcom after a quick look at our situation you will realize we dont have the money to get a wr of that caliberthat wasnt a fat check we need to focus on our pass rushers and derek wolfe before we go out and get anyone i wish it wasnt the case but it is
as long as ive been following this team i cant remember a single prominent steelers player coming to play for us while in their prime mike wallace and kordell stewart suited up but only after stops in other cities after leaving pittsburgh and only when their careers were practically over

that said i think its more practical to focus on building the defense and offensive line receiver should be on the nice to have list not the need to have list
juju is a slot receiver

we dont need another slot receiver
nah he is a number 2 at best ab made him tik tok boy trash
with what money we cant afford a elite tier wide receiver with only 25 million in projected cap space
i say run it back with what we got and give dez more time to get back into shape and potentially another year to prove himself as a raven he was so damn talented in his prime and anything close to that will be the best chance the ravens got next year given the always tight cap

people are quick to forget about hollywood too no hes not producing like we drafted him to but this is still only his 1st healthy season a year in which the ravens cant really pass to anyone he needs to cut the drops and mistakes but he is still young with plenty of time to do so and seems like willie snead could be a potential cut this offseason to save but he always seems to makes plays when we need him most and a locker room guy so between him hollywood and dezwith a better approach to the passing game play call wise im not too worried about our wrs

joe flacco was able to get it done with anquan boldin torrey smith and jacoby jones lamar can get it done with a combo of hollywood bryant snead and maybe one more wr to go along with duvernay too who we cant forget either i dont think we need someone crazy expensive or lucrative hell the difference might even be a zach ertz type signing given how much success lamars had throwing to tes and the success of this offense with multiple te sets
everyone else you mentioned is way better though godwin especially me personally i would be fine with marvin jones or aj green for now theyre not gonna set the world on fire but they have reliable hands something this offense lacks even in andrews sometimes
juju is a slot we dont need slots we need big physical outside presences
hes not a the guy
hell no
how about nnnaaooooooooo
we run the ball more than any other team in the league why do you guys always want a skill position upgrade the line and work with what we got

we have the most electrifying qb a top 5 te and just spent a 2nd round draft pick on a very exciting running back we dont need to spend money on a wr thats going to collect 8090 targets at best

i know its 2 days away but i just wanted to say happy new year to our brothers 1000 miles southeast of us i hope its ok if we refer to you guys as our brothers cause we love yall like you are i hope 2021 is awesome for both of us and if it doesnt bring us a sb then i hope it brings you guys one heres a virtual hug to you guys go on a tear in the playoffs i can see you guys picking up momentum you can do this i think we have a chance too but the saints and bucs worry me
happy new year rodgers is my mvp selection this year and hopefully we see each other in the super bowl
happy new year to our favorite cheesehead 6411 kms in the west from my location
this guy is like the nicest most genuine person on reddit we can learn a lot from him unless its a gb baltimore sb then unfortunately he gets the blood eagle
rogers is beasting this year happy new year and a hopeful packers ravens super bowl
happy news years to you as well

happy new year jordy
hey youre such a blessing brother i love the love

hey its a germaine pratt highlight
he is houdini
i was lucky enough to be live for that one
the one ravens regular season game ive been too and my boy lamar gave me that to remember
i dont know what the future holds for the lamar jackson era of the ravens i hope itll result in multiple super bowls but even if it doesnt

thank you to lamar to making me excited to be a football fan again first time ive ever had a legit mvp on any of my favorite sports teams and last season was so much fun while they were on their run ill never forget it
this is what i want to see tomorrow
this is maybe the best spin move of all tie
my favorite juke is when the defender falls down and knocks down other defenders trying to make the play
this ought to be on the top ten ravens plays of all time if such a thing exists
he broke his ankles
was there and surrounded by bengals fans lol all of them gave up at that point
im certain the bengals didnt forget either gonna be a tough test for them against our offense though
ive watched it maybe 100 times and i still find myself thinking i really really really hope vigils mother wasnt watching
even after all these times watching this play the magic has not worn off this is probably the sickest ankle shattering i have ever seen its such an amazing run almost like it was choreographed
ankle doctors watching this clip
now hes got an entourage
you know a play is absolutely filthy when instead of hearing cheers if its the home team or quieting if its the away team people just went ohhhh its like shock and disbelief
he is houdini ian eagle
he broke his ankles
kevin harlan man
harlan has to be one of the best announcers in football his play by play is probably the most engaging out of all of the play by play guys itd be amazing to hear him call a game with romo one day
gives me braxton miller vibes

thats a clean edit
whens it drop
jokes aside soul was fuckin great tho
lmao chillllllll

i love you

lj fort
fruit punch

this dude has been a missed tackle machine

yannik bowser and a high draft pick with judon being a 3rd round comp pick the year after
this is why yannick is such a unique element to the defense he certainly creates his own pressure but also creates opportunities for other players

and its not just in the protection that gets shifted his way hes best rushing on wide alignments which clears out space for stunts and blitzes at least thats how i understand it
hes gonna look terrific in gotham green
wish the dude wouldnt air out stuff about private business conversations he did it last year too
also in the comments he states they didnt have discussions because they werent sure about this season and the nflpa didnt sign off on they year until after the extension deadline maybe judon isnt that expensive
no matter how much his price it was really smart to franchise him it seems like hes been due for a breakout year every year since his second season and each season hes good but not great
honestly i can understand his frustration especially since the narrative has been that he wants too much tagging him was obviously the smart call and hes 100 gone next year imo weve let far more talented defenders walk before
can we pay him in taco bell in hopes hell stay that way
agreed that this is a tactic that players use to get fans in a lather disagree that it would work with our fanbase given his basically average performance this season and the criticism he gets constantly for not being a difference maker
let him walk i cant take any more bone headed plays from him
not buying it i remember seeing that judon had a pretty low win rate considering the amount that he got double teamed compared to the rest of the league

edit league not team
i wouldnt mind him walking he shows up and eats against these bad teams but when we really need him dudes no where to be found always makes dumb boneheaded plays to i wouldnt mind him staying but if he wants a bag he gonna go elsewhere baltimore aint paying him top dollar for inconsistent play
if edc can somehow keep judon yannick gahhhh damn
i honestly cant stand him and his boneheaded penalties off the field he seems to be a fun person but his on field production isnt something im going to miss let him go to the jets
idk how he made the pro bowl with six sacks i like judon but we need more from him he had almost half his sacks this year against dwayne haskins it would be nice to see judon actually get double digits sacks in a season hes consistent for about 7 or 8
judon is an average lb
i dont get ithow has the plot thickened nothing has changed only reason judon is playing better is because ngakoue and the other dline are stepping upwe all know judon and im sure the team does too let him walk and command a big contract he is not worth and resign yannick
didnt see this coming so is he pissed at the ravens for not making an offer or the media narrative of negotiations being too far apart

in hindsight the offseason was unstable remember brockers and that story


hope you have a better 2021 starting sunday
dude that stover and tucker pic is straight

where did you find that
i feel ya dude i just had to put my dog down about 12 hours agoshe was sick since summer trying to get over the abyss that was 2020a dub tomorrow would be a nice start
hope 2021 is a turning point and you have a great year i also have to ask where did you get that oriole bird and poe portrait i love it
bro that limited edition mvp jacket is absolute my goodness
been to st micheals huh

we control our destiny just win lay it all on the line and dont hold back play to our strengths in the run game dont do what the browns did against the jets and make lamar throw 50 times
is it just me with severe ptsd

just me

were playing better but weve also basically been playing a whos who of the worst defenses in the league with the exception of nyg but because their offense is so bad we match up extremely well against them they arent capable of getting a lead and forcing us to go away from the run and teams that can do that have been out achilles heel

i love were playing with confidence again but at the same time id be be careful drawing any conclusions against defenses like jax cleveland and dallas
if soulja can keep catching the ball then the offense can get into a rhythm finally the biggest thing every opponent says time and time again is to win against lamar you keep him in the pocket if someone other than andrews can catch a ball and make plays then it opens up the field for the run and lamar to do his thing
guess greg adjusted
things are never so simple its a culmination of things we found a good o line unit soulja is settled in dez opens things up dobbins has acclimated himself etc
our schedule got easier
think wed know if roman wasnt calling plays anymore
combination of the schedule getting easier getting players back keeping the oline mostly consistent for a few weeks better execution and better play calling remember roman losing his shit on the td that wasnt due to a penalty hes still calling plays losing boyle has forced the offense to adapt into more spread formations offer 2te and dobbins emerging quickly have been two other major factors in evolving the offensive scheme
they have been wayyyyy better than they were in the beginning
it feels like they are creating more and more space with the playcalling so teams cant stack the box even if they wanted the next step is finding out how to get duvernay more touches and getting hollywood more yac as hes been more willing recently to try and get extra yards
his game plan got better with an earlier emphasis on the run thats it and he should have been doing it since week 1


gus bus should be bruce banner

the old emotional hedge
not a bad bet really if you win you just turned 5 into a nice little pay of if you lose ravens are in the playoffs
the dolphins and titans game have no consequence of the ravens making the playoffs

chicks like this always have fire box
bald girls are so fucking hot


the fact that he averaged those stats through 16 games last year is more amazing
everyone is saying look at the record of those teams but he wasnt exactly lighting up the bad teams earlier outside of cle week 1

he clearly had some injury limiting him and roman was still trying to do the old shit with worse personnel now hes healthy and roman has adjusted
last 4 wins the opponents record is a combined 1836 though take it with a grain of salt
truzz

that doesnt seem too hard
looks at bengals rush defense ranking

i have faith
i hope lamar can get 1k again
we should get it in the 1st half
if we rush for 133 plus im pretty confident thats a win
i have lamar jackson and jk dobbins in a couple dfs lineups this week
maybe we can lets hope though
hey guys just in case you were wondering we did this
lmao remember those fucking dummies a decade ago that didnt think the pistol offense would work in nfl

chris ault sends his regards
more like 233 for 2900 consecutive yards
404 bengals defense not found
i think that will happen
i dont think lamar will get his 93 though
not bad for a running team
well have that by the end of the first quarter
the single game record 423 yards is in play now although we got stopped on fourth down we are only 32 yards away
i dont have a concern we are getting it
so we got like 400 yds no big deal
dobbins smashed that by himself today
i bet hes willing to come out of retirement just for a ring if gronk and rice can do it megatron can point blank period this man was physically gifted
youd lose the bet he has been very adamant that hes not returning to football injury concerns specifically concussions being the reason lions being a shitty franchise didnt help but there were other reasons he has multiple ventures hes working with and seems happy
why
no just no

the lions ruined that mans love for the game hes not interested in coming back last i had read he dosent even watch the nfl anymore
lets get hyped week 17 and we win we in

this is my fav lamar highlight video getting pumped for the game in a few hours lets get this fellas

lets gooo
why does lamar get me so fucking hyped like ray lewis coming out the tunnel eating grass hyped whenever i see him on tv embarrassing the competition and dancing you know its over chiefstitans gonna need to experience that when he just takes your soul on prime time and laughs about it lmao
lets assume all current expected fas dont resign and lets keep this realistic
one thing i would certainly not call big dick decosta is ed
the first thing i do is wait patiently a lot of the best teams like the chiefs steelers and saints are way over the cap the ravens are under the cap and are in good position to pick up guys for cheap there are going to be a lot of midtier free agents that have to take significantly less money due to the salary cap crunch there are going to be a lot of decent vets who get cut let all the bad teams blow their money in the first two days of free agency then decosta goes in getting decent players at dollar store prices

assuming that we resign all free agents is beyond unreasonable judon bowser yannick mcphee wolfe ward etc no way we resign all of them

and before anyone says that we have plenty of cap space just remember that we need to sign our draft class and ultimately extend lamar

lastly i look to trade orlando for a 1st and a 4th no way we can pay 2 tackles showing that he can play left tackle well should bring a lot of value especially since he is still cheap next year

guys up front on d will have to get addressed ngakoue wolfe ward and ellis are all ufas judon bowser mcphee and board rfa are also free agents we obviously dont let all of them go lol

hoping we do something about the passing game id be happy with another pass catching te but wr is obviously important snead and dez are ufas and i wouldnt be surprised if we let them both go

oline has to get solidified a strong center would do wonders im not confident in skura and coloncastillo is only 23 but if we let them both go then we have no c on our roster gotta figure that out for lamars sake lol

we need db depth i dont trust that tavon young or jimmy smith will be healthy all season and we cant be playing next years schedule with limited dbs every game is going to be very important tougher schedule next year imo fortunately most of our dbs are under contract through next year

i think that wr and olbde should be priority in the draft obviously depending on who is available if a jk dobbins type player is available at our pick a position that we dont necessarily think we need at the time we obviously take a game changing player regardless of position
when we win the superbowl i will most definitely not have ed
well i expect we keep some free agents which obviously affects how we draft

but if were saying none resign then i still dont think we sign a top wr we would likely spend on replacements for edge rushers maybe we would also spend on a midtier wr or te

the lower league cap is really unfortunate because it essentially wastes an offseason of lamars rookie contract
we still need to see how this team performs in the playoffs but there are a few things we can improve on offense

first add a receiver like golladay or robinson with the offense spreading out we need a dependable outside receiver that can win 5050 jump balls

we should still be a running team with dobbins and gus but we need a boldintype vet receiver on this team to compliment them and brown

for the draft i hope they focus on adding talent to the oline its gonna be tough to keep brown and stanley so we should keep adding blue chip talent to eventually replace whoever leaves

imo the biggest lesson learned this year is the importance of the offensive line to this scheme the loss of yandas impact was hugely underestimated it took half the season to figure out how to make this line work
trenches
we resign yanny wolfe bowser easy

release ingram

trade tavon young and a 22 2nd for julio jones injury has massively tanked his asking price

yup after every shitty loss i kept telling myself if were beating teams in january im not gonna look back at the pats game and give a flying fuck regular seasons just rarely tell the whole story the team that got embarrassed by the chiefs may not be the same team today and vice versa we as fans get too caught up in the moment and try to declare sweeping generalities i get it i do it too but the last few seasons ive tried to adopt this mindset to help me cope with tough losses and honestly its the most logical mindset and now here we are after all the ups and downs were rolling and i like our shot as much as anyones happy birthday btw
happy birthday

big truss

why tf would ozzie leave as our gm to retire and be vp of whatever he wants to go be gm at texans lol
sources say john mcclain not the guy from die hard that is john mcclane
so fucking sick of la canfora just making shit up to get clicks fuck that guy ozzie a raven for life
we all need to give a big thanks to ozzie for all he has done for the ravens i pray he stays with us until he retires and then goes back to the hof as a gm in ozzie and edc we truzz
everyone


mcclain ozzie newsome is not a candidate for the texans gm job
ravens executive vp ozzie newsome not a texans gm candidate sources say

github whatsnew
ozzie knows better
more fake news from jason la canfora
whoever takes that job aint got a whole lot to work with so its a get your foot in the door kind of gig
ozzie is getting too old for that shit


view poll
rgiii hes nice but idk why the fo thinks he can run the lamar offense scares the shit outta me seeing him run lol
who tf is overrating hollywood seems to be pretty hated as of late
does anyone really think mcsorley is good im pretty sure hes just a tik tok meme
currently chris moore

all time michael campanaro
matt judon
marcus peters not nearly on the same level as last year and gets picked on frequently
i think everyone there other than that other fella i think are appropriately rated
i voted for mcsorely but i think judon is overrated no way hes getting top dollar next season from us or anyone
who tf is overrating peters



view poll
huntley makes the most sense given his style i just havent seen enough of him to go ahead of trace i think mcsorely has looked good when hes been in rg3 shouldnt be on the roster though hes had so many chances to play and not once did he look good not to mention hes made of glass and isnt even reliable as a 2
woah woah woah


how is the best passer in nfl history third in this pole
trace the ace man performed pretty well in some tough tough situations we dont win that game against the browns without that clutch 3rd down throw to snead
yall saw huntley take 4 snaps
sam koch for the memes alone
poor rg3 im not sure where he can even go as a back up
huntley in his few minutes looked better than any time mcsorley or rg3 took the field hes the closest of the three in speed to lamar for sure

truzz
where was that lamar votive candle from last year
hes like the patron saint of our family
amen
for so even if lamar giveth away at the beginning surely he taketh away from thine enemy in the end amen
playoffs again fuck the titans
in llama we truzz
rbeleers
monastery icons art style hmm

up 35 going to the playoffs and im mad our second string qb isnt helping us get to the rushing record

were spoiled
wait a minute illegal shift is our penalty
lowkey feel like this is a good thing for the ravens getting no bye week to help carry the momentum
uh oh is this the cincinnati spoiler weve been warned about
peoples opinions in this subreddit of brown
according to nflpenaltiescom we were just awarded our 7th illegal formation penalty no one else in the league has more than 3 this season and since 2009 we are tied with the 2019 texans and the 2018 bills if we get one more well have the most
anthony averett is proof that bullying works
17 plays 93 yards 839 off the clock thats some 2019 ravens shit right there
dobbins creating a new legacy for 27 you love to see it
so im getting a dobbins jersey
last time cincy won a playoffs game the ussr still existed
peters straight out there with a fuck pi all my homies hate pi kind of pick
i got nervous and put dobbins on the bench for my fantasy championship game please shame me for my lack of truzz
was hill even down lol he rolled on a guy and flipped
chuck clark giving us one more chance to get the record zero huntley keepers
doesnt have to do much with his arm

has two beautiful pass td

pick one dipshit announcer
tony gonzalez is such a lamar hater
refs apparently waiting for the defenders to push duvernay all the way back into the endzone before whistling the return dead
lol i love the celebrations from the bengals brownie points for everyone
man what a steal dobbibs was that man is one hell of a running back
how to get turnovers piss off marcus peters
ravens need 73 more rushing yards for the single game record
jk dobbins has 160 rushing yards wtf
i really wish the announcers would talk about the rushing record were literally 30 yards away and they arent saying anything about it


that shit is 70 years old cmon
blame of the game huntley
its cosmic justice that aj greens final game as a bengal is a blowout from the ravens
now these asshats wanna have a defense just as were this close to the record fuck
if you dont like illegal formation penalties you dont like ravens football
to be fair the bengals coaches had about 45 minutes to draw something up
three timeouts and thirty seconds why not at least try to get into field goal range
this is great boys enjoy this because if youre anything like me playoffs games are unenjoyable due to severe anxiety lmao
thats what you fucking get for calling pi on the juiceman
someone should be getting peters mad all the time
this is likely mark ingrams last regular season game in baltimore so

get this man a td
townsend still hasnt punted today lmao and probably wont
huntley has poor vision as a runner highlights how good lj is
excellent coverage on the kick possibly because john harbaugh used to be a special teams coach if ya didnt know
maybe we just gotta get brown three warmup drops before we hit him with the long ball
hayden hurst got a td vs tb good for him
that man marcus was pissed off
apparently jk stiff armed germaine pratt on that td lol
edwards all that girth all that size

announcers all about that thicc bus lol
mark ingram for 1 deja vu
death taxes and illegal formations
souljas get tds
lamar is so good holy smokes is he the man or what
can we give credit to lamar for working on his passing hes still not elite but i love guys who give a shit and put in work my qb
defense given 8 minutes to rest
also defense i sleep
i wouldnt be mad if we drafted an edge rusher 1st round we desperately need it
wink going to sneak into the bengals locker room and strangle taylor after that lol
2 steelers arguing and swiping with each other lmao
i actually want the ravens to be a part of the playoff game that is simulcast on nickelodeon the game would still be on cbs without the gimmicks and slime why because a win along with lamar being his spectacular self will usher in a new generation of ravens fans
love the ol telling dobbins to go keep the ball since he just broke the record
jets are the hottest team in football
steelers looking at us in awe of our ability to beat the bengals
peters that was so amazing called for the pi then made up with the pick
pretty sure we didnt have campbell or b will during the tits game either

i am confident we can pull that shit off man
ravens playing the bengals in week 17 and im not stressed out going into the fourth quarter

today is a good day
bro youre down by 35 and youre challenging that you really want wink to murder you dont you you masochist
now we need a playoff win fuck the titans
dude if we abandon the run in the playoffs so help me
rip mark ingrams career with the ravens its clear that jk and gus are now the 12 punch we use im hoping that he sees playing time somewhere good hes been a hell of a player for us but imo the writing is on the wall for him here
who was that dickhead on the bengals talking shit has he played a snap
dolphins now down 143
oh god theyre kicking a fg someone hide the knives from wink
if the browns somehow lose to mason rudolph and miss the playoffs they will reach apex lolcow


it just would not get any funnier than that
lack of yannick evident today on the pass rush its hard to believe we got by before he got here
some of these clown ass reporters were really acting like the bengals were gonna win
dobbins and lamar are a fucking lethal combination
the ravens have now rushed for 230 or more yards in four of their last five games baltimoreluke

jk dobbins just set the ravens rookie record for total touchdowns in a single season 8 and the ravens set the franchise record for rushing touchdowns in a single season 23 ryanmink

dobbins now has a rushing td in six straight games to close regular season jeffzrebiec
reminder the steelers recently lost to this team
lol at all the talk on rnfl about the bengals being the ultimate spoilers wishful thinking
well that makes up for everything lmao
referees mad about that one
marlon running down the ball carrier makes that play possible he nearly stripped the ball too hes such an impact player from the corner position
nope over for them
this team beat the steelers
if huntley breaks a big run lets all go streaking
is there some way we can lock our team in a bubble so they dont get sick before the playoffs
this will be harbaughs 9th playoff appearance in 13 years
watching the bungles cheer lol fucking bums
huntley doesnt even know the damn plays
god damnit huntley looks absolutely lost out there on these called runs so damn close to getting it
why are these commentators so fucking clueless the ravens are only like 30 yards from breaking one of the most sacred records in nfl single game history and they are talking about random bullshit
great td call but omg how in the fuck did hollywood drop that ball

that was one of lamars best deep passes of his career btw lamar has seemingly worked on his trajectory as of late hes putting a bunch of air under the ball now
illegal shift not on us
lamar just learned something new about deflections love to see him get experience hopefully he can adjust
did hollywood not expect that pass lmao
way to go hollywood
crazy that we can be winning 170 in the 2nd quarter and be more dominant than the score indicates
jackson was just too good

never thought i will ever hear this from an announcer
we gonna be watching the ravens on nick next week
ravens are completely dominating the bengals through the first half sgellison

score 173
first downs 133
time 2200 800
yards 25862
averett learning what football is wasnt something i expected but i love it
green nah i think im done this year fam
i dont know about yall but im having fun
give lamar his 1000 for the season please
lamar 1k szn lets go
woooooo lamar
ok that should be it for lamar today
the ref getting in peters face wtf
i hope that was a touchback
hahahahahahahahahaha fuck the bengals fuck germain pratt and fuck the fucking sus refs
yeah peters show those refs whos boss
throw a flag on that shitty ref

greens not getting that record no matter how much you want to help him
pratt got stiff armed
jermaine pratt highlight
if we play the titans i hope we run the score up like no other
ravens have 350 rushing yards in the 3rd quarter alltime record is 423 we could be watching history
the new york giants have the most rushing yards by a team in a game with 423 yards against the baltimore colts on november 19 1950
when you see hunt we aint gonna punt bitch

tyler huntley probably
58 more yards is doable we can do this
my dudes there is still so much time left
fuck it im going in for 100 yards
nice to have an absolute stressfree beat down before the inevitable playoff heart palpitations next week
galaxy brain huntley gave the bungles the ball back so juiceman can pick a deep pass so we can get more rushing yards
we need jackson back in
lamar jackson throws the football

announcers can lamar jackson throw the football
ingram really is washed
were 22 yards away from the alltime single game rushing record
i feel like we lost i wanted that record lol
averett is the prime example of why you have patience with draft picks
dude when lamar is confident he is the best qb in the league

go ahead and fuckin me
ray rice 20 on the field
peters is getting back at everyone with that pick fucking right
hahahaha peters with the immediate revenge
ref flag

peters and i took that personally
who else has butterflies
bengals are missing their top 2 cbs dont be surprised if we take some deep shits early
i know everyone is suddenly pissed at roman but it was the holding call that fucked us

unpopular opinion maybe but we just moved down the field relatively easily and taking a ton of time off if we keep doing that and giving defense a ton of rest while wearing out their defense its a recipe for success
opi and an injured player ooooph
boykin has straight up been better than brown absolutely hilarious and pathetic at the same time
69 yard touchdown drive

nice
isnt it a bit ironic for the nfl to hold the moments of silence for covid victims while having fans at the game lol
do people outside of us know who gus edwards is hes legit one of the better backs in the league
i really hope we can keep gus no idea what his price will be or what well be willing to pay

were so fortunate to have such amazing running backs
lamar like fuck you im staying out here lol
quick passing plays romans evolving
holywood playing like a rollercoaster
peters is back out there talking shit

a welcome sight
wink martindale fucking pissed right now
i wonder how a nickelodeon broadcast would handle a gruesome injury
i want revenge on the titans so bad cant stand how arrogant theyve gotten
justin tuckers wife i swear to god you better not get us royal farms chicken for dinner again weve been eating it for 9 days in a row now

jt switches letters around no worries i brought home foyal rarmsuhfried turkey
lamars goal today zero punts
lamar jackson needs 22 more yards for 1000
read the fucking flair
freaking love that kid
oh lawd lamar comin for the afc
dobbins is going to be great for this franchise
referees hate him
the entire sub just nutted
lmao are you seriously challenging this

fuck off dude lets put up 50 on them
theyre already dead
aye whats that single game rush record ppl we need that right now cant let the opportunity go to waste
this is valuable time for huntley awesome he gets a whole quarter of live game action
i dont wanna hear any greg roman slander unless he actually fucks up in the playoffs
huntley looks awful and this is garbage time
this is painful to watch huntley runbounce around lol
im really happy for chuck what a fucking stud we found
let us hang 424 on you bengals
there is only one lamar jackson well theres 2 but ya know what i mean
bungals really scored 6 points against us all year lmao
i wish the bengals werent in our division i want to root for joe burrow when he comes back
can they at least zoom in on the damn replay how can we see what happened from up there
brown needs to catch a football 1000 times a day its getting ridiculous with drops from a round 1 draft pick
boykin really starting to turn things around the 2nd half of this season
great throw boykin out here vying for marquises spot
lamar is on point on his deep shots today it seems love to see it too bad none of his deniers will ever watch this game
brown damn almost had it
boykin hold my dick
jackson is 2 for 2 on the longball today browns drop is completely on him not lamar
i hope they tell me that ricard weighs over 300 pounds a few more times
seeing another team get flagged for an illegal shift or formation o
illegal shift thats not on us
genuinely i dont get hollywood brown getting the drops all the sudden he was insane in college watched him roast wvus secondary over and over again
who else think most of the bengals fans only showed up for a chance to watch lamar
shoutout bozeman for throwing gus for some extra yardage lmao
i missed the first quarter but see marquise the soulja brown dropped yet another long ball excellent
lamar needs 64 more yards for 1000
big girth chungus edwards
good play by board to use the boundary
board has been having a crazy quiet season but developed in a big way very curious who our starting two at ilb will be between him queen harrison and fort next year
jk all day
haha weekly illegal formation penalty god we need to fix that in the offseason
illegal formation
only reason that was caught is because brown had to drop himself
love that brown can come back from his mistakes
people talk about fatigue but really those are the type of drives that break a defenses will

its just as mentally damaging as it is physically
if you want a shutout in the nfl you have to earn that shit wrap up your fucking tackles
that was all marlo right there
imagine a player in the wild card game on nick breaks their leg and then gets fucking slimed
i am upset at that good time to work ok 2 minute drill
so with the way things are going and expected to go were either playing the titans if they win or if the texans win were playing the colts
safe to say baltimore will be playing the titanscolts position round 1 miami is just fodder at this point
dobbins gonna fuck around and become my favorite raven i can feel it
hollywood jumping in to help bozeman push the pile is a potential meme format
announcers sound like rmadden complaining about op plays you can just run jackson 15 times a game and win
who was that bengals player talking trash on twitter
dobbins now holds the records for ravens rookie rush tds
so what round of the fantasy draft are we all taking jk dobbins next season lads
i like how judon began transforming into a chicken at the end of that last down
time for lamar to get 1k
the most browns thing ever would be to lose and miss playoffs
browns really peaked on us and we still beat em lol
more
hollywood you confusing magnificent sonofagun

big truss woo woo
defense always seems to fall apart at the end of the game smh
peters lulling them into a false sense of security with the penalties lol
lmao

fuck you fuck your moral victories and fuck your momentum
back to us looking like a top 5 college playing a no name school
so its looking like were going to play the titans
i want revenge so bad on the titans for this year and their antics on our home shield for last year in the playoffs and because vrabel is an absolute piece of trash
jk dobbins over 800 yards with 9 tds in his rookie season and all that after barely getting any touches the first quarter of the season and even now still being in a rotation with edwards
taylor is the most loser ball coach in all of the nfl what are you even going to gain on a challenge there lol
how can they even review this our guy should have been able to continue to return it but they blew the entire play dead
thanks for wasting everyones time bud
34 yards

edit 32 yards
i want this record so fucking bad imagine the fear this will instill in playoff teams
love bozeman always giving 110 down the field
that was a really bad play i believe in next drive though need 25 more
lol wish they picked up that 1st you know harbaugh went for it there as a response to zac taylors staff kicking that fg to take away the shutout from our defence the last time we played the bengals
just let hill run it huntley isnt doing it
i have a feeling harbs doesnt care about records
i think its safe to say ingram is absolutely cooked
boykin brown as of right now
lamar is fuckin on today that pass hit boykin perfectly in stride and even hollywoods drop was perfectly placed in stride between two defenders
came here to say im demoting the soulja to a drummer boy because hes the only one beating his drum
celebrate interception like they won the game go 3 and out
petition to rename the sub to rillegalformation
hollywood drops uncontested ball

also hollywood beats db catches kinda tough throw on the run and works the first

why
absolutely hate this conservative bullshit 3 tos and more than enough time to get tucker in range
thats such a peters back to back play scenario pi then int
just so im clear this is the same bengals team that beat the steelers
guys how you like my new t shirt design
if lamar got by that guy it was a td
feel bad for higgings but thank god for the opi
gus the bus as a receiver hollywood brown as a receiver
lamar cant throw
miles bighands boykin
69 yard drive nice
remember guys lamar cant throw s
verbal meme hollywood brown drake saying no
miles boykin drake saying yes
we stop them now and we start crushing their spirit
big boykin no little boykin
other teams get illegal shift penalties
all that girth
edwards all that girth


gus is salt of the girth you might say
sloppy sloppy gotta watch the low passes
holy shit hollywood destroyed that man
soulja stiffarm
oooof dobbins is nasty
i know its risky but im a dangerous guy dobbins was a fucking steal in the 2nd round
theres our illegal formation
thats gotta be the 685th illegal formation this year
there it is
its awesome to see josh bynes being a team captain despite being this being his first year with cincinnati

miss him
2337 total yards lol
with about 4 12 minutes left in second quarter ravens are outgaining the bengals 2557 yards also have possessed the ball for 2128 bengals have had the ball for only 406

per jeff
defense is a bit rusty all that time on the sidelines
can we talk about the name peerine
i dont know why bengals take a fg there thats a win for us
lamar needs 46 yards in the second half for back to back 1000 yard rushing seasons
i heard you like rushing
best way to cap lamars 1k rush would be another crazy ass run with a spin move or some shit

edit before yall come at me for jinxing it dw dw i knocked on wood
wow they really waited for the entire bengals team to be on top of duv to call forward progress
how we gonna keep gus dudes a must return no questions asked

lj1k
313 in the 3rd with 3 minutes
tyler huntley time
hollywood with that helmet looks like the old nhl cheat code when you could give players big heads
63 rushing yards and we got a second straight 3000 rushing yards season
they wont even show the replay of that pi joke
well pratt was correct after all ravens are done here
lmaoooo get fucked
peters says fuck them kitties
read the fucking flair
the steelers are the biggest phonies of all time
that hand off from huntley though
350 yards rushing lmaooooooooooo
who are the top 5 rookie running backs of all time

1 dobby
2 dobby
3 dobby
4 dobby
5 dobby

because he spits hot fire
great job by bowser he got juked but recovered and got him on the ground
after hearing shit about kyler being a better version of lamar most of the year im really hoping the rams d steps up today and he shits the bed lol cant help it
why are we bothering with a challenge here i wish the refs would go over and go really coach really with this lead
were going to cross 400 yards rushing this game

jesus christ
celebrating that stop when theyre down 35
just go forward thats a coachable moment
huntley blame of the game incoming
398 yards rushing so far today
this has turned into a preseason game
ravens sitting at 398 rushing yards at the moment of me typing this 25 away from tying the record
i want that record lol 24 more boys
is it just me or does harbaughs mask get bigger every week
justice hill was held but we all know they only call holds on the ravens
honestly good on harbaugh if taylor is gonna challenge the touchback like a bitch then harbaugh should get clark an int lol
mark ingram is done
dammit so close to the record but so far away
put dobbins back
ok put dobbins in for a 90 yard td
everyone acting like its ingrams fault when we have been running basically every play since lamar came out easier to stop it when you know thats coming
someone tell lamar the whole field is the redzone
46 passing tds 0 interceptions in the red zone during his career

we say it a lot regarding lamar jackson but thats so insane
lamar wants that 1000 bad lol
that holding call on fluker just killed us
yall really need to put some respect on averetts name hes been balling recently
17 play drive lol


demoralizing
hollywood has to drop 2 balls in order to charge up enough power for a sick tuddy catch
awful fucking play call
we just took like 7 minutes off the clock and marched down the field the penalty stalled us were good fellas
genuinely its shocking that fluker gets so many hold calls in a league that has basically told refs not to call holds this year
thats really two opis in a row the last play had opi too lol
oh god you hate to see it that scream
hearing a tough ass athlete scream like that is really haunting
i need to see that play again that looked like a horrific drop from brown
is this a number 1 receiver
69 yard drive nice
dez has done so much for miles
boykin is a true soulja
great throw by lamar but also one of the nicer plays ive seen from boykin
really encouraged by boykins improvement the past few weeks i wonder if dez has taught him some tricks or he just lit a fire under his ass when we signed him
wait other teams do illegal shifts too i thought that was our penalty
ravens special teams looking good today preparing my body for the moment the announcers mention harbaughs special past
its nice to see these penalties happen to other teams for a change
while theoretically great the lag playing from that distance on the big screen would be killer
gus girth edwards
if the same guy deflects consecutive passes it means something is becoming predictable
illegal formation penalties baltimore ravens
drink
what id like to know is if harbaugh roman or lamar feel any sort of embarrassment over the amount of illegal formation penalties
that was marcus peters coverage with the 10 yard cushion in a short yardage situation
hell yea coach lets go for it

man what a 3rd and 4th down sequence that was
the bengals have 4 minutes of possession beautiful
hollywood
now this is podracing
the bengals have had the ball for about 4 minutes is that a record
townsend is killing it on these holds
castillo is just hype to be out there first one in the endzone to greet hollywood love it
townsend mvp so far with the good holds
marquise is really good we just need to have another guy defenses respect maybe boykin can become that maybe we get it in the draft or fa maybe both
whens the last time we got an interception i want one
wink has to be pissed
defense gives up only 62 yards in a half and yall are like defense is collapsing
looking like if we hang on well play the titans really wanted to play pittsburgh
the dolphins live thread is melting down rn
averett might be our most improved player
anyone remember when a single coverage aj green down field like that was an instant td against us
green blinking morse code at the ravens sideline

needqbhelp
dobbins too easy
dezs block right there made me nut
i know we didnt give ray rice as many looks in his rookie year but dobbins looks better as a rookie than rr did
i am confident we can win the super bowl if we keep playing like this cant forget we are playing bad teams though
excited to watch lamar handing to dobbins the next 510 years
this team best the steelers two weeks ago huh lol
lets see how many bengals get there before we blow the whistle
lamar to soulja connection is going to be fire next year how can they not put in a shit ton of work together this offseason seeing hollywood fight thru the yips has me feeling a lot more confident
lamar on 1000 yard rushing seasons

ill fucking do it again
fuck your update show the stat
1000
ok huntley time
and the hay is in the barn
brown is proving us all wrong
that it thats it sit everyone

season is over
brown and jk synchronized dancing makes me real hopeful for the future of the franchise

mp juiceman bitch
lmao why yall throwing it
fuck yeah peters thats for that no facemask call fuck you refs
aj green looks so done lmfao
jk dont joke
lmao he did it the fucking madman
germaine pratt twitter
that looks exactly like the ray rice run on the first play against the pats in the playoffs uncanny
trap game for sure trapped my wiener against my zipper
after jk dobbins long touchdown run the ravens have 350 rushing yards on 40 carries the third quarter is not over yet aaronkazreports
love the sight of sad bengals

go fucking tweet again random linebacker or whoever you are
ravens are 77 rushing yards away from breaking the record for most rushing yards in a game ever
that was a ray lewis sack from pq48
even though i would rather play the steelers beating the titans in the playoffs would be so fucking satisfying
im hoping we dont abandon the rushing game plan during the post season the whole team especially lama feed off of it
this is bullshit moore picked it up and ran with it how can you call the play dead when they never had possession moore is fully allowed to grab it and run as he did

edit i meant with the challenge if they could somehow overturn it it erases moores return
lmao zac taylor trying to challenge this like the bengals are in this game
well if we start at the 1 we can get even more rushing yards
put lamar back in just to clown these mfs
53 more yards
lets go for the record 77 yards should be doable

edit 64 yards now
damn huntley
if lamar was in this game still im glad he isnt though wed break the record lol
pad the stats
that play sucked but im okay with it weve basically got a quarter of preseason time to experiment and see what works albeit with backups
i really want that alltime rush record lol
one of those rare zero stress playoff clinchers i could get used to this
huntley is 100 not lamar
did tucker just boom out a punt
bills got 49
did i ever tell you john harbaugh was a special teams coach
guys we arent getting that record
go for it on fucking 4th idgaf lol
just give duvernay an end around i would love to break the record with a wr
f for the record
love the bengals fans coming in here to bitch yall scored 6 points on us in 2 games congratulations
feeling sad that we didnt get the record but we just won 383 in a revenge game and clinched our playoff spot and this team is now red hot
all that celebrating you did earlier got you where
thats a seasondefining drive right there my goodness
brown how are you gonna get the yips again

someone give this man some fucking ayahuasca or something so he can talk to the ancient football god of not dropping the damn ball
i am throbbin for dobbins
refs see the ravens on their schedule and bring the extra flags
john harbaugh special teams
our cbs looked like they were running through water trying to catch him good lord
oh man hope higgins is ok that was a nasty looking pull
he was screaming in pain fuck
hate to see it and hear it man prayers up to him scream got me grimacing too
i really hope hes ok never want to see a player go down with an injury regardless of who we play
boykin wouldve caught that
that was a gorgeous pass
take notes marquise
bro lamar is so good
dez lit a fire under boykins ass lol
lamar makes those throws look so effortless
atta boykin
boykin has been a beast since lamar got back
boykin starting to looooooook goooooood
i kinda think dez is starting to rub off on boykin hes played better since dez has got here
boykin looking like he having a little break out season for the past 5 weeks dudes been balling
held my breath for the dpi call
oh what was that ravens are a good team go oooonnnnnnnnnnnn
hey thats usually the flag we get
trace mcsorley song beethoven
imagine lamar with a top 10 receiver beside him good lord we would be winning super bowls
lol bozeman just threw gus for an extra three yards
all that girth
edwards all that girth
tyre philips picked up that ball and was ready to run it again lmao
really would like 5 ints today off this future car salesman
allen will be working at autozone in a few years
defense is locked tf in
really like that short pass to brown we have that available a lot and we never do it
yo gus has gotten so much better hes no longer just a straight line runner
gus edwards is all meat and potatoes
a tacklebreaking son of a gun
real love affair between this announcer and gusto
and there it is
i go to rutgers for law school and all i want is a gus edwards rutgers jersey
im going to be honest i dont want to see ingram playing during the playoffs
surprised we havent gone back to boykin after the td
isnt it sad how the giants can be 610 and make it
lamar is ridiculous
brown looks like when ea adds the elfs into madden that are 2 tall
jackson mad

i love it
hollywood you hung onto it
hollywood
17 play 93 yard drive unbelievable i love that
ball back and 2min drill score please
what a torturous drive for the bengals 17 plays of pounding
its over for baltimore
get my boy lamar some rushing yards less than 50 away from the record
not excited to face the titans but payback for last year would be nice
would be nice if we could get to the qb
jk slob on my dobbins is the first offensive player i feel lamar has that can consistently go out and get his own everyone else needs lamars play making most of the time jk would eat with or without lamar imo obviously hes feasting more with lamar heres to hoping lamar gets some stud playmaking receivers soon
im used to seeing small ass peanut in number 48 still getting used to seeing monster queen in that uni lol
bengals wrecked another nfl team last week and im mad we gave up 3 points spoiled fan base
i really really hope the ravens arent the nick broadcast game

can you imagine losing after watching your team covered in slime and having googly eyes
i despise tyler boyd
averett is fucking everywhere like whenever ive seen a play today aa is right there

good shit
if averett had a pick 6 there this sub wouldve exploded
if aa continues to improve having all 4 of our cbs healthy will be scary
when averett plays anything that isnt 9 yards off hes legit bump and run press bail hes got speed to run with anyone and hes physical they need to ink that extension before he hits the open market
i want the steelers to win just to be able to meme the browns i know its sacrilegious to say that but imagine if after all of 2020 the browns still brown
jackson is like i smell 1000 designed run yo
so they just said lamar is only about 30 yards away from having two seasons of 1k yards rushing ans thats with sitting two full games thats mind blowing
dez bryant with the quality blocking
this has to be demoralizing for the defense lol
llama and dobby
amazing hold by townsend on that xp hes been a machine today
lamar jackson is now 2 yards shy from becoming the first qb in nfl history to have multiple 1000 yards rushing seasons jeffzrebiec
i know its not technically their division but the jets deserve the nfc east playoff spot
aj green cant hurt us anymore
thank god were winning
nope over for them
im literally the kylo ren meme rn screaming for us to keep pounding these bengals even more lol
if we face the titans again i dont want to see any ravens player tweeting about derrick henry
another soulja stiffarm
hell yeah love these hollywood stiff arms
witnessing history with lamar the best is yet to come boys
soulja
how is brown so good in the red zone when hes so tiny lol
its so smart building up browns confidence going into the playoffs
those quick little passes that gain 5 yards or so are something weve been missing for a couple years now
soulja sighting
marquise hollywood soulja brown
imagine losing to this team lmaooo
corporal hollywood
lamar is so calm rolling out the pocket
elliot totally failed on that play
marlon back hurts from carrying so hard
marlo still going for fruit punch haha
heres the part where the defense makes some really stupid plays at the end of the game
this ref looks like such a prick
jesus christ thank god for marlon
how is it dpi if ball isnt catchable its way out of bounds
refs you scored 3

bengals and how many did i need to win

refs 3

bengals wooooohooooo

refs 2

bengals huh

refs you needed 32 points to win you scored 3
peters with the revenge int
where the hell is peters going but pick
tf are these refs on lmao
damn nice play by peters right there
lmao bungles
oh how the turn tables
lmaoo they thought
peters pulling a forest gump after the play
hahhaahahhaahahahahahhahaa what a buncha scrubs
so can we just play marcus peters as our wr1
talk yo shit peters fuck that ref
350 yards rushing so far

holy shit
jk literally boosted off that defender lmao
jesus save some points for next week
dobbins best pick in the draft
i want the titans ass on wildcard weekend
ray lewislike timing by queen
great tackle by bowser
only 280 more rushing yards to break our own nfl record lets get it lol
the nfl record for rushing yards in a game is 423
i kinda want the record but also want them to save dobbins and gus legs
i wanna steamroll titans by 90
cmon taylor youre down 35 man
this is one of the most dominant games ive seen the ravens play in a long time

this is an absolute beat down
just run run run i want to see if we break the record or not
umm the single game yardage record is in fucking play guys
fuck the titans
these sad ass bengals fans
i dont think harbaugh wants the record lol
good lord 510 yards of offense
huntley shouldve followed ingram there
no punt continues lol

worth turning it over on downs lol
wtf was that lol
i aint even mad lmao
cant believe people were concerned about this game at all
huntley if you get us the rushing record youre on the starting roster next year harbs probably
can we please stop trying to hurt our backup qb
uh is huntley having a stroke
not one mention of the fact that we could break the single game rushing record but sure lets do a expose on the few bad plays lamar has made in the playoffs
stop running huntley give it to the rbs
im so selfish i want that record
id like them to let huntley try a pass
28 rushing yards is all that seperates us from that record now i have a feeling we wont get it but still considering modern day nfl and even though its against the bengals thats still a great accomplishment
fuck it spot them the points so we can get the record
we really gonna miss out on the record because we gave tyler huntley 5 carries lol
ngl didnt know chuck clark had a beard
23 yards for the record lets get it
put in ryan finley you cowards
put jk in get the record baby
clark finally ends the drought
lets fucking go come on were so close
just let lamar and dobbins run a qb counter bash for the record ez money
huntley dropped his stock quite a bit this quarter mcsorely is much more confident with the ball
baltimore ravens special teams legend chris moore
this was a good sunday on to the next one lads
hope higgins is alright dude is a baller
boykin finally developing i dont think its any coincidence that both boykin and hollywood have been better since dez got here
lol total yards
bal 138
cin 2
illegal shiftoh boynot on the ravenshell yeahhh
this is america i can line up however i want

greg roman
this sub is going from f hollywood to lets go hollywood
some eagles fans are really trying to say jalen hurts is better than lamar lmao
why not take a shot
win and in

lets fucking do this
boykin catching with his hands and not his body

3 weeks in a row ill say it again
boykin brown
watching andrews drawing 3 defenders to free boykins is hilarious
knock on wood but holy hell this bengals team looks bad without burrow i mean they were not a great team yet with him but that kid brought a spark
the football is almost as big as hollywood
get lamar 1k and put in huntley i wanna watch that man again
fuck tennessee we coming in hot motherfucker
no snead sucks hes good for a crucial catch or two every game
i hate playing the bengals in week 17 even my homies get nervous
lol colon castillo is starting not skura
lamar is prolly tired af rn
really hope higgins is okay non contact injuries are always scary
shocker block in the back ravens
okay that was a great fucking throw what the fuck
that throw though
lamar is on point today
yes boykin looks fucking great recently
what a dime what a play
miles boykin is officially a soulja
boykin has improved a little over the year he can be good with timedez can help him get there
yall just call whoever caught the last td pass our best receiver ok
what a dime
boykin been ballin out lately
god i hate these amazon stat commercials
wait the other team can get an illegal shift penalty
dont love that justice hill gets snaps on third down
defense looks legit lets go boys
when you do absolutely nothing on offense for multiple drives in a row get a crucial turnover then gain three yards and punt on the next drive

bungles gonna bungle
alright we gotta stop playing around first the chunk play by higgins than an int sooner or later the bengals will start converting on these plays we cant be going into the playoffs with these type of mistakes bad play by lj there was a lot of green grass he could have got an easy first down
guys i think wink is seriously holding that grudge from the bengals fg earlier this season
imagine getting stiff armed by hollywood
i do not want to travel to buffalo
andrews and hollywood in peak playoff form
might as well keep running it down their throats
thats a girth down
i love mark ingram but this isnt a damn personality competition at some point he needs to get back to his shit
illegal formation again damn it i thought we were cured
name a better duo than the ravens and the illegal formation
there it is
what happened to fluker
the soulja is back in the game
i dont know the stats but i know its true that lamar has to be 100 on 4th down his career when he waves off the special teams
20 v 4 minutes top lmao
we are due for an x soon
cringe josh bynes in cincinnati orange
soulja
soulja boy tell em
hollywood in the slot
andrews looked like he should have had that or at least a chance did he even see it
17 plays god damn
props to the holder
i would love to hear what peters was saying there
i miss elite suggs
what is with the bengals and scoring some garbage ass field goal against us that doesnt help
zac smith just quit on his team lmao
good first half need a 3 and out to start the 2nd and a score put this away
so i guess when zac taylor sees baltimore up next he just goes fuck it its a loss what a pathetic hc
jfc josh allen and the bills are so damn good
funny hearing audibles from bengals qbs and it not materializing anyway lmao
does dobbins ever get tackled or does he always just get slowed down to a stop elf things
nice block down field by dez
you smell that im starting my festivus ham
if u kick the extra point over the net that should be 2
get in there bitch
dobbins is really really good

like future 1st2nd team all pro good as a runner if he can become a beast in the passing game he will definitely garner such an honor down the line
i just dont aee the argument of keeping hurst over dobbins
this is the greatest rushing offense in modern nfl history we gotta start speaking on that
cant stand tosubut i do appreciate them for dobbins the guy is such a dynamic runner
shit if roman used dobbins more in the beginning of the season he would have a td like every game
judon
i love wink staying aggressive af even with a lead
this cincy o is obviously really bad we know that but they scored almost 40 points on houston last week and houstons d isnt that great but this type of domination cant be understated
lamar scramble for 3 yards then huntley szn
safe to say judon wants a pick lol dat scream
pull lamar it is huntley snz
i love lamar jackson like hes my son
browns are so shite
gus is skrong
gus breaks tackles like a madden player its absurd
now its 109 browns

winning by 1 one point 2 at home 3 against a team resting starters 4 when your playoff berth is on the line

pathetic
over 68 on lamar rushing yards today was a criminal betting prop
nopunts

ok start sitting people especially our quarterback
i want stephen a to watch this game to see how hes gonna say lamar cant throw now
remember hollywood was like one of the only dudes who showed up in the playoffs last year if he continues this and our team does too i have high hopes
for the love of all that is good and holy in the world please take lamar out of this game
koch out and we havent needed to punt anyway lmfao
almost got that ball out fruit punch
peters goin home go bed
that pick is refs fault lol
i feel like thats the first pick in a long time
ok marcus i forgive you
thats a soulja right there
why did i think peters stepped out on the 1 there
talk yo shit peters
that running back still beating his chest
germaine pratt twitter link
some say peters is still running
peters with the metaphoric middle finger to the zebras love it
id pull jk too
lamar hit 1k yards again missing an entire game and sitting down early yet again
we have 4 rbs get dobbins out of there please
i have ascended
huntley time baby
jk got easy yards there lmao bengals look so defeated i love to see it
50 more rushing yards for 400
38 points in the 3rd wow
germaine pratts career

0 sacks

0 int

0 ff

7 qb hurries

18 missed tackles

830 completion percentage 86 yr 1153 qb rating 3 td when targeted

50 pff grade
dobbins is such a great mix of physical traits
peters mad he didnt get to rest longer
350 rush yards
fuck it buying a dobbins jersey
jk dobbins is a bona fide stud
shit i wanted pitt first round damnit
as i said before dobbins has all pro talent as a runner all he needs to do is polish up his receiving skills to jump into the top tier of rbs

he is very good in pass pro already
that bengals rb was like fml when those two gap penetrations occurred



i love peters he went to sit right next to lamar hes such a character
so who gets player of the game the whole team right
nfl record for most team rushing yards in a single game is 423 which the new york giants had against the baltimore colts in 1950

ravens are 74 yards away with a quarter left to play

ryan mink
nfl record for most team rushing yards in a single game is 423 which the new york giants had against the baltimore colts in 1950
ravens are 74 yards away with a quarter left to play ryanmink
im drafting dobbins first round next year idc
give me a 50berger and the alltime singlegame rushing record
let them we get it at the 1 and get 99 rushing yards
back us up 10 yards gives us 10 more rushing yards on the stats
suppose they say that the ball did not enter the endzone where do the ravens get the ball not fair they did not get the chance to return it
thanks for wasting our time zac
fyi the alltime nfl team record for rushing yards is not 423 its 426 and it was by the detroit lions vs the pittsburgh pirates on november 4 1934

edit source of the detroit team record page 291
justice hill we going for that rushing record arent we
holy shit we might actually do it
oh we getting that record today
according to pfref the baltimore ravens are just the 16th team in history to rush for over 375 yards in a game and the first since adrian petersons recordsetting day fbgchase

statheadcom
thats a miscommunication of the highest order
wtf was that
dumb play call or some major miscommunication
alright still plenty of time to get 26 more
4th and inches is time for the gus bus fuck it theyre up 35
bengals won their super bowl on that 4th down
the 426 yards team rushing record was set in 1934

ravens are at 398

but the record since 1951 is 407by the bengals in 2000
someone somewhere is in a weird team rushing scoring week 17 championship league and is currently having a fucking stroke watching the ravens rushing offense
hayden hurst td
thanks cbs i almost forgot about our playoff losses
cmon hunt just run around the people not into em
is there going to be an after game cage match between wink and zac taylor id watch that on pay per view honestly
give dobbins one more touch and well get the record
pull huntley its jackson szn
huntley looks slow compared to the jags game
let them score

let them score

let them score
wait harbaugh was a st coach
now that the commentators arent even talking about the game anymore i feel like im listening to a podcast or the radio
bills could win the sb but that depends on josh allen ppl shit on lamar in the playoffs but allen was atrocious in the playoffs nobody talks about it though
why is there a 17 on defense lol
this is payback for taylors dumbass challenge
challenge it lol get chuck that pick
announcers are slobbering all over harbaughs cock and i love it lol
that was a pick
these refs have had very few chances to fuck with this game and theyre still doing their damnedest
that was so obviously a pick lmao how do you miss that
pretty bad look for that ref standing ten feet away watching the play
thats a clear pick lmao you morons these stupid refs need glasses
come on break the record fuck
we aint getting the record
cmooooon one play to make history down to our last chance right here
oh and i just realized its almost 5am here ure fuckin worth it bmore i love yall
asst coach told clark they ruled it an int

clark walking away nodding his head yeah i know it was an int
this feels like watching jamal try to break the single season record
anyone else just love when they show the playoff graphics and the patriots arent anywhere on it
is it bad that i still want the browns to lose so badly even after we cliched
id love to see browns go 3 and out and steelers to sonehow get a fg to knock them out lol
win and were in

no scoreboard watching no rooting for other teams today is only about our game

truzz been a pleasure
what a stupid fucking play we run that on like 75 of our third and longs
fuck that scream from higgins
theres 168 hours every single week when do my friends and relatives contact me for computersmart phone support recipes next weeks plans christmas presents when during the most important 3 hours of my week
see boykin can fucking catch
boykin showing hollywood how to catch
am i wrong or did the pass to brown hit his chest
gotta say that boykin and dezs friendship just warms my heart dez building up boykins confidence is exactly what he needs
cant be mad about that 1st q ladies and gents
announcer gus is just potatoes

gus uh thanks i think
chancellor goodell illegal formations are our specialty
the chiefs pay tons of money to keep mahomes surrounded by talent you dont cheap out on offense with a franchise qb pay andrews period
souljas taketh souljas giveth
was andrews looking for his mom in the stands or what gotta turn around dude
lol before the game they said a bengals key to victory was to hold us under 150 rushing we now have 158
gotta admit i was hard on averett but he has stepped up lately
lamar has a couple incomplete passes and youd think this sub just found out the world was ending jesus christ
its so annoying that the hollywood drop is gonna affect lamars outside the numbers deep ball stats when that was a great throw people only look at the stats
germaine praitt with the coverage
yo did averett learn how to fucking play football
gus bus has g i r t h
did dobbins just break the rookie td record
i would greatly appreciate a win today hot take i know
god i just want a big win today no close heart attacks please k thx

if brandon allen keeps us out of the playoffs well idk man i just dont know
i know its not burrow playing today but i had to rewatch the sack compilation on him from the last time we played was so satisfying to watch

x200b

oh and fuck them for kicking that fg lets beat their asses tonight and get into the playoffs hot
cbs really trying to jynx us
good shit dobbins on throwing that block there
lol theres the roman we all know and love s
shit play call stop using justice fucking hill while mark is getting carries 3 rb rotation is already too much basically
guys g ro is calling these repetitive plays so they dont have tape for the playoffs big brain time
that 3rd down play was a touchdown if the end rusher misses the tackle look at the blockers we had down field
damn higgins hope hes good
nfl just needs to ban turf at this point it causes so many more avoidable injuries
i cannot fathom how these dudes blatantly block in the back every special teams play
catch da fucking ball
name a better duo 1st rd draft pick wrs for the ravens and dropped passes
imagine if lj had a legit wr1 this team would be unstoppable
brown reminds me of chris davis after he wasnt allowed to take adderall anymore
i can not believe marquise dropped that
another wr who is only fast and cant catch passes at the nfl level send him to the jets with perriman
i fucking love gus edwards hes starting to shed that one trick pony moniker been catching passes and blocking real well down field
thats two super accurate long passes from jackson
boykin low key clutch
people really watch lamar play and say he sucks
lamar must have been watching that ohio state game
just guard hollywood and andrews they said


lets fucking go boykin
lamars deep pass is getting better every week
that boy kin ball
boykin not a star yet but hes definitely figuring some shit out this year and lamar is trusting him
god that brown drop is even worse from that angle
gus becoming more than just a bus is one of my favorite things this season
edwards all that girth lmao
all that girth

that was a nice stick
i feel bad for the dad in the rocket mortgage commercial there is no reason why larry fitzgerald didnt catch that ball before it hit the lamp its just a poor effort on a hall of famer
what the hell is up with the back to back batted passes
why the fuck is he throwing the ball so low for
why is the defense celebrating lmao wow you finally did something cool
it can never be easy can it lol
lol we had like 3 guys wide open on that pick jesus christ
love the bengals fans saying lamar is a bad qb in their game thread
hollywood with a stiff arm
holy fuck imagine getting stiff armed by brown
fucking drop city today
dobbins made that look so easy
welp there it is 134 rushing over 2800 for the season
2nd and 1 and ingram gets no gain its weird how much hes regressed and no one knows why
as is tradition
theres your weekly illegal shiftformation penalty
there it is everybody take shots
illegal formation classic
lol there it is
we should just start celebrating it at this point
alright gro ingram cant even pick up that 2nd and 1 very clearly you shouldnt even bring him in for short yardage situations lets put this shit to rest
as much as i love ingram we need to keep him on the side
how many illegal formation penalties do we have all season i bet its more than any other team
can harbs bring someone in to teach these guys how to line up because clearly no one knows how to
jfc
even though he didnt get a first down that was awesome
soulja
love that fire lj
good soulja
lmao andrews looks so strange without facial hair
lamar pushing special teams off the field
lamar had that hell yeah coach lets go for it look on his face
i love when lamar hops up and immediately is telling the sideline to go for it
man lol that possession time is ridiculous
big dick swagger lets go lamar
i love when lamar calls the shots
that makes up for the drop
hollywood ball security redemption
from bollywod to hollywood real quick
oline held up well against that all out blitz
17 plays sheeesh
has anyone pointed out that harbaugh used to be a special teams coach yet
this is what i like to see at the end of the season effortless domination lets keep this up for another month
remember when the steelers were losing 170 to this team
remember when the ravens could beat any team but could also lose to the winless dolphins so much easier to watch a team that dismantles bad teams and sells the parts in ebay
wonder what its like to be a guy like townsend you know youre only here for likely one game and then either cut or put on the practice squad it must be kinda weird im trying to imagine me doing that for my job lol
were on pace to play steelers in round 1

edit nm im dumb
they got a first down
total yards update
bal255
cin7
peters brave talking to that big ass viking looking dude like that lol
been strange having a better offense then d its still hard for me to understand lol
so much for locked in defense look like they went for cheeseburgers that last offensive drive
like this o line is shit and got burrow killed but we cant get penetration and pressure we need rushers so bad
buffalo crushing miami
i swear sometimes our offense keeps the ball so long which im not complaining about our defense forgets they have to play
1 good wr and 1 good edge rusher is all i want in the draft maybe a new guard
take another fg zack you coward
i want to see us push for a fg before half
alright lets give townsendtucker a shot with these 32 seconds
they really kicked a fg
fantastic coverage by humphrey to avoid the pick by the wr
just a reminder that we never unclench here even up 2 scores at half
misheard the verizon commercial as 100 would have sex with the mandelorean instead of obsessed with im losing it
so its likely we are going to tenn town i want to fuckinn destroy them
i want eagles to win tonight so much just to see 610 giants at 4th seed lmfao
id be happy with ten or pit we need payback either team
so if the bills and browns win today we play the titans or colts who ever wins their game tonight
tennessee rematch weve been waiting a year for this
miami getting fleeced omg
announcers love anthony averrett
seriously im feeling bad for cincy with all these injuries
an green isnt nearly as good as he used to be
is bozeman now the only lineman that hasnt been penalized today lmao
dobbins is so shifty just like lamar i love it
dobbins is so much fun to watch
lamar is going for 1k
lol 2 more yards
dobbins is a fuckin fighter man
dobbins eating
our oline creates absolutely giant holes they are so under appreciated
power grace and skill all on display
the counter bash run game is really taking off rn bengals played it pretty well first half but theyre losing control
dobbins is love dobbins is life
bruh i just woke up how did i miss the first half
i think i know why lamar threw the pick all of our drives are scores the end of the half or the pick

its to keep the punter off the field well played
get lamar 1000 yards then rest him up
judon u good mate
aj greens body language says it all
sad wink wont get his revenge shut out
and there is the 1000
there it is 1000 yards
did lamar break 1000 again
lamar jackson is the father of the bengals
there it is
1k llama

what a special player
another girth down for the gus bus
ravens need 63 more on the ground for 3000
crazy to have this qb on the ravens lamar is amazing
hollywood is back
what patience what a play
good thing we signed that guy to hold for tuckers extra points
insert soulja boy meme

bengals
game blouses
germaine pratt where you at you punk ass bitch
damn spero already called the game for us
lets revisit the comment in the bengals sub that lamar cant throw
270 rushing yardswe can do this
after the amount of times this week they showed the bengals comeback to knock us out in 2017 this feels good
give us a jackson 5 before huntley comes in
if we do face the titans as it likely seems we will we can beat them if we play like this
art and ray
joker cmon man
i hate spot of foul interference more than anything in football
second half defence activated
that wasnt pi imo

im counting that as a great rep from averett
lmao glorious
thats exactly the energy we need
ball dont lie
in the words of the great band jethro tull its a bungle in the jungle
he couldve taken that for a pick 6 man good move stepping out for the touchback though
that pick was sexy af
ball dont lie
ball dont lie
bungles with a 1st and goal at the 1 yard line and marcus peters with the int after back to back questionable pass interference calls

thats so bungles
ok bengals were donejk lol
jk all goddamn motherfucking dayyyyyyy
dobby is a free elf
thats my running back
dobby gonna lead the league in rushing next year
he go z o o m
we all knew a big run from dobbins was coming eventually he and lamar are going to be a combo for years to come
we want tennessee
dooooooooooooooooobins

thats for yall bitch ass refs
how many rbs went ahead of dobbins
lmao bengals just dont care
drink and smoke up folks we goin to da playoffs
look at that 57 getting the shit stiff armed out of him

bum
lets hit 400 yards rushing fuck it
germaine pratt talked all that shit to get engulfed by a lineman and stiff armed by dobbins on his way to the longest run of his career
77 more yards and we break the single game rushing record
i cant believe jk was all the way to the second round despite being osus main back during the finals
how close r we to all time rushing yards in a game
germaine pratt twitter link
oh oh were dancing on the sideline

our swagger is baaaack
77 more yards to break team rush record lets get it
70 some yards away from the record of rushing yards by a team in a game
lamar is done for the day per zrebiec
okay pq
i know he still has room to grow but patty q is nice wit it
bowser ballin this year

i hope he stays
direct snaps to ingram in the 4th only
titans rematch vol 2
never been trolled by bengals fans until today not even in 17 didnt know they cared so much lmao
yeah this challenge will really make a difference
glad they wasted everyones time
roman run the ball dafuq we chasing records
whos the bungles lb who said they would make us miss the playoffs lmao
we quite literally have 6 rushing threats at all times could even through duv in there for 7
its looking like steelers vs browns next week would love it if the steelers go out after having rested their key starters
this is a college football level beat down holy shit
lmao when justice hill is gashing you consider your career choices
so are we playing the titans next week
we need 25 more yards for the rushing record
i dont even care that we didnt get that we have 10 minutes to get another less than 30 yards
if the browns dont make the playoffs i will be so fucking happy
reminder that the steelers lost to the bengals
just put in dobbins to break the record
huntley looking like its preseason a bit confused out there
bro huntley the fuck man
that was one hell of a punt by tucker and the announcers just ignored it

edit not tucker
not gonna break the record becuase huntley is completely lost smh lol
we need 25 yards as i should have done earlier we need to truzz
were close to an all time record and were letting a rookie qb stuff himself into the o line and a washed mark ingram do the same oof
watching huntley makes you appreciate lamars instincts
we arent getting the record with our backups in
just let them score lol we need the record
beating the titans in playoffs would be so satisfying cocky twats
good challenge john thats a pick
thats a pick dude
chuck clark earl thomas
ref looks pissed to have to review this lol just get it right the first time
harbs thank you youre making this challenge simply for clarks stat
get the record
feel like chuck has had so many almostinterceptions this season its almost fitting that we need to challenge on week 17 to get him his first
give us the record take 2
thats absolutely a pick lmao are we dealing with backup refs again
time to bust one off for the all time record
bro wink is evil remembered that field goal in last minute to stop the shut out if we keep this up bengals couldnt even score a td on us this year
love mark but he isnt getting it important thing is were playoff bound
for fucks sake if were gonna run it lets actually run it
mark ingram loves 1 or two yards man wtf happened
ingram is getting hit immediately in an obvious rushing scenario should have added a wrinkle to make space
what happened to ingram so slow
at this point i would rather see justice hill
rip sam kochs streak o7
huntley is ass he had the edge lol stop running into your linemen
run it townsend coward
damn the browns are garbage
at least the steelers lost
buffalo tore miami up holy shit
its all tough love soulja we just tryna bully you into playing better
peters please fuck stop them from gaining extra yards
lol anyone else see judon being dramatic af after that play went out of bounds
here we go guys lets do this thing
everyone hop in the playoff bus theres plenty of room
no ngakoue sucks i wanted to see him pop off today
we better win this shit by 50 im still pissed about 2017
god i hope we win please
fuck the steelers fuck the browns and fuck the bengals
lets put up 50 today gang
of course they start the broadcast with that bullshit from 2017
im pretty disappointed by the james proche situation tbh we traded up in the 6th to get this guy and then never really gave him a shot with the offense now hes a healthy scratch for the last two weeks of the season
take a shot every time they mention the 2017 game
is chris moore related to harbaugh or something
i know they was having flashbacks on that run hahaha
i really like duv
the lineup chart and the announcers said matt skura was starting at center for patrick meraki yet its tcc out there it must have been a very last minute decision for the ravens i guess even jeff zrebiec was caught off guard by it
did gus hair grow 5 inches in 1 week
dumb fucking call
things seemed kind of relaxed on that drive a lot of stuff was working but it seemed relaxed lets get the tempo up a notch
no koch makes me more nervous than any other player out rn
i want the browns to lose for schadenfreude
that pi adds insult to injury

hope that guys ok
yikes
thats just terrible a dude looks like he tears his hamstring on a play that is ultimately meaningless
oof from 1st and 10 on the opposite 40 to 3rd and 18 from their own 10
allen still grinning while his teammate is screaming in pain on the field wtf is wrong with the bengals
fuck hope higgins is okay prayers up
ill never understand why someone blocks in the back especially right in front the ref
gotta catch that brown but holy fuck did lamar just drop a nuke
oh boy were back to bollywood
its not a ravens game until we have a block in the back on a punt return and an illegal formation penalty on offense
thats why we need a true 1
we need a better wr1 play marquise in the slot
absolute dime come the fuck on soulja
this is why jackson runs he cant count on no one but himself to get shit done
inb4 soulja boy drops 4 catches and then has one big td play that gives us all hope
at this point if the team is considering drafting a wr can we just hold a fan vote or something lol im so sick of the wrs this team drafts
that pass was on the fucking money damn
literally a dime and he drops it again
i like that they didnt show us a close up of that nocatch
how did hollywood drop that what is it with our team that kills hands this guy never dropped anything in college
i can see for miles and miles
my god that was a beauty of a throw maybe make boykin our deep threat now he actually catches passes thrown directly to him
myles down the field
looking good on the long ball today
mandrews as the bait to bring down the safety
is it just me or has boykin improved a lot in the past few weeks
boykin better than brown
love to see boykin get it on with lamar lately
yessir
lamar cant throw
boykin has impressed me this season ngl
boykin tds are my favorite tds
its so obvious how much signing dez sparked a fire in the other recievers absolutely love that signing
respect for avrett fighting off that block hes really playing better lately
averett is somehow our best corner against the wr screen
wait they can call that on other teams
canadian here using dazn to stream your commercials are actually pretty good lol
anyone know where to get one of them cool ravenscolored maryland flaglooking face covering that harbaugh is wearing
g i r t h
girthy gus edwards
i must have missed a sentence of the commentary because now everyone is saying girth
8 different ravens have more yards the the bengals god damn
that time of possession though
we know where tyrees eyes went when he grabbed that ball rn
run it there lamar
justice hill was wide open
hollywood was wide open
good job defense
celebrating the only good thing theyll get outta the game lmao
soulja stiffarm
need a score and then we can run the clock out no need to let this team hang
i feel like lamar is messing with the bengals like he is not shifting into high gear doesnt want to give any playoff teams some tape to review
jacksons passes today are money but drops are fucking killers
run dobby run
gus just using that girth
yoo gus is a beast man love the bus
oof mark he just runs right to the defender gus and jk get skinny and pick up a first there
i just want lamar to have some legit weapons to throw too
i cant tell if ingram has really declined that much or if we just scheme worse when hes in the game
seems like a better time than any to bring up the fact that jk dobbins railed my girlfriends cousin
weekly illegal formation
ah i see the illegal formation came relatively early this week
we have 146 rushing yards in 21 mins of football lol
yessss illegal formation again
has any local reporter asked the coaches how illegal shift penalties keep occurring every game
now we are officially playing a ravens game
wait til an illegal formation brings back an important play in the playoffs this sub is gonna lose it
ingram in the backfield

its time to show yall im still the same player

gets the ball from lamar

its time to show the league what im made of

spin move

i cannot be stopped

stutter step

and ingram gets the carry and makes it back to the line of scrimmage second down and 10
okay tough throw but wtf was hollywood thinking he didnt need to run it what
the fact he even got yards lol
sweet
when lamar fucks up on 3rd down we always convert the 4th lol
lol lamar said i aint getting off the field
lamar is so fucking good
lamar jackson only needs 46 rushing yards for 1000
he sneak called lamar a running back smh
lfg hollywood
lamar is just so in control its unbelievable
soulja boy tell em
souljah boy tell em
soulja boy tell em
crank dat
i still absolutely love our momentum i hope thisll be enough to beat the big boys ie stillers and chiefs but im feeling really confident about our guys
this s a fun game to watch
germaine pratt talking shit before the game now you gotta be on the field for the whole 60 mins lol smh
wink really wants this shutout and my fantasy team needs it too
who was the bengals player that said its over for them
chuck clarks tackling has been weak af lately like dude just bumping them doesnt cut it in the nfl
hope yannick can comeback soon
punt return for the bills 213 buffalo

when i make crab cakes i never add a dash of lee and peerines
marlos coverage there oooof
this is potentially the worst o line in the nfl and we cant get to the qb oof
hayden hurst with the touchdown
161 rushing yards in one half
is this the most lopsided 173 game ever
looks like we wont play buffalo that is welcome news i like our chances against everyone right now but coltstitanssteelers are all a notch below them
brian flores look like he just finished smoking a blunt
marlon and marcus out there with half effort
i feel sorry for the bengals getting injured this game
the way this man steps up in the pocket can bring a tear to my eye
looks like lamar is well aware about 1000
lol someone calling out holding
getting chris godwin this offseason would be huge
dobby got his sock and ran with it
the refs like lamar
took 3 dudes
is that 1k
dez was blocking hard for lamar
too fucking easy
x time

edit but that works too
feed dobby
god this offense is fun to watch when were clicking
alright ladies and gents this ravens team is about to go on the warpath this postseason im stoked
lamar needs 2 more yards for 1k
jk 27 baby
did jk break the rookie record
nfl record for rushing yards in a game is 426 lets break it
god i love dobbins its insane to me how long it took for him to get more snaps
free elf
last year they benched lamar for the final game and then they had the bye week and lamar look rusty as hell in the playoff game i hope they keep him in there
im so glad jk fell to us
its kinda sad sad to see aj green as a hollow shell if his former self
no

chuck clark
judon lmao
lol judon
get lamar to 1k then sit him
how big of a lead should we accumulate before we brigade the bengals lb who talked shit on twitter
i know we have ptsd from last playoff game but we should genuinely destroy the titans their defense is worse than even the browns
germaine pratt twitter
how do you know when fluker is in the game

were getting a penalty
yes
llama got 1k
1k
only 300 yards to 3k passing yards
lamar over 1000
mr 1000
kind of funny how the announcers didnt even say anything about lamars record lol
lj 1k
there we have it
germaine
lamar is the lebron of the nfl people dont want to admit it he does it all
lamar is the only qb ever with more than one 1k rushing szn
maybe germaine pratt was just kidding like legit may have just been trying to be funny lol
there is literally no reason to pass the ball at this point lmao
nice by colon castillo didnt get pushy didnt get a stupid flag just walked away and defused
lmao bengals defense is so tired of this
so have we just run the ball all game like this
lamar jackson become first qb in nfl history to rush for two 1000yard seasons with that 7yard scramble for a first down jamisonhensley
hollywoooood the hay is in the barn
more like an hour away with all these commercials
3 td passes
he makes great catches he just needs to lock in 100 percent of the time and he will be just fine hes still having a quitely good year i think
hollywood needs to buy lamar a steak dinner his numbers feel higher than his actual performance this year
i am feeling hopeful for the playoffs in this chilis tonight
did lamar get the rushing yards record
lamars field vision man its as elite as his athleticism
random thought what ever happened to marlon brown
browns and steelers game is close they might even lose
if that was earl thomas he would have let him go
bullshit thats opi if anything
theres the pi call we are due soft call tbh
nfl trying to cover the spread lol
hahahaha peters said fuck you refs
wheres he going
wowwwwww lmao
mp juice man
brandon allen is so garbage lmao
lmaoooo mp juiceman
lmao bengals gonna bungle
man that was a td if his momentum wasnt taking him out of bounds he was going 100
mp juiceman
peters
did he step out at the 1 lol
ball dont lie
honestly if green was hungry he could ave changed course and beat peters out for that td
strange i havent heard the name germaine pratt from the announcers at all this game huh
brandon allen gonna go from reading defenses to reading tire pressures at goodyear
the hunt is on
you could say were in the hunt
wr hollywood brown now has 8 tds and 769 receiving yards this year i know hes had some struggles this year but hes hot at the right time and the ravens will be counting on him to hit some big plays in the playoffs gdowning14
im truly speechless
dobbins oh my lord
germaine pratt owned bahahahahahhaa
jesus pull everyone no more save it for the playoffs
ravens win

bengals lose
easy money
hey prattdo something buddy fucking clown
we want 400

we want 400
damn it well never know what he said after listen to me though
dobbins is the best rb in the league dont me
over 350 yards on the ground and we aint in the 4th quarter whats the record for a team in a game
quick go back to the tweet before he deletes it
let this be a lesson kids not to talk shit on twitter before you actually play the game
thats how you score as a rb big fuck you to the bungles
we honestly couldve treated this week like a bye hahaha
350 yards rushing in 3 qtrs
dobbins rookie card stock going up
i love that were fucking dominating still want aj green to finish his bengals career with a td in garbage time
more
so uh whats the all time rushing record again
some say dobbins is still running
lets sign germaine pratt in the offseason and use him as a punching bag
damn queen
the record for yard rushing in a game is 423
bowser wants his pick
the record for the most rushing yards in a game is 423 yards

ravens have 350 with the entire 4th quarter left
browns just went up 249

get ready for the overload of browns back in the playoffs news
zach taylor tryna make it 385
zach taylor is such a cunt
that was great by 10 recognising the ball hit his teammates leg and to pick it up and get some yards
58 yards from the nfl record for rushing yards in a game
umm but even if they prevented it from going in we scooped it up and the play was called dead wouldnt they have to actually possess the ball not just touch it
brooo bengals making this game too long
ingram 2019 form
i want the record of 423
i love ingram getting his bag too
ingram getting the chew clock snaps on the field
ingram needed that layoff to get healed up for real he has a decent burst now dude was moving like a rock a few weeks ago
i know im late but remember when everyone was saying kyler was on lamars level
feed me
510 138 in yards yikes
32
remember guys last year our rbs and andrews were injured going into the titans game i think we wreck their defense this year and will only need one or two stops on defense
the fuck was that
wtf was that lmao
get the ball back d
give us the record cowards
how many yards away are we from the record now
is it taunting if the defense refuses to play a down just to get the offense the ball
i know it doesnt matter but judon never gets holding calls
the most rushing yards by a team in nfl history is 423 by the giants in 1950 we have 398 i think we break it
what is going on with huntley looked so good last time he played
hayden hurst just got a td
damn can they let gus or dobbins back in real quick to do this for us
huntley is struggling
damn he looked good before why is huntley now incapable of running lol
huntley is good but hes definitely no lj
well trace is our backup i say
so long nopuntsunday
remember when huntley was the future backup and could be a starter for some teams
just let em score so we can get another crack at it
thats a pick forsure
wtf was that ref looking at
this should be a quick one
that is a clear fucking pick christ
i dont think we get the record were headed for kneel down territory
even if this doesnt stand clark has broke on the ball incredibly well today
that was a fucking pic
lmaoooo that ref looked annoyed to even be reviewing this
harbs wants the record too
thats a pick yall now about that rushing record
if we let our rbs to run it we will get it dont let huntley run that damn ball
gimme jk or gus for 3 carries and lets get this fuckin record
chuck you magnificent bastard we now have a good shot at the record
lets get 23 fucking yards on the ground
ingrams come on man

we have records to break
wtf no score in the fourth
funny how ingram is in to save talent
theyve given up im not surprised just slightly disappointed
damn oh well we still got 400 lmao
we aint gonna get it guys unless someone breaks off a big one
steelers in position to tie the game
lmao if the browns browns this up
duvernay jet sweet or something ingram for 0 yards is making me lose it
i havent posted in game thread yet lets fucking goooooooo boys big truzz
actually depressed we didnt get it lol
the forward pass was a mistake
2017 ravens proud rn
fuck the browns
they ran the table motherfuckersssss

whoop some titan ass next week
browns barely squeezed in theyll be one and done for sure
mason rudolf has such a punchable face
aww cute look at them celebrate down 100
ah yes a moment of silence for covid victims while having fans in the stands while its still going on
yall crazy for thinking we would ever lose this game with lamar jackson playing with flacco ok thats different but this aint the same ravens no more these are jacksons ravens
remember when we thought huntley was better than rg3 lol
who else rocking a white llama jersey lfg flockgang
i want lamar to houdini on their asses
please get up 3 scores early and destroy their hope
fuck i wish mekari was healthy he really has been so solid at c another undrafted success story
lets f gooo
for the love of god stop showing that shit
fuck you cbs
really cbs you start with that
love to see coloncastillo out there at center
bengals knees got ptsd
i love the magician
ricard is so beautiful
hey that play finally worked
i watch on sunday ticket so im always like 20 seconds behind and im addicted to refreshing this sub to see what happened

every game im like nah imma chill and watch it as is and i cant help it lmao
good to see ingram again
ah yes the ravens the only nfl team who ever commits a holding penalty
ugh i hate that play call there that play works after weve established something in the pass game
a draw on 3rd and 10 near the end zone very
cool roman
justice hill should not be on the field for 3rd downs
wasnt a bad play call actually the de just made a good play jackson may have gotten a first if he got past him
fluker leads the league in holding yayyyy
fucking steelers
ughh my cbs decided to show patriotsjets
tee higgins just pulled his hamstring running on that play
i hope hes not hurt as much as he seemed
prayers for higgins
that sucks man he was telling you could hear him
me can we get michael thomas mom no we have it at home michael thomas at home mike thomas
oh man thats rough lol
hope that guy is okay

like the penalty though
damn that sounded painful i hope hes okay
hoping for tee hes such a beast wr that looked so bad though
soulja
come the fuck on hollywood
would be nice if a soulja catches a pass that hits him in the hands
theres the dumb fucking waste of a roster spot soulja we know
were so low on db depth we got a dude wearin 17 lmfao
and we wonder why jackson had trust issues with wrs
i mean you couldnt hand it off into his hands any better than that soulja
right on his chest
every time marquise drops a ball lets take a shot
hollywood better be in front of the jugs machine every fucking day in the offseason
boykin
boykin been winning me back recently
thats how you catch it
just came by to say fuck hollywood you can be the quickest dude in the world but if you cant catch you cant catch boykins is better
miles boykin what a play ily
boykin take notes hollywood
dime
fucking perfect pass god damn
lamar to boykins great fucking pass
nice what a throw
if i had a dollar for every time i heard ricard was over 300 lbs
fucking dime pass
holy shit lamar dropping dimes
dimessssssssss
boykin he catch
i think the bengals are gonna find it hard to muster up the motivation for a comeback
im gonna be drinking some massive kool aid if jackson hits a few more deep today
gro mustve seen something on film lol all these deep routes today lets go
if boykin fought for every passing snap he would be a wr1 if he can learn to find holes in a zone he will improve dramatically
remember earlier in the year when everyone said boykin was garbo and now apparently hes our best receiver
what a dime
what a play lmao
lj looking good
analysts are always knocking lamar saying he cant pass if you actually watch the games he drops dimes and is just as good as a high end qb such as tannehill or deshaun dime down the sideline to brown that was dropped and that td pass is normal for him thing is he runs so well he doesnt have to do it all the time
you gotta feel like having dez on the roster is a positive influence on boykin he seems like hes really stepped up since dez got here
boykin has been doing so much better since we signed dez that definitely isnt a coincidence
averett is coming into his own
averett playing well
is wink wearing golfing gloves lol
where can i see that soulja drop pass wheres the replay
baker mayfield is in too many commercials

give bozeman a tackle on that one lol
that pass to brown was slightly behind but he still should of caught it
dads are dumb guys
gus girth god edwards

thanks spiro
love seeing castillo fill in instead of skura anyone with more knowledge know hows he been playing no errant snaps is all i need to know
we might get that 133 rushing by the half
two tips and one of them is a pick damn it
stared his receiver down good defensive play
thats on coloncastillo gotta engage there keep those hands down
wowbengals d is asking to be spanked now showboating down 10
that hunt guy is scary
bro allen is so fucking ass
great coverage by board
is it just me or is the camera work super sloppy today
all these negative posts about a batted ball pick if i went and read comments after the td would you all have made positive comments
thank god we didnt get burned by that
we need to get another lj deep shot
bengals defense celebration was short lived
was that a hollywood stiff arm
is it really a ravens game without a dumb offensive penalty
oh you thought you had the llama
amazing how much better the oline has been with all these injuries
u cannot mob with the dobb bengals
dobbins and lamar next year with a healthy stanley are gonna be insane
my god just run them over
and there it is
why do we get so much illegal formations do we not know the rules
there it is 32 snaps in
lol and there it is
illegal formation drink
what do they even say in the o meeting groups at this point pls stop
i really have to get my dvr working so i can figure out how we just got an illegal formation on a guard
no way we didnt break the record for the most illegal formation penalties in a season
theres our obligatory illegal formation per game
none of that in the post season plz
lamar set your feet dog
go for it
i feel like lamar has a perfect passer rating on 4th down
bengals players getting injured just to not play in this game anymore
gotta love
lamar
reminder cincy o has been playing much improved the last 4 weeks the defensive effort so far is noteworthy
steelers fg 103 browns
there is a lot of purple in the crowd
souljaa
soulja with the redemption
still time for another drive
nice seeing brown lay out for it
great to see hollywood swim over that coverage and immediately be looking for that
gus edwards has already converted four thirdandshort situations today easy money ravens baltimoreluke
cincys first girth down
lmao their first first down
is the defense tired theyve been on the field for like a total of two minutes this game lol
the dolphins would be putting fitzpatrick in right now if they could
queen almost never goes backwards when he makes contact absolute tank
wow dumbest short yardage call ever
weak sauce
glad we held em to a fg but also why are they kicking a fg
wink is taking that fg personally
the winner of that wild card game should get slimed
hell of a play by humph on that 3rd down right where they wanted to go
good half really impressed with lamars passing lately
another 172 yards rushing in the 2nd half and its 3000 for the year
lmfao super wild card weekend is on nick nfl reaching
nothing but positive things to say about the first half
would you rather play the steelers or titans personally id rather play the titans for revenge
miami getting smoked jesus
dolphins choking so hard

so much for your magic against the raiders
peters ripped off his towel like its flag football lmao
green and allen werent on the same page they werent even in the same book
averett being active i like it
bengals dropping like flies
clearly peters was just pretending to be beat there
damn bengals getting smacked by injuries today
our top 4 corners might be the best group in the league honestly who comes close to humphrey peters averett and smith
looking like well play the titans or colts
oh we trying for that record
third procedural penalty in an empty quiet stadium makes sense
dobbins dont go down
its everybody on offense want their own flag lmao
lamar clearly wants 1000
dobbins is already my favourite nfl player
i want to see ricard get the ball lol
ohio state running backs are the best
less than 30 yards to 1000
2 yards away lol
king of ohio
dobbins is so fucking good
2 more yards lets go lamar
i was kinda not thrilled with dobbins as a pick 2nd for an rb seemed high but i think hes a star in the making
running right thru these mfs
i love dobbins
really glad we could snag dobbins
jk27
this dobbins guy i see some flashes he might be good in the futurehard to say just yetmaybe
that ohio state celebration tho
was that 5 run plays for 70 yards in less than 3 minutes
dobbins reminds me of chubb power speed and agility are just off the charts
jk is a beast starter for years to come
our bye week will be the 4th quarter
the jets are winning again
jets beating pats with perriman as the top receiver
lmao at anyone who was worried about this game
idc who we play were a buzzsaw right now
has anyone ever actually died out therecause yall are gonna get me fucking killedim not going back out there

brandon allen micd up
so what are we thinking for next week
it would be hilarious if the bills blow their lead
in a very weird way i was hoping the game would be more competitive because itd let us see more lamar

but i realize this is insane and a blowout here is optimal lol
lamar got 1k
1000
he got it
talk about blink and youll miss it
1k lets gooooooo
germaine nope over for them pratt where you at
oh he knew

1000
is that 1000 0 reaction from announcers lol
he hit 1k pogg
the great 8 with 1000 rushing yards
edwards is a monster on these short yardage situations
hopefully we score 7 here and we can get huntley in
i want lamar to get an extra 1015 yards rushing just to make sure he doesnt somehow drop back under 1000 on a bad play
obviously i realize its because hes so important

but why do i cringe when i see lamar tackled but i can watch dobbins or edwards get rolled up and i feel like theyll be fine they are tanks
this rushing attack is brutal
more mooore
what a dart my god hes just on his shit right now so damn good
holly
looks like playoffs are on the menu
hollywoooooooooooood
brown has really stepped up hes fighting for yards thats what i like to see
soulja redemption
watch out nfl the ravens are back
its huntley time
holder is cracked
lamar better not play another snap
yall done dickriding him yet

call god
might be lamars nicest td throw this season
lets see huntley break ankles in the 4th
lamar jackson has just become the first quarterback in nfl history to rush for 1000 yards in multiple seasons hes also just the third ravens player to rush for 1000 yards in backtoback seasons joining jamal lewis 200204 and ray rice 200912 baltimoreluke
fuck 2017 btw lol
idk if weve just played bad defenses recently or if g roman figured something out finally but this offense is deadly atm
they keep saying first back to back about lamar getting 1000 rushing but vick only did it once ever and he was the only one to ever do it lamar is the first to ever do it twice at all
thanks marlon
ugh nice hustle by humphrey at least
yeah lets try to avoid this
score board
damn defense wants lamar to stay in apparently
he hooked averetts arm but thats alright lmao
wtf is that pi
the fact that stephen a smith copied word for word shannon sharpes take on lamar should tell you all you need to know about that clown
fuck the nfl and god bless mp juiceman
ok that makes up for it lers gooo
karma lets gooo
ball dont lie
bahaha leggo
lmaoooo juiceman
lol fuck you
instant karma lmfaooo
mp juice man
where do we get the ball now
take those pi penalties and shove it staright up your ass
i hope he didnt run that to the 1 yard line
round 1 of the excorism gauntlet is almost over
if he stayed in bounds he was gone
bengals are designed only to avoid shutouts
juiceman juiceman yeahdats me
he better not have gotten out of the endzone
lol mpjuiceman got a bone to pick
haha lamars donzo for the day and the regular season
its huntley season
i was so confused i was like

why does lamar look weird
huntley season
that was a pick 6 if he had been able to cut the turn a little more he had green field and gray skies ahead of him

and jfc dobbines holy fuck
not even the 4th q and huntley is in and lj already made a new rushing yards record
who do we send a thank you card to for the dobbins pick
dobby is a free elf
germaine you clown
dat boi fast fast
mf dobbins
dobbins is a fucking star
bengals thrown in the towel
dobbins is fucking incredible
stop they already dead
lets go for the rush record
dobbins is already a superstar
dobby my goodness
jk said ok chubb watch this
jk is a man the bengals are boys
i cant wait to see what dobbins top speed was on that bitch
i cant stop laughing at how bad the bengals are i seriously cant
dobbins helping me cover my parlay love seeing 27 ball
pratt getting stiff armed to let jk break loose makes it that much better hahaha
fuck it lets go for 500 rushing yards
lmao 383
400 rushing yards possible
its nice to see the team having fun again
lamar putting the mask over his eyes because the bengal offence isnt watchable
i aint gotta celebrate yall heard that haha
holy shit we have 350 yards rushing
playoffs baby
i dunno im starting to worry if well be making the playoffs s
listen to me tho
bye bye bengals
holy shit theyre gonna finish with 500 rushing yards lmao
got damn queen
man this feels so much like 2012
fuck it lets drop 50 on em and break records
bowser is having a great game
id love for this to be that much more of a statement game 50 to 3
the ravens have 350 rushing yards this is the most in ravens history for a single game
looks like its over for germaine pratt
im soooo happy we get a rematch in the playoffs against the titans we can get our revenge from last year
well hurtling towards the inevitable grudge match if players cant get fired up for round 3 against the titans than we simply dont have the dog in us titans have disrespected us in every possible way better be out for blood
watching these bengals definitely will have you wondering who dey
jesus christ taylor really is this necessary

at worst this will stand
wed destroy the all time record if lamar was still in the game its wild to think we still have a good chance of doing so with huntley

lets do it
weve got a shot at most rushing yards in a game in nfl history 423
is there any chance we play pitt with them losing and tenn winning later from what im gathering it looks like tenn is locked into the 4 seed but was wondering if there was any other scenario
two consecutive 3k rushing seasons nice job roman credit the man
huntley tua
lets go ingram
mark
what is the record guys
im lowkey pumped for next years preseason to watch huntley make some plays
were probably going to get browns vs steelers in the wildcard
top 3231 1430 ravens
man the bengals defense couldnt stop bama
30
come on ravens get the all time single game rushing record
were 30 yards from all time rush yards in a game
what the fuck was that call
i just want the opportunity to play the steelers in the playoffs they fucking suck and i have 100 confidence wed fuck them into the dirt
26
wtf happened there
after giving up 400 yards on the ground they need any small victory lol
cant nearly be upset this is a preseason game now
browns could still get clowned
fuckin a i so badly want the all time record for rushing yards inching closer
does anyone else put mustard on fried fish if its too salty
4 and 10 steelers convert for a td 2416 browns
bengals half time speech

boys lets get out there and get this over with
that was a hold on judon either way how did they not call that blatant pull back on his neck
fetch me their souls
we arent gonna get it
a punt by the ravens
ok so probably wont get the record but awesome game all around
tyler huntley ruining my vibe
well we may not get that single game rushing record after all

least we got the franchise record
these commentators are so boring
yeah trace looks like the better backup

however huntley is still a rookie so im excited for year 2 to see what he can do
pratt got a tackle today guys its over for us
did tucker just lay someone out
dolphins suck
just let them score so we can get the ball back with time for the record
why is vikes lions the game of the day out of nowhere
theyre running the ball so we dont get the record fuck the bengals
thats a pick
challenge that
how are we allowed to have a cb with number 17
got that
thats a pick

chuck got robbed smh
thats absolutely a pick wtf
clark got his pick
thats a pick
thats an int
rushing record back on the menu
thank you john
fuck it go for the challenge
pick
obviously 2 feet down with possession
chuck giving us one more chance i love you chuck
thats a pick
23 yards lets get it
we want that record no kneeling like a bitch
fuck off that was a pick
how far off the record are we why arent they talking about this
i wonder if they even know on the field about the record
chuck you gotta just shave your head man
aj green didnt even look back to act like he gave a fuck
such a graceful int
we not gettin it are we
the problem is it is three straight runs so cincy is ready for it i want that record
i love this team
bye bye record smh
21 yards

thats it
no record
rip the record
ehh i guess were probably not gonna get it lol
lets get to the outside running up the middle clearly aint working rn
i known mark has taken a step back but he gets bit behind the line way more than the other backs it seems
we aint gonna get the record with ingram running the ball
huge pass for the steelers 1st and goal with 230 left in the game
whelp we at least got over 400
eh we dont get the record but the important part is we won were in the playoffs and everyone came out healthy
lol ingram is struggling running vs 9 in the box and people call him washed like he is but not because of this game the ol isnt really trying plays are a pro bowl level in scheme complexity the bengals are really trying and everyone knows we are trying to run out the clock not the situation to judge a rb
these announcers are like two annoying people talking in a movie theater and not watching the movie
get a punt

run for 20 more yards

break that record
we got like 4 yards our last 2 possessions lol
you know who that rb was for cincinnati back in 2000

i dont know who

i dont know

come on man
browns really let mason drop 300 on them
ive never been more sad to rush for 400
how can i get both the steelers and browns to lose
fuck records lets worry about our first playoff match up
cut soulja ingram and rg3 and buy a wr1 and dont look back a wr1 boykin and snead is more than enough for lamar
refs love throwing flags during our game they know its their time to shine when we play
back to back plays of lamar missing open receivers lamar needs to stop being afraid to throw dumpoffs
fuck off with this ingram shit
crucial part about getting the 5 seed is that we have a good chance to avoid kc in round 2 either steelers or bills lose and we avoid kc til a potential afccg
please harbs please do not bench lamar right now
the fall off of aj green has been insane in his prime i used to argue with my friends he was just as good as julio looks dumb now but i honestly think he was at one point
lamar cant throw the ball
man ingram is so donehopefully he can get a 1 year cash grab somewhere next year
so no yannick today anyone notice who cant get to the qb now on the other side
looks like hollywood trapped that ball on the reception anyone else notice that on the replay

wish he could catch big passes with his hands
lamars off year is still a top 10 qb in the league


i honestly think if he was white he would be classified as elite by everyone no joke
this dude hollywood has had such an up and down season
the chad hollywood boykin vs the virgin bakersfield brown
say the line bart
37 seconds 3 tos easy points for lamar
if we pull lamar when hes two yards away
this is bullying
wink sets a sack record today

mark that shit
for baltimore and maryland we will fight on to victory
i think the defense is gonna feast this game

at least 3 tos
im chill i think we win this at a canter im more nervous about injuries
this is a game to put away early to avoid late game nervousness foot on the gas from the start
fuck they hit us with the boyd play before the game even started
why they gotta fuck us up at he beginning like that though
lets stomp them into the dirt
cmon boys
nice to see coloncastillo out there skura did not get the start
stop stop stop stop showing that
lamar got as many yards up field as he did side to side damn
just me or is there a sound boost on my tv everytime we snap the ball
lamar just made the bengals tackle each other at the line
duuuuuuvvv
ground and pound baby
glad we get replays this week
duv
that bell guy showboating after lamar overthrew it
not a fan of that guess we get 3
designed run on third and ten what is this the flacco era
option on 3rd and 10 come on
they have coloncastillo at center
stop running a qb draw on 3rd down
dumb play
heres the key that announcer needs to stop and take a breath
good hold townsend
ingram got out of the backfield

this is not a drill
so far so good from the new wolf pup in the pack
if he doesnt get hurt thats 6

edit well i didnt see the opi call at first
thats why we switched from turf
thank god thats coming back
yikes not a good call by the bengals to play your young stud wr in a meaningless game when hes been limited in practice with a hamstring
hearing him yell in pain like that was awful
that block in the back was completely unnecessary so undisciplined
what a throw what a drop
you have to catch that
gus blocked the mess outta pratt
wow i thought that was gonna be overthrown

did that hit him in the chest
disappointed but not surprised with that drop
youve simply got to catch that
we need more soljas

naw fam we need more hand eye coordination fuck
souljas stolen valor
ugh that hit marquise in the fucking hands
soulja a mf clown
really hoping brown has a turnaround like adams in a few years
tough catch but a number 1 wr catches that
dammit marquise how much better of a ball do you fucking need
yeah thats why you invest more in wr zrebiec
you cant throw it better than that gotta catch that one
yes yes lamar needs no wrs
catch the fucking ball you whiney bitch
lol when fans say lamar doesnt need a 1 receiver
fuck it lets get lamar the 1k yards rushing en route to a win
gus behind ricard is pure money on 3rd and short
boykin
did marquise perriman brown have this same problem catching in college

i just dont get why hes so trash at catching now
what a beautiful throw
boykin did a thing
boykin seems to be making the turnaround
boykin in the second half of the season has been so reliable starting to love the guy
boykin runs like my mom
x200b

lamar jackson
goodbye to soulja boykin is my new bff
touchdown ravens
fing beautiful
holy fuck lamar is dialed in on long bombs look the fuck out
everything about that play was perfect
what a dime
thats how you catch a damn ball
that was a good route from boykin
boykin lets goo
boykinnnnn
thank god boykin can catch
big boykin
hell yeah boykin lfg
boykin has been the real solja
its no coincidence that boykin started to show up more after we signed dez
stuntin on em
brown always tries to catch it with his body i dont know how his coaches dont correct this
looks like the game plan is to pick them apart deep and lamar has had two dimes so far hollywood is gonna get one here soon im sure of it
what a great special teams tackle
back to back 69 yard drives say less
hollywood needs to double up on his off season work outs i was stoked seeing him on instagram all off season thought he was gonna break out what a disappointing second season from him
weak dpi incoming

edit super glad to be wrong thought that red would be looking in the play area and not calling a presnap
im at the point where if i see 15 i get nervous
wait the ravens arent the only team that illegally shifts
averette has been playing good the last few games good to see marlos boy developing
ok that baker ad was decent
yo whats that for made me burst out laughing lol
flo baker
gus bus gurthy boi
bengals ran 6 plays in that quarter nice
ooh yeah tell me about gus girth
these announcers really love the word probe
good heavens that time of possession
already 94 yards rushing after the first quarter jesus
holy hell mason rudolph sucks
really want us to break the record for consecutive games with 100 yards rushing as a team

with how much the league has changed itll be practically unbreakable if were able to get it
has colon castillo been at c the whole game
why do we start fluker and than yank him every week can anyone tell me lol
we put that dude at rt and everything goes to shit idk why we do that
damn might need some deeper drops
okay defense your turn we have been light on turnovers lately time to get right
bro lamar just not looking at the left side of the field
lamar should ran there but i dont mind seeing him minimizing hits against the bengals we cant beat them with lamar playing safer we dont deserve playoffs
the ravens have now rushed for the 2ndmost yards in a single season in franchise history second to last year ryanmink
that was almost a dime damn good coverage
i love drives that start deep in our own territory against bad teams
bengals sub is unbelievably salty didnt know they hated us this much
time to run out the half and score a td a la 2019
uh oh gio you just got boarded up
damn bengals offense looks like a jv team out there lmao
small play but i like seeing hollywood fight for more yards
he didnt avoid contact
hes gonna get 1000 again isnt he
beautiful throw andrews should hold on to that
jacksons receivers are letting him down today again
lmao jackson didnt even get close to full speed on that scramble lol
my mans be stunting on dem hoes

baskin dobbins got 27 flavors
dobbins has been open 3 times now for a short throw to the left with no one around and lamar has decided to not throw it everytime

twice were last drive both on the tipped balls back to back and of course one led to an interception because he is forcing it instead of taking the free yards i hope someone is noticing that and pointing it out to him
speed kills
seeing a small running back in 27 run like that gives me flashbacks
i love our rbs
gus edwards and converting on third down name a more iconic duo
real talk whos our rb2 next year if another team swoops in and nabs gus jk is the obvious 1 but do you keep ingram or try to find another young guy is justice hill in the conversation at all
hahahaha ingram is always good for 1
extend the warranty on the bus already
there it is
oh i dont like the way 23 is writhing there
i hope the bengal is okay
ahh theres that procedural penalty we were missing
well there it is
ingram hit that 30 wall like a truck
illegal formation
theres the once a game illegal formation penalty
like mother fucking clockwork
death taxes illegal offensive formation
should we just start to put illegal formation on t shirts and own it at this point
go for it
go for it
punch it in with edwards
guss mouthpiece is tuffff
this mason rudolph guy is not very good at football
touchdown nice throw
nice route by hollywood brown
woah
soulja
90 yard drive goddam

nice route hollywood
man i wanted to be 6th seed and play the steelers
that hollywood td catch was harder than the one he dropped
if the dolphins lose today are they out of the playoffs
i love how that play action fooled the camera man
ravens making bengals fight and claw for every yard rn
no points please
d lemme just sleep for a drive
can we please not give up easy pointscome on you had like 3 hours of rest
i personally think were a killer d before being a true contender our offense is already competent enough but what happens when our offense stalls and our d cant stop shit

weve seen it time and time again and it will continue to be the case till we can stop the run set the edge and force good qbs to throw into coverage otherwise its a good secondary getting beat when tired
you just made wink angry
weak coaching sad
oh boy the phins are shitting the bed
halftime tony gonzalez hot takes in 321
brown only beating steelers practice squad by 4
is it just me or does it sound like spero dedes has been doing a mediocre alan alda impression for most of the first half
i dont know why i think the titans might face an upset
im likely dreaming lol
my only concern here is we saw nothing from the bengals offense to adjust to at halftime but the bengals saw like 40 plays from our offense we cant come out and allow another drive like that last one
pick time
if his arms were longer thats 6 points lol
averett pick the damn ball off lol glad hes playing good though
is our defense being soft as to not get injured i hope
green had peters too if allen pushes that further
averett is a good player
germaine pratt be real quiet tho
averett was always pretty sticky in coverage he just had the ball skills and awareness of a donut
i dont want browns to play the steelers next week man
thats the first time ive ever heard the name coloncastillo
i like when that happens
couple more like that
hes almost there fuck yessss i want it
dobbins is good
id lie down if i saw fluker running at me too bynes lol
dobbins is the real fucking deal
lamar
three great runs in a row
omgggggg lamar needs two rushing yards for 1000
this feels good guys
beautiful


stomp them out
lets gooooooooooooooo
jk dobbins
dobbins gets a touchdown dobbins is free
were gonna get huntley
so this wild card game on nickeverytime a penalty is earned do the offenders get slimed
gonna miss some of the player audio when theres fans in the stands again
amazing play by chuck clark there
4th and twelve im scared
did someone in the booth just step on a possum
was gonna day thats grounding
how many more yards for the 1k llama
i say at 28 points ahead we start pulling people
jake from state farm and larry fitz gonna get be charges if they aint careful
can we all agree that cbs is crap
ingram
dj fluker out here tryna run routes
243 nope over for them
how close is he
got the record
lj 1k
1k baby
holy shit that speed
thats the record baby
any time lj runs in cincy ive got he is houdini playing in my head haha
so if we win we get the tennindy winner
gus and dobbins is such a two headed monster that no one talks about besides ravens fans

fg for browns opponents 109 now hold on to your butts
bengals defense must be exhausted
all aboard
the three headed dragon lamar jk and gus
alright fuck it black or white lamar jersey
souljas fighting for yards
fuck germaine pratt
moar
so do the browns get in if they lose dolphins lose and colts win
good shit he made up for the drop
thats our mvp
i feel bad that this is aj greens last game
touchdown
i can relax a little now
rest lamar
okay backup time
woooow that was a nice
lets go
that was a dart
i believe its huntley season ladies and gentlemen
aye pratt missed the ball lmao
i wanna get that huntley v finley action
damn really nice play
truzz

time to put huntley on
l freaky
lets get huntley 100 rushing yards and a td of his own
can someone help me my table just ran
ok just because you can let a play like that doesnt mean your should
the defense needs to keep its head in the game
almost got it out damn
damn humph almost got the fumble there
marlo with his dk impression there lmao great chase down
these safeties are some liabilities against even a modestly competent passing game
pass interference my asshole
thats bs
lmfaooo
redemption
ridiculous pi call
are we through with a win
juiceman mp
revenge there f the ref
bullshit call aj was fighting and they both were looking for the ball
peters

lmao what a fucking throw
ball dont lie
lol what an atrocious throw
mpjuiceman
there it is
holy fuck
huntley
holy shit allen is not a good qb like at all not even practice squad worthy
wtf was that throw lmao
that made me moist
lmaoooo get wrecked
hahahahahahaha
ball dont lie fuck those pi calls
mp juiceman you get what you fucking deserve
it feels like it had been forever since we got an interception
peters is a dog
oh boy the post game marlo ig interviews on the bus are about to be fun
i hope he didnt just run out at the 1
thats quite the arm span by marcus lol jesus
l freaky t freaky
holy fuck dobbins
huntley making plays too i love it
gahahahahahahaha pratt got stiff armed to the next realm by jk
lmaooo fuck pratt
ayeeee they gave us the touch back
dddoobbbbinnnnssssss
ded
the dobbinator with the dagger 77 yard td
dobby
fucking monster
this is actually bullying now jeez
dobbins is a superstar baby
dobbins is a grown ass man
lmao lamar and jk dancing on the sidelines
jk dobbins is his name
bruh this is going to be a 50burger at this rate

edit yo the alltime game record might legit be in reach if the defense keeps getting stops
damn have we punted at all lmao
he is fucking fast
i fucking love dobbins
stunt on them hoes
d o b b y
i almost feel bad for cincy
wholly shit
oh my lord jk
what the fuck
bitch ass nigga pratt
pay that man his money
dobbins to the fucking house
this game is perfect for burning 57 after talking shit
350 rushing yards lmfao
pratt gonna have to delete his twitter
thats future top 5 running back dobbins to you
pratt made the highlight reel
dobby
jk dobbins is eliteeeee
dobbins is gonna be a stud
as has been previously said jk all day
dobbins needs feed in the playoffs
we might end with 3000 rushing yards on the season
id pay to hear what everyone is saying on the field all the time
massacre
dobbins pissed that some dude on the bengals ran for 55 and got the longest play of the game so he gets that 72 yarder
so who was the bungals player that was talking shit
how the fuck do the refs miss rudolph getting clocked in the head
happy birthday lj fort we got you the playoffs
people actually thought the bengals had a chance today
tyus what a play
we want colts or titans
well need the bengals to punt if we want to get the single game rushing record 423 otherwise the field just isnt big enough
the coach is throwing the kicker a bone to give him the longest punt of the year without the touchback bragging rights i guess
this rush offense feels better than last year right now
if we keep running the ball we have a chance to break the all time team rush record in a game giants rushed for 423 yards against the baltimore colts in 1950 were 73 yards short with a quarter to play
no dont pass
huntley brett farve
getting closer to that record
we setting it go for it
25
bruh moment
were like 35 yards from the record or sum
we will get the ball back dont worry
go for it harbs
go for it
shouldve challenged it we wouldve lost it but the lulz wouldve been worth it
fake pa qb draw
he aint lamar
modified farve huntley
wtf was that lol
need 3 more yards
im sorry but im not going to a restaurant and ordering lunch meat
40 more rushing yards and we have nfl record
let the bengals get a td so we can just grind out that all time rush record
830 to get 26 more yards cmon guys
lets get this record boys
26 yards with only our backups in lol the bus and dobbins aint coming back
give me the record
green is so done with that team and id be lying if i said it didnt make me happy
remember in the last quarter of the browns game when it looked like we were going to miss the playoffs
tyler boyd is dreaming of the off season
huntley looking the wrong way for that handoff oof
side note but hurst is balling out in the atlanta game
we need trace back lol
if we dont break the fucking record
cmon tyrod jr be decisive
that was ugly
im gonna be so pissed if harbaugh doesnt take this chance to break the record
let the bengals score so we get the ball back quicker i need that record
huntley looks like a peewee rb out there running into his own guys and generally running around aimlessly
let the bengals in so we can try for the record
how many more rushing yards do we need
lmao tua sucks
challenge it thats a pick
how is that not an interception
lets fucking go we have a shot
thats a pick lol
announcers have been taking it up but john really is a great coach
challenge it
int
poor chuck
lol challenge flag up 383 to get the ball back
lol this team beat the steelers two weeks ago
fuck that was an int
thats a pick lets get the record
harbs with the challenge sending a message to the bungles head coach
he caught that
chuck it
why would they rule it incomplete if they didnt know whereas they review turnovers anyway
thats a pick
fuck the refs looking at
clear as day
how tf did they call that incomplete
time to make clark a receiver what a catch
that put of bounds step looks awkward doesnt it
nice to have a confidence boosting game before playoffs
lets get 10 rushing yards
i have a feeling if we dont get it in the first few 23 carries john is just gonna kneel it out lol
is dez playing todaygetting on the field ive got a bet riding on whether or not he is and havent been able to stay tuned in
how many yards do we need
would be funny if clark gets a bonus for every int and he gets like 25k because of that lol
nope fellas we fell short
kinda wish they kept jackson in a little longer so they could get the record
browns are shitting the bed
throw up the x for clinching
justice hill put him in we need the record
try again next week tennessees defense is doo doo
feeling like jamal lewis going for the season rushing record vibes
steelers td going for 2
espresso depresso for the record
happy festivus flock
the bois did it
suggs catch
hey mods can you rename thread steelers v browns game thread
took the browns long enough
leave hill on the fucking sideline holy fuck
johnny townsends number 6

justin tuckers number 9
this team needs to stop blitzing the house playoff teams will get it out fast and burn us every single time our d is so predictable
looks like play action is back on the menu boys
the next gen stats ads are so corny
that interception was not very cash money
remind me why josh bynes would pick the bengals over us lol
queen just puts his head down and hopes for the best
dobbins will be a top 3 back next year ill die on that hill right now
not the call lol
we have a million dollar opportunity and i feel like were just not gonna take it
yall gotta remember ingram had covid it probably hit him harder considering hes older could be why hes looked so ancient for the last month and a half
we had two drives to do it couldnt do it sad boy hours to the left
that was a stupid fucking playcall
daily reminder that our offense would be practically unstoppable if we had drafted dk or aj brown instead of hollywood
a nigga that dont drop passes
this fucker should switch to volleyball
3 tds in the fourth or 4 tds late third

oops this was meant to be a response to someone asking when we sit people
bro that scream tho rip headphone users
haha how did the shitty steelers lose to this team
i dont want to face the titans
im honestly speechless from that call
looks like we have ray rice back if he didnt beat his wife
is ingram active today
tcc or skura starting
didnt see sam koch on the inactive list is he able to play today
love the white on purple
lets fucking gooooooooo
i know its a good cause and all but could they not have jo in a counterfeit jersey lol
would love a 200 lead at half
god damn 2017
moore instead of duv
here we go llamatime
lfgggggggg
hopefully colon does well so that we have a good backup to mekari
hopefully aj green wont come back from the dead to haunt us like he has in the past
why do i miss josh bynes
gus hair is getting longggg
lamar just ran 100 yards to get 14 yards lol
dobbins hit a nice downfield block there blocking is the part of his game im most interested in seeing

i know dobbins and edwards our guys now but i like seeing ingram get a good carry there
zeus jr got that pull block off perfectly to save lamar great shit from him
lamar wanted to just zap em all there
he is houdini
hoping that rest can make ingram at least somewhat as good as he was last year
big truzz sighting
i really did not think dobbins was that fast or quick coming out of osu
duuuuuuuuv
i hate spero dedes
literally just watched the last bengals game where dev broke off 40 yards on a run
need to get the ball to duv more often
yup thats the last time well see dd outside of kick returns today
why the fuck are we doing a draw on 3rd and 10
going back to that qb keep well too often its almost guaranteed that will be run on 3rd downs like 3 times a game
we can run all day on the outside wish we would go to that more
its alright guys lamar had to beat one guy in the backfield he usually does
im a big critic of roman but did yall watch the video that kollman put out he explains a lot and you guys should watch it
what kind of a defensive play call was that
the bengals are always incredible at getting people wide open against us
oh boy we dodged a bullet there hope dude is ok
hope he alright
underneath routes when will we fucking learn
all around shitshow on that play for both teams
damn they committed a penalty and the man hurt his hamstring
poor dude
man i hate that for tee that flag is just some salt in the wound too
man fuck injuries
daaaamn chuck
going down without being touched is never a good sign hopefully he just pulled something
just going down like that with no contact is real bad news hope hes okay
if you can see the dudes fucking name dont hit him jesus christ
good play blows out hamstring opi pretty unlucky
that was obviously going to be a flag he shouldnt have even bothered
special teams discipline is terrible this year harbs has to be beside himself
dumbass
i feel like theres an illegal block in the back called on about one in three kick or punt returns when the receiver actually runs
blocking in the back us the dumbest play
if we lose this game itll be because we keep getting stupid ass penalties
fucking hollywood wtf that was underthrown but jesus
soulja wtf
yeah im fucking over this guy man
thats got to be a catch come on
i hate hollywood again
soulja
jfc hollywood
gus with a monster block
cmon hollywood
im tired of him
dammnit lil soulja cant haul it in
hollywood come on
how do you drop that wtf
dude
brown you worthless fuck
gus strong af
soulja
dude brown
gus bus wearing that wide load stay clear sign on that block
fucking trash again from soulja
get me a mother fucking wr1 please
jfc you have to catch a dime like that
imagine if we had a wr that could get open and catch
first game with my new ricard jersey
no holes there for dobby unlucky
brown showing some hands
get you a girl that blocks for you like gus edwards blocks for his qb
oh hi marq
allenrobinson plz get him
or pass it
boykin
beautiful pass
boykin is our wide receiver 1 change my mind
jackson dropping dime
money
thats mah boykin
69 yards nice
see hollywood thats how you do it
beautiful throw
boykin baby
boykin is slowly turning into an actual asset on the field
is boykin a better soulja
big dick boykin
bold prediction boykin will have a pro bowl year next year
great route good route combination perfect throw love to see it
oh fuck mike evans is hurt again damn that dude is unlucky
i really want to like hollywood but the dude straight up just cannot catch anything

jackson taking a chance

a fking slap in the face to his abilities
back to back good plays by averett loving it
now that was a bad bounce
lol the bengals crying to refs is just funny to hear
lol looks like the refs were arguing
i love watching pratt so far today look like an absolute stooge
holy shit that replay lmao wtf
girthy gus
152 yards to 4
that was a good quarter of football boys
why every time we play the bengals the announcers gotta make some clown comments
fuck
fuck
should we target kyle pitts i the draft get back to that 3 te set
dammit
he had the rb in the flat never looked
lmao 4 total yards of offense in the first quarter


bengals kick one of the pussiest fgs of all time

wink martindale and i took that personally
why do we keep starting fluker to bench him with phillips every game
run the ball there lamar
sloppy throws two times in a row
in a row goddamn
other guys open too
that was unlucky
awesome lb coverage
nice grab but not even close to in bounds
ive already seen too many designed runs for lj really hope they dial that back
fuck passing in the middle lamar
bills just took the lead against miami 73 browns driving against pittsburgh 1st goal inside the 5
browns held to a fg 100
and we immediately lose the gain on 1st down great
niceeee
jackson keeps second guessing and i hate it
lamar just teleports man lmao this shit never gets old
can we hold onto the damn ball
watching this game as a bengals fan must be so frustrating lol
would be nice if we could make one tough catch for lamar
run the ball thats it
he is so fucking fast
imagine playing perfect defense on 3rd down and lamar just lifts his middle finger and scoots for a first down
andrews is quickly becoming butterfingers he routinely drops key passes if he wants to be in the same league as kittle and kelce he has to catch these clutch plays
that boy fast
why must we drop the ball
if i were to sum up what i love about our run game lately

gus has looked more elusive than i would expect and dobbins has looked more powerful than i would expect
dobbins plays really fucking good in ohio
pratt feeling dangerous today
as predicted with ingram
ground and pound man
gonna end up with 350 yards rushing today
the gus bus doesnt have breaks
mark ingram
aaaaand mark ingram only gets a yard lmao
there it is
forgot bynes was on the bungles
i honestly feel like i can go take a break every time gus is in on short yardage just automatic
fucking illegal formation
at least we got it outta the way
illegal formation everyone drink
due one of those
is anyone keeping track of illegal formationmotion penalties per game for us i feel like we might be breaking a record here
these illegal formations are ridiculous how is it that every game we have this penalty i seriously dont understand
man i cant wait until my toddler goes down for a nap and i can have a beer and enjoy the rest of this rout
these type of plays cant happen next week if we win today
go for it
go for it
what a fucking liability
that was a dart
fucking brown man
i love lamar
soulja didnt drop it again
how nice of the bengal player to shove gus to the first down
gonna need some ketchup we eatin so much clock
i feel like we should take some shots on 2nd and 1
i think i might be just a little disappointed if we dont go up 17 here
beast
soulja
if this gets to what score do you start pulling people or is that out of the question
this is a trap game alright a thirst trap game im horny as shit
who are we facing in the playoffs steelers or browns
if we get our first playoff game against the steelers omfg idc if we lose the next round itll be so glorious
damn this is not the drive we needed right now
looks like the dolphins will miss the playoffs which means kevin stefanski will likely win coach of the year
would like to see us overload one side of the line and blitz
so if the dolphins lose and we win titans win wed play them correct conversely if the colts won and titans lost wed play the colts correct
pussy shit
deepshot
soft as baby shit lol
bills pounding on the dolphinsmakes it more likely we draw tennessee than pittsburgh
well i slept through the first half what happened
whos yalls preferred playoff opponent
i wanted the steelers and didnt want the bills titanscolts are cool though hoping we play sunday too
so did lamar get exactly half the amount of rushing yards he needed for 1k in the first half lol
so who do the browns play assuming they win bills or back to back steelers games seesh man thats tough for cleveland
is there a scenario where the dolphins dont make playoffs mia loss and ind win

edit damn so many responses so quickly where the fuk are you guys when i have to write a research paper
well if we do win and then play the titans weve literally built this defense to stop henry when healthy so well see
i feel kind of bad for dolphins they are getting violated
whoever coaches the defense up tackling wise needs to go its been such shit this year
lets get a sack come on
if we finish this game off with a win then our opponents in order of likelihood tennessee colts pittsburgh and buffalo a very likely seed order would be chiefs buffalo steelers titans ravens browns and colts wc matchups would be colts at bills browns at steelers and ravens at titans in that scenario i see it being more than likely the browns beat the steelers which would prevent us from seeing the chiefs until at least the afc championship
do not let that man make catches
second half defence in bound boys
lucky peters got beat there
is yalls picture jerky im watching on sunday ticket and its driving me nuts
peters got beat thank god that guy didnt throw further
at first i though averett shoulda picked that but on the replay it was good he just broke it up hes coming on strong
what the hell happened to aj green he used to be a top 10 wr and tear us up every game and i havent heard of him in so long
run out the clock boys
i was never convinced the dolphins were that good
bigger wasted talent on a shitty team aj green bengals or andre johnson texans
do we want any specific scenario to play out in the other games that could help us out i know win and were in but beyond that
we still need more corner depth and should probably target one in the mid rounds of the upcoming draft but the way averett is developing is encouraging
22 yards
yeah bozemani see you
dont stand on the tracks when the d train is coming through
i fucking love dobbins
lj want that guap lol
wow that was an incredibly deceptive pull
good god that was two great runs in a row
oh he want that 1k
fuck yesss
easy
he is so damn good
what a player dobbins is
dobbins too easy
lamar is 2 yards away watch him not run for the rest of the game
big boys mauling on that drive
jk finishes
dobbins throwin up the o for his fans
how many more does lamar need to get to 1000
imagine complaining about the refs when you have like 5 yards of offense and cant convert on 3rd down keep the foot on the gas boys
how does jks rookie season compare to swift j taylor and ceh
they didnt even make a tackle on that last drive lmao
lamar is what like 15 yards away from another 1000yard rushing season
whose idea was it to have nick on a playoff game anyway lmao
not in my house
lets goo
clark is really having a good game
g r o u n d i n g
do defenders get credited sacks for intentional grounding
nope over for them
for some reason i thought lamars vegas prop total for rushing yards was 9995 but it was actually lower and hes passed that

was thinking thatd be the worst bad beat ever if he finishes with 998 yards
ravens now need 97 yards prior to that run for 3000 rushing
jackson 1k
if the dolphins lose is there anyway the titans miss the playoffs
bozeman was ready to throw down
theyre declining penalty yards now in favor of fewer downs since we keep converting lol
that ref lingering butt touch tho
lj2ks
not bad for a running back
lfreaky gonna get that 1k
love that second effort by the bus
are nfl teams allowed to throw in the towel because these guys have given up
tyler incoming
hell ya brown
soulja
soulja with another one
has there ever been a team with three 100 yard rushers in the same game
basement brown lmao
hollywood
commentator really likes calling it the queen city lol
check the flair
promote hollywood to lt
huntley time bb
oh i cant wait for next week
huntley time bout to drop 30 more points
lets gooooo
i wasnt afraid guys i know you wont believe me but i wasnt afraid of this game i knew that things would work out and look at it its marvelous
if we make a stop here i think huntley will go in
32 is to blame for that play
elliot whiffed so freakin hard
ay bruh what the fuck
horrible play by elliott it was handoff all the way
its so cool seeing marlon getting ready for the knock out
ajahahahaha
juice man
lmao
hahahahah
marcusssss
ayyyyy lmao
thats a bad call on peters
juice man
lmaooooo
99 more rush yards incoming
hahahahahaahahahahahahaah
the juiceman
should have stayed in the end zone but that was clean
mpjuiceman
how would you feel if we could sign aj green for really cheap
angry mp smash hope
superstar
its huntley time
dobbins
oh my fuck that boy fast
hahahahahaha
hes goooone baby
holy shit
snoop time
td

theyre already dead
free elf
lol we broke the bengals

god damn
god hes fucking good go jk
did we just hit 3k rushing
get some nfl
no joke whats the single game rushing record cause we are over 350
oh my
my god man theyre already dead
godbins
holy shit
its only the 3rd quarter guys lol
we need to take dobbins out the game now too
i feel as if we may win this game
zac taylor thinking please fire me i dont want to play in this division anymore
koch not playing who cares we wont be punting
nice
love that the stiff arm was on pratt talk shit during the week and get fucking owned on gameday
just give ingram the rest of the carries this game and rest everyone else
jk slob on my dobbinnnnsssss
bengals deserve to lose by more for that weakass 4th 1 field goal
future league rushing leader
now the age old question do you take out lamar or let him stay hot
jk all dayn
steelers picked
have we punted yet
lmaoo
dobbins feels like what we were missing from our running backs explosion
boys we have a whole quarter we may legit break the single game rushing record
ravens 40 rushes 350 yards albertbreer
weve passed 3000 rushing yards right havent seen any mention of it yet
king koopa
when does the wc schedule usually come out after snf or sometime tomorrow
ravens player should have laid down with a foot in the endzone before touching the ball
i want it at the goal line so dobby can go for 99yards
dobbins destroying his former fans hearts
this might be even more dominant than any game we had last year
now stop wasting our damn time
the only thing this challenge does for the outcome of the game is give the networks more commercials for us
im hype fot huntley tbh yall he seems legit
gene staratore the goat
petty challenge by taylor who knows this is his last game as a coach
huntleys gotta have the qb2 slot locked in for 2021 hes the most lamarlike nonlamar we got plus we gotta keep him off someone elses roster
ingram running with a purpose
seeing miami getting decimated is soooooo sweet
34
lets goo
32 yards for the singlegame team record
yikes
huntleycmon bro wrong direction
26 yards needed for single game record
dolphins are looking almost as bad as the bengals
is anyone kinda bummed they have 3 points
nice catch tyler boyd buffalo bills legend
time to get that rushing record
brandon allen threw for 371 yards last wk

how
alright time to get that precious single game rushing yardage record
2 yard ingram
i want huntley to rip a long on for the record
24 more yards
whats the purpose of playing that
lmao was that ferguson in coverage wink strikes again
someone goes the wrong way and bozeman 5 yards behind the line on his butt isnt a great combo
field goal
doodoo
uh oh record looking like it may be just out of reach
instead of this comeback narrative why not mention how he has done it against multiple teams this year and the defense was the let down
wouldve been nice to have 0 punts without koch and a nice little stat
no record for us
lol mcsorely should be our 2
huntley finding out about nfl speed lol
how many yards do we still need for the record
oof huntley
miami is getting obliterated jfc
just hand the fucking ball off stop trying to keep it
23 yards to the single game team rushing record
buffalo up 4913 damn
i kinda want to face the titans let llamajax slay both dragons in one go first playoff win and theyve figured him out
whos 17 isnt even a real defensive player number
we need our d to do a reverse rudy situation gotta get the ball back for the o
thats a pick
thats an int
thats a pick
throw that flag
both feet in
that a pick our ball put lj out there and lets break the fucking record
uhhh thats a pick lol
wait who the hell is 17 brooks and why he on defense
28 yards away
now get that motherfucking record i wont be happy if we dont
we win by 38 at least
moar rushing
niceeeee lets get the record
yeah oh well well get it next year i guess
i get it that this is just garbage time and running the clock out but huntley could really show us some passes
just tossed the record aways feels shitty
feels good to be back in the playoffs lets just now get a win
ugh hurry up i want to see the browns choke to the steelers
playoffs here we come
plaayyoofffssss
lamar and the crew beating them so bad i kinda feel bad must be demoralizing its like in 20162018 where steph curry would bombarded a team with 3s theres just absolutely nothing you can do
does lamar look a step slow
souljas catch balls just sayin
15 is fucking trash
i just want hollywood to catch those man

he doesnt have to be a true 1 i want him to be but if he can just consistently catch those big plays ill be happy with the pick
coloncastillo needs to hit that guy in the ribs the dl knows he is going against a rookie
lamars arm slot was not the issue the ravens throw a ton of balls short over the middle tips happen just gotta live with it
lamar is leading hollywood up the field and hollywood says nah im good
andrews has that covid brain fog today
did andrews give up on that if he turns back a tiny bit thats a td
looking like well be 5th seed
not that it matters but lj is putting this game away to where he might only play 3rd quarter and not hit 1k rushing for the season the team only cares about the playoffs but it would be cool to see him get it
we lost the 2014 divisional when we led by 14 twice
tyus bowser really stepped it up this year in a contract year tho smh lol we gotta find a way to keep him
why are we still giving ingram courtesy carries lol
dr soulja mr scrub
thats one of the cleanest throws ive ever seen lamar make thats up there with the andrews throw against i think cle last year over the middle
if we play tennessee bring the whole team over to do a choreographed tiktok dance on the logo if we win
so glad to be back in the playoffs lets gooooo
mark ingram has been such a great teammate im gonna miss him
lets just say huntley went undrafted for a reason lmao
107 is an incredible record for the playoffs
god i love mark but he is so fucking bad now
i hate fucking roman
we cant beat tennessee then we cant win the super bowl the matchup will be whatever it is if we make the playoffs
our second half performance has been a concern this season hopefully we can stay dominant
congrats browns fans

we may not like them but this is a long time coming
good for the browns even if their fans suck they are better than the dolphins or steelers too
my ass is clenched
andy dalton will watch this game on television

take comfort in that
thats a conservative playcall that tells me we think we can win the war of attrition
yikes roman
if the browns and dolphins both win we play pittsburgh in the wild card thats the outcome i want
the boykin is woykin
hopefully we can get a big enough lead that we put in trace mcsorley later in the game id love to see him get some action
is their whole defense really celebrating like that while still down 100
there are times for the sidearm throw and then theres that
please bench ingram send him back to to new orleans
bro hollywood is scared of contact dude will be out of nfl in a few years
brown is the new perriman
still caught it with his chest im worried for his future guys
gutless handoff
meanwhile giants up 207 im rooting for the eagles tonight so we have a 610 division winner
andrews has been a non factor today
huntley time
im not afraid of the titans guyswe will right the ship against them
i want the browns to make the playoffs so they can lose in the first round its gonna be great
their coach is so douchey
the afc north is fuck cincinatti 3414 in playoff contenders wow
cant believe the bengals defense celebrated that hard after one good play small team mentality
hollywood shutting the haters up lmao
side chick is apparently a bengals fan im devastated
anyone know merkaris status
supposedly skuras bad snaps were due to a hand injury lets hope because i dont wanna see his wonky ass snaps today

side note one of lamars most underrated skills is fielding awful snaps like its nothing
when that whistle blows lets unleash hell today when that whistle blows lets unleash hell
hype levels at dangerous levels
it would be cool af if spiro dedes married a woman named mya
who tf is spero dedes
i never bet on our games because i am normally nervous enough as it is but i just put money on us at 135 i truly think we are a top 3 team in the league right now and will make a statement going into the playoffs lets win by 28
first time listening in from the radio on the ravens app lets see how this goes
overunder on our first illegal formation penalty is set at 18 offensive snaps what are you taking
sam koch out our best qb is out dam
can you believe this is the last game of the season feels like yesterday we started

damn
oh they gotta play that shit huh
i hate the fucking bengals
thanks cbs very cool
why tf is chris moore on the field
damn cant get it on the tv have to watch a stream fucking steelers browns game
lets fucking goooo
cbs knows that this is going to be a boring ass game without tension they need to try something
love when gus gets 45 yards on 1st just completely opens up the series of plays
lol llama
magic
loving this ground game start
duvernay is electric
i really do love duv
the misdirectionspeed combo is lethal
lets go
fluker is a walking flag lol
duuuuuuuuuuuv
get it to andrews
can we please throw to duvernay hes crazy fast but i want to see what he can do down the field
he had dez
wth was that roman
why was that a run
garbage play call there roman
fucking roman
just hold that ball for the
have we had one offensive drive this season that had a holding call and we actually scored a td i swear every offensive hold we get basically nukes the drive at that point
divisional games are always weird
that neighborhood show looks tragic
other games browns just scored 70
lamars footwork on that overthrow was awful his last couple weeks have been great mechanically something to watch for sure
gotta try throw for endzone there really nice drive though holding call took away the flow
we all knew that drive was done after the holding call
it will make the season for this loser team if they win this game i hope we crush them
lol steelers
how was that not opi
that play looked bad but if lamar beats that one guy hes big gone
wow thats fucking awful
hope higgins is okay that looked like it fucking hurt
thats a hamstring
i hope he is okay
opi legit lold
go man single high safety generate zero pressure lol
that looked awful
hope higgins is ok but boy that was laughable
i wanted tee higgins pretty bad in the draft even in the first round seeing that is rough i hope hes alright
oh man i kind of feel bad for the bengals there
holy shit that looks bad
im gonna townsend it

johnny townsend before that kick probably
hey they didnt let up a 3rd and long
right tackle went early but no harm no foul
fucking idiot block why
stupid hit chuck dont lead with your head
block in the back
dumervil is back as a punt returner
block in the back
weird seeing a db wearing 17
special teams hasnt been too hot with the penalties lately
stupid penalty there by brooks
such a bad block in the back lol
it was like a block with intertwined legs

cant take a penalty in that position field position too good even with no return
pratt a
goddamn that was blatant block in the black
youll get the next one soulja
brown is soooo disappointing
i stg
souljas gotta make catches
god dammit brown
ah cmon hollywood
oh dear
bro hollywood you gotta catch that

lamars fine people
lamar going for that 1k
lmao didnt 57 say their winning today hes giving awful effort out there
use ya souljas
llama jackson nice run
got to catch that 0 excuse
fuck that was a nice pass too
soulja sighting
i need to see a closer view from of that pass did it go right through browns hands
great block gus
was that a drop by brown or just unlucky with the timing
play brown in the slot lets just cut him
bet one of the rookies woulda caught thatput them in coach lol
dobbins cut on that turn 2 into 7
oh my soulja
resign gus
gus edwards is so a clutch on third down
those 3 backs
lamar put that on a platter for brownsmh
arob catches that golladay catches thatgallup catches that
boykin
hell of a pass by jackson
boykinnnn
das is mai boykin
dayum boykin is getting hot lately
lets fuckin go
boykin quietly producing lately hmm
oh boy that route was sex
boykin making plays
i thought that was dez lets go
boykin having better hands than brown
elite
bench brown message needs to be sent
miles
lets go td
boykin baby
my mvp
boykin is our best wr and im not sure its close
so sexy
lamarrrrrr
lets goooooo show em boykin
i want to see one of those deep shots to dez next drive
part of me wants lama to get 1k rushing yards but i definitely dont mind these deep pass plays
ill take 3 more of those please
i know we have short memory but hollywood was averaging 8090 yards earlier in the season i mean now hes a littleinconsistent now to say the least
great tackle by the teams
fort snagged that guy stopped a grown man from running and sent him back three yards
great play by averett
i want to fucking humiliate these guys 450 final score
good job averett
i wanna see dez throw that x up next drive
good play by averett
good play by averett again
lol wink got the wr gloves on
who has the livestream link
i know its easy to say this right now and marquise has the potential to make a huge play every game but boykin has better hands just a fact
i love gus edwards man
the girthinator
bozeman with the toss for another 4 yards lol
the commercial is so corny but i love fitz haha
i have spent my entire life waiting for a ravens team to at least try the basic nextlevel stuff that guys like rodgers and peyton always did like the end of quarter fakeout it didnt work but i just appreciate seeing it lol
fluker and skura benched already
we gotta run it there
jesus christ
oooof
well that was less than ideal

x200b

no more turnovers lamar
welp great
lamar had a wide open receiver there he needs to look elsewhere than just the middle of the field
why was he able to finish the tackle on lamar and not roughing
run the fucking ball man
shame someone was open
fuckkkk
what a defensive stand
boykin was wide open on those last two plays
bernard is a pros pro thank you for that mediocre pass
watch the fake here
at least the defense got them immediately right back off the field ah well time to pick up where we left off
good coverage from defense make the turnover useless
over under on the bengals breaking 10 yards of total offense before the half
both big mistakes end up not costing
lmao
is lj fort coming back next year
chris board is playing like hes trying to take queens job
defense doing great
cincinnati plays our offense really well
drink me
brown took a tiny bit of arm contact celebrate
zeus jr nooooo

bruh false start
i wanna see some outside zone runs theyre super stacking the box right now
how are they saying lamar missed holywood shit commentators
these passing concepts tho so often uninspired
he needs what 52 yards for 1000

edit hes at 42 currently

2nd edit 41
butterfingers everywhere
this ref has a constant look of disappointment on his face
waiting eagerly for someone to consistently come down with everything hitting them in the hands
dobbins was a better target than andrews there
bruh drops are killing us today
man mark my man gotta haul that in
dobby
i love seeing those plays from dobbins
we really can just run it a bit more esp on 1st down
drops drops drops get this out of your system
thats why we keep the vertical shots roman the running game feasts
there it is
nice patience there from gus
the bus running over rough terrain
hollywood was gone on that corner
we are over 100 yards as a team
hubbard got played there
hot damn edwards
gus is such a beast
giving ingram some snaps to knock off the rust
the dolphins offense is so damn bad
gus is such a tackle breaking son of a gun
lets see a pass to ingram
there it is
oof classic
god dammit
wrs always gets butter fingers around playoff time
lol man hard seeing us get stuffed on a run
why is ingram in
illegal formation everyone take a shot
wow what happened to that guy on the bengals that looked bad
maybe if that bear shaved his ass he would not need so much toilet paper
offense is a little off after the hot start
the illegal formation penalties are happening because of all the changes on the offensive line
jackson keeper coming up
edit guess gro figured hed used it too much already
lamar is a beast
hollywood
ok we looking goooodd
soulja
lets goo hollywood
soulja
hollywood you did something woo
thank god
hate to see it miscommunication should have been a touchdown
finally damn
there you go soulja
uuuuuuu
yesssssirrrrrskiiii
holy shit

brown didnt drop that
s o u l j a s
finally brown catches something
the ravens almost doubled the number of plays the bengals have run this game on that drive jesus
uh oh no no no
looking like well be in nashville for wild card weekend
tua is a rookie always going to be due for a bad game in this league
zac taylor is pathetic lol
is taylor kicking out of spite
they know they have a sorry ass team
coouple quick passes try for that fg lol
fg time
steelers fg 106 browns now
we got both of those rushing records in the first half thats cool
gonna go make a coffee
to everyone wondering about playoff teams we could face
ok tucker wiping down the mirror and turning into a chicken was definitely something else
how are we feeling
3rd quarter here we go
that spero dedes is a handsome man
hunmps is playing like hes tiredhurting
defense starting to look soft again
bernard is good im impressed with how bottled up weve kept him
fuck that wouldve been a pick 6
good stop lets get a score and put these guys to bed
the way scores are shaping up its conceivable that the bills and dolphins could play twice in a row and that the steelers and browns could play twice in a row
i want lamar to break off a 80 yard run and see how fast he can go
forgot to snap it lol
averett playing nice finally
how many more yards for 1k for my man lamar
will mekari be back for potential playoffs
i dont like seeing dobbins doing that elliot thing dont mimic that weirdo
the first half was their defense fresh against our running game this could get spicy
what a sprint did that put him over 1k
lamar needs 2 more yards
ez money
now that was a fuxking formation lol
this is too easy
ez money
jk making it look like a jk
i guarantee you someone at halftime told lamar he needed a few more yards to hit 1000 two years in a row lmao
good job dobbins love ya 27
bowser too damn fast to be that big
lamar gonna do 1100 at this rate
i fucking love week 17 best week of the regular season by far
thats my hokie ayyyy
dolphins choking hard
clark is steady
is our front 7 talked about lol
good pass coverage from the safeties today
i totally forgot aj green was playing lol
lol insult meet injury
lmao and the flag
anyone watching the pitcle game besides the score how they both look one with the backups the other one with a few missing players
oof overthrown
now he better not take a sack lol
gus the bus
we can just run at will
gusss
scott hansen missed talking about the 1k
three headed dragon
gusbus just keeps going
gus a grown man
gus girth keeps penetrating the bengals defense
god i love gus edwards

absolutely picking this defense apart
soulja

lets hunt

bengals suck so much
nice run

huntley almost caught dobbins tho holy shit
the man is unstoppable in ohio
pratt got stiff armed hahahahahah
were hitting on all cylinders at the right time 2021 i already love you lol
baby dobbins is crazy
if the ravens score 50 ive got a rider out for some big bucks
sit him play justice hill
dobbins top back in the making
love me some jk so glad we got him
single game team rushing yards record or bust
best rushing team in history for two years now
jk is bae
a quick google shows giants hold the record at 423 against baltimore colts in 1959 lets keep this going and break that record
it results hold itll be either titans or colts next week
do we even have anyone to put in at qb in the 4th
aww man put it on the 1 more opportunity for yards lol
how close r we to breaking the record for the most rushing yards in a game
cant blame them for trying at this point
good throw
mark looks like he got some burst back
big boi sighting
how do you guys feel we match up against the bucs
time to get ingram hot going into playoff szn
f
nooooooo
oh damn
someone said 26 someone said 3 what is it for the record
not that we dont already have amazing rbs but its fun to imagine nick chubb in this offense
no real offseason for dobbins and he has had a monster season cant wait to see what happens next season
aj green looking dejected instead of catching bullshit tip passes is almost tough to take almost
nice 3 and out
even luck tryna help us with this rush record cause that should have been a completed pass lol plenty of time boys lets get up to 500
lets go record time
another audible that did jack shit lmao
whats up with only 2 punt returns
lets get this record
does anyone know if the titans are having any fans at games
the record is toast
more rushing yards cross 400
imagine lamar gets 1k we set the new single game rushing record and we dont even allow a third down conversion in one game
24
how many yards we need for the record
damn i really want that record
if lamar wasnt a rookie we would have stomped the chargers and maybe even won the super bowl since we had the beat defense in the league
omgomgomg hes getting a punt
so proud of dobbins this season
wont need to make the plays down 10 to come back cause we wont be down 10 i hope
wow hill was held the entire way
huntley isnt going to get us those yards
who punted
huntley goes to the exact same spot on every run so far lol
huntley is a very skittish runner hell learn to just take a lane and go
watching this slow burn is so enjoyable the curse of 2017 is lifted
i get that were tying to kill the clock but lets beat the record
i already knew how spoiled we were with lamar but seeing huntley out there makes it clear as day
man were not getting this rushing record are we
bs
bruhhh
thats a pick
give us the record
baltimore rushed for just 3 yards on a 3andout although that did let them top the 400yard mark 51 carries 401 yards right now with 6 minutes to go only the 4th 400yard rushing game in nfl history plus another aafc game and only the 2nd in the last 60 years fbgchase
challengeeeee

edit oh we did nice one harbs
thanks
thank you
wink and harbs are just going to pour it on these bengals
2nd impressionof brandon allen watched him 1x before when he was in denver

his arm talent is ok his lack of quick twitch processing hurts him the most any bad decision he makes will be amplified as itll most likely be made late
we probs get one first down and then kneel need just one big run for the record though
boys we aint gettin it
ugh just need one run to break for huge yardage
steelers down by 8 but driving just converted a 4th down
weak give the kid a shot
fake the punt
huntley sleeping today
lamar back 2 back 1000 yard seasons jk dobbins eating were ready for playoffs
run on 4th
fumble for a recovery and touchdownrecord broken
if the browns play the steelers next week when theyre possibly gonna lose to rudolph this week
reject forward pass return to run
playoffs babeeeee
i hate those last 2 possessions
playoff bound
td not browns uh oh
19 yards away and huntley and ingram get like 10 yards on 12 carries


shit justice hill had 15 on one carry and we didnt give it to him anymore
was hoping townsend would just say fuck it and run for like 30 yards lol
hollywood is ass point blank you cant change my mind
im not afraid of the titans just hold henry under 80 yards cover aj brown you should be good
hot take ill be happy to see the browns make the playoffs its been a long time coming for them

if we ever meet in the playoffs though fuck them
bengals defensive game plan

1 try to catch lamar

2 say fuck as he runs past you

3 line up for next play repeat
well you cant have a much more obvious block in the back than that one
that was the worst block in the back to take ive ever seen utterly idiotic when the guy is already by you

thats why youll never get onto an nfl roster fulltime scrub
soulja drop
can we please stop forcing passes
dude pass the ball at a normal height whats up with the low passes
gotta stop throwing side arm
i dont understand why ingram is playing today
i really dont want to go to tennessee
daily reminder that the weeknd was robbed
bollywood back at it again
elliott talented but inexperienced
the ravens d has one of these implosion drives in the 3rd q of every game lol
take lamar out of the game now please
sad but ingram just doesnt have it anymore
4 yards to be 2 i wouldve taken that
fire greg roman for not getting the record
ingram is just terrible
unpopular opinion i think aj green might be a good addition next year i know hes not as flashy and explosive as a lot of people want from a guy like robinson or golladay and i think either of those guys would be better and should be priority 1 and 2 but while greens speed is gone his hands and height are as good as ever if we miss out on the first two giving lamar a huge target with that kind of physical 5050 catch ability would be a nice shot in the arm
i just want one playoff win this year and ill be happy dont see us getting past buffalo or kc but lets get just one dub
removed
i think well see a lot of ingram today one last chance for him to ball out in a ravens uniform and it will give edwards and dobbins some rest after a tough past couple weeks
as someone who hasnt been able to watch much football this year whats the situation heading into this game
roman in true form already
roman is back
miles soulja boykin
tcc is getting killed by hunt
god damnit lamar you need to see the left side of the field how the fuck is this not coached he always has a screen
keep throwing the ball lets get our passing game going we know we can run already
can they beat teams with the pass

jfc i thought announcers were past asking this
do you guys think if we had to pay andrews top te money if we should still take him
our offense is playing defense for them with penalties
holy shit a sail concept on fourth down like an actual factual effective route combination
quietly andrews has had a very average season not including covid
those state farm commercials are so cringy
the dolphins are getting penetrated by the bills rn
oh look another year i wont watch the emmys
is wap nominated for any grammys this year
okay lamar get that 1k rushing then lets get him the hell out of here
what happened to your linemen on the sideline99 look like someone shot him

the bengals will get the upset
man huntley really isnt that good at running huh lol
love clark but man you gotta do something about that hair homie
trace wouldve got the rushing record
i cry cuz we didnt break the record
strongest division this year
i feel like lamar runs when he doesnt need to and doesnt run when he needs to
that was a gift lamar you got a break literally the from the same guy the play before
so we go up by 10 and immediately stop running the ball god dammit greg
this team is fucking insane i dont wanna get ahead of myself but were the secondbest in the afc right now behind buffalo and even then you can argue both kc is most talented but not playing amazing
should we sign aj greene
huntley is so fucking bad at running
guys is lamar sick or slow please tell me no i want sewell
well he just tore his acl
dude ingram fucking sucks good lord what a cliff hes fallen off
we got this boys
who is our punter
hoping for a big game from queen today get the young guy a boost of confidence and momentum leading into the playoffs especially if were going to be lined up against tennessee next week
lfg
does anyone know how i can watch it from out of state
man we are missing quite a few starters im hoping for a skura redemption game
so hyped
time to tcb
who is starting at center
here we go
lets bangem and blankem as we punch in our playoff ticket today
chris moore is a captain
fuck the bengals lets punch our playoff ticket
time to tcb like elvis
seriously cbs do you have to replay that
weve lost like 12 tosses this year
lets fucking gooooooo
lmao zach taylor has one road win like i get how this guy isnt on the hot seat cause of injuries and other factors but next year should be a prove it year for him
i thought gus had the doubtful tag and would likely be either an active inactive or not used much i guess i either misread or he is feeling good enough to see normal usageish right now i know we are only 2 plays in
lol they put ab i drafted rookie over skura and im happy bout it
sucks for mekari went from a starter to inactive cause of back spasms
lol maybe a little more hustle 70
one more game
x200b

lamar jackson scrambled eggs
lets keep pounding the ball
cool to see mark out there had a good burst there
ingrams back
lead blockers like fuck it lamars got legs
lamar might get 1000 today
release the llama
i cant help but imagine what some good receivers would do with all the time lamar has in the pocket an old tired take but i wouldnt be a ravens fan without it
on lamars wristband

find 57
good run
63 looking solid out there
look at him dart back and forth
i can feel the lamar explosion
duv
why am i crying seeing ingram
duuvvvvvv
duv
duuuuuuuuuv
duuuuuu
good play roman
ingrams gotta be feeling fresh
yes pound that rock
hope mark can maybe get some big plays today likely his last game in a ravens uni unfortunately
big mix of guys getting it done
i made a bet that the ravens will get 300 rushing yards today

i think im going to win that bet
ricard sealing the edge there is incredible awesome play
what was that
damn that drive fizzled
i hope koch doesnt slip townsend spiked marshmallows for trying to take his spot in the wolfpack
running on 3rd and 10 roman has one more dumbass move like that and he needs to go
lets hope the defense comes to play
didnt like that play call on 3rd and 10 why are we running up the middle and not passing that was too conservative
why would he run that out lol
anyone know what kind of money aj greene is looking for
okay defense
defense already sucks i see
is burrow hurt
fuck

not tee
that sucks
woo that was close
damn lol a penalty takes back that and he pulls his hamstring bad tough
insult to injury there sheesh hate to see it lol
i was wondering why he kind of just slowed down and fell
oh man that doesnt look good for higgins hope its not too serious but he sounded like he was in a lot of pain
and that hit couldve been bad as well
sampled got popped
higgins has looked so good this year wtf happened there
this thread being ahead of my stream is a blessing and a curse im always anxious af and finding out how we fucked up or did well before it happens is bittersweet
good opi call but holy fuck not needed higgins toasted him off the line
terrible block in the back right at the lead there
what a hit by chuck
3 and out lets go
if i took a hit like that id take my pads off and go home
omfg man
ffs hollywood come the fuck on

those deep passes always make me nervous
oh hollywood
lmfao pratt is just a complete dumbass holding
bollywood
ahhhhhhhhh darn just could have been sooooooo pretty
soulja wtf
s
ugh
how in the hell we got a cb wearing 17 lmao
that was a heckin pass
cmon hollywood you gotta catch that
soulja boy why
souljaaaa
soulja please why

great impact blocking from gus
cement hands strikes again
goddamn it soulja
once we have julio as wr1 and hollywood in the slot
i saw a whack mock draft that somehow had us drafting devonta scott thats fucking impossible but imagine if it somehow happened
wonder if they told lamar to go crazy this game would be crazy for him to get another 1k season
soulja
aj brown dk mclaurin
does 3 backs
run the ball run the ball etc
i know the play against cleveland was huge but that might be my favourite throw of lamars this year read the play super early into bracket coverage and just right on him
mr smallhands
ever since 15 complained about using him more hes been a hot mess smh
did hollywood have dropping issues back in oklahoma
boykin great throw
lets gooo
beautiful throw
they ran the madden cheese route and he still couldnt catch it
dropping dimes
boykin baby
boykin new brown
lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
lfg
oooooh yes
hell yeah
oh babyyyyyyyyyyy
ez
lets gooooooooooooooo
im really happy to see lamar confident in throwing bombs again
ight lets keep doing that boys keep the foot on the gas after that higgins play im starting to clam down
why is brown still the outside threat hes not a threat
who was that with the face paint on every inch of his face
23 looks good out there
lmao
who else really wants to see lamar hit 1000 rushing today
yeah baby
bowser is so good lol
what a near perfect start
averett got off that block well
we need a new receiver badly
give it to ricard i want to see this lmao
im glad edwards is looking healthy
bozeman bear hugged him another 5 yards
was there a movie poster this week i didnt see it
that was 2 ugly throws back to back
gotta get that arm and those balls up
welp suit up defense
fuck
guy was wide open hunt just had to be a huge cunt
lets go
good ass coverage got damn ran him out of bounds
who released themselves there
nice play
chris board outplaying queen lol
throw over hunt ballgame
lets get another deep shot and flip the field
lmao no shit last drive the announcer said to beat the ravens on defense you have to play good in the redzone get sacks and create turnovers
buccs are gonna make some serious noise in the playoffs
lamar jacksons interception doesnt cost the ravens baltimore defense forces a third straight threeandout on three series bengals have been held to 7 yards and no first downs on nine plays jamisonhensley
f
thats my llama
lol can the drive please not stall after that stiff arm we have to score after that
yo can someone catch today come on thats a dime between 3 dudes
we should drop back to pass on every play but then let lamar run
dobbins has been blocking like a boss this game
4 people on one side of the field nice
hey does cincy play crossers well no one has said anything yet
come on
how many more till 1000 for lamar
does anyone have a highlight of hollywoods stiff arm
every team in our division has the drops this year it seems
if our receivers hold on to the ball this is a contender team
damn he almost had that looks like it was knocked loose
that edwards run reminds me of some old leveon bell
fuck sake
theres the illegal formation
hopefully then bengals get healthy during the offseason
tired of these flags
looks like were going to be playing tennessee or indianapolis
nice strike on the rollout hate the rollout call though it limits the field for lamar to run
you better catch it brown
gustoooo
soulja
oh look he caught it
brown td
soulja got it
that there be the game
brownnn
soulja
king soulja
he caught it holy shit
so who can we possibly play next week
thats where perine ended up
why doesnt allen have a speaker in his helmet
dammit bills stop it
how many offensive pi are they gonna let them get away with
feeling a fake
i asked for 200 at half but ill take 203
cowards
were they just playing 7 nation army
cant wait for the bengals offense to come back out

wink is gonna have something special for them
taylors strategy is clearly to piss wink off so much he comes on the field and gets tossed
steelers another fg 106
cmon dolphins get your shit together i wanna play pittsburgh

do we care about the dolphins bills game if so why
have the tits clinched the playoffs
lets gooooooo d
where is jackson at on rushing yards
someone send the who plays who playoff table someone sent in reply to a comment again please i have lost it
fuck another first
averett with another nice play
tee higgins out for the rest of the game
the record is close
who remembers those pitch plays from the pittsburgh game
lets goo
get llama to 1k
fluker is so slow lol
we shouldnt throw the ball another time today
cant tackle him
oooo big runs lets go
nah let our lineman come up those 2 alone can push for a td
how close is lamar now
goddamn were running them over
looked like dez was holding there but ill take it lmao

edit dez not gus
is it just me or does is sound like this announcer keeps saying jetson
10 more yards
touchdownnnnn ravens
my man
lamar is gonna get 5 more yards then kneel twice at the end of the game
ooh yeah
im watching the steelers game i know were currently beating the bengals by a lot but how are we looking today
what a damn play by clark
did someone get killed
keep bringing the heat wink
yeah aj green is definitely not staying
man i miss ed reed
yikes thats a probable wrap on this game
bengals are double checking their vacation itineraries
i thought he might have been outside the pocket nice
good times 4x the yards 4x the 1st downs
hmm i want to see duv take off quicker on these returns hes overthinking things by trying to be so shifty pick a lane and take it
dj hollywood fluker
williams was like jackson where we going im sticking with you lol
fins score 2813 now
cc going hard there love it
congrats to demeatrice jr
soulja been hitting the gym
soulja
huntley time boys
nice play
the browns are actual fucking garbage a 1 point lead over the steelers preseason team ffs
there you go soulja
steelers must have been sleepwalking vs this team
browns looking iffy against the rudolphs
time to bring on the juke king tyler huntley
browns just scored a td
marlos fast when hes awake
if all games stay on the path theyre on ravens bills browns win then were likely playing titans again in the first roundnot something i like whatsoever

pratt lmaooooooo
dobbins is a beast
we own the bengals
dobbins
holy fuck
were going into the playoffs looking hot couldnt ask for more at this point loving it
lol lets fucking go
ive been waiting all season for that

stop stop theyre already dead
we got hot exactly when we needed to
free elf 27
lmao
holy christ we still have a whole quarter
wow i thought it was gunna be a close game

lets goo
what a play by bowser there
thats a great tfl
im ready for the playoffs man
bengals about to forfeit so they dont end up on the wrong side of the record book
i looked it up ceh swift taylor and cam akers all went ahead of dobby
why is andrews in the game
ingram my boy
58 more yards
yessir lets go hill
if the bengals were an nfc team id buy one of their white jerseys cause they look pretty good ngl
bring em to justice
crush them into the dirt
that was terrible lol
mcsorely still injured
lol who is brooks 17
everytime i see that stupid verizon commercial


we gotta go
another 3 and out for the defense
how much more for the record
fuck chase claypool
so does it look like were gonna play the titans
ingram is ready for the playoffs this year
put jackson in until we get the record lol
come on
noooooooo
let these dudes score so we can get the ball back and get this record
theres still hope if we can make a stop or get a turnover
how much more for the record
can this announcer talk to someone without saying their name every sentence
anyone know where proche was this game
chuck
lets go
damn
pain
fuck that defense cant stop them them when it really matters
browns just gave the pft the ball on downs one score game
lmao jihad
what special food do i eat for the playoffs
now thats some chuck yardage
f
browns about to browns
if they hand it off to duvernay there its a 1st lmao
why not run it with a running back at least
lets go
that is upsetting
come on yinzers beat the browns with your jv squad
jesus christ we took our foot off the gas
4 out lets break it
why didnt zt call a timeout for the fg wth
playoff time
what happens to the browns if they lose
playoffffffs
what record
f for the record
whats happening in the browns
f
knock out the browns
ooo
playoffs baby
who yall rootin for in the second window
lamar looks slow today
that was such an ugly cut from hollywood felt like it was in slow motion compared to the elite footwork guys
im still nervous for whatever reason
mcsorley not seeing the field until the llama notches 1k
defense taking their scheduled vacation again
so its ravens vs steelers if titans win
football
bruh why have i seen more ravens fans scared of the bengals than ive seen browns fans scared of the steelers i seriously think the steelers beat them today
is it just me or did lamar look slow on that run
well that should be a wrap if higgins is out he is electric
he fucking sucks hes a terrible belowreplacement level player and he needs to be cut
soulja boy
this run game is a bit uninspiring at times hopefully we break off a few big ones soon
thats my boykin
did he just say queen city

charlotte nc as i last heard is the queen city
bruh
lamar has to stop doing multiple hitches urban needs to coach that out of him if its not there just run same thing happened against steelers where he hitched multiple times and fumbled and against the titans in the playoffs
we just need to put this game away before the 4th so the refs cant decide the outcome
im worried some team is gonna take roman from us and hire him as hc
if the bills and dolphins both win we play the titans in the wild card
kittle kelce and waller come down with that one
100 against bengals more than likely gets you in the playoffs ravens have a decent shot at the postseason
crazy how different the defense can look from one drive to the next
so do we want the steelers or browns to win
when does miami put in fitzmagic

edit im a moron
ugh if we play the titans and they knock us out again im gonna be so pissed
yo you had a pick 6 dog
when did jackson throw a pick i must have not been paying attention
anyone think it would be worth scooping aj green for the low
defense falling asleep as usual lol
legit better than ray rice
oof idk this will be close how manny yards we need
great play by clark but how he landed on his right leg was scary for a moment
actually salt we didnt get the record
omg browns
touchdown steelers need 2 to tie
ingram is back active 1st and 10 runs for 2 yards are back on the menu ingregwetruzz
i almost hate when he does something good makes it even harder to swallow the jv shit
sweet lol
i really dont want us to play the titans
removed
look im taking credit for hollywoods resilience souljia memes have kept him fighting thru adversity s
hot take hollywood is a good receiver that people keep unreasonably expecting mvp performance from
hoping we can get green in fa

my only issue is attitude but i think hed bring a lot to the team
aj come to baltimore
damn were literally fisting the bengals d balls fucking deep
too bad lamars not very accurate
good play by hubbard there cincy bengals have a sneaky good linebacker room
the bengals are a joke
if higgins didnt get hurt he was gone
soulja back at it
nice throw just a good play by the db
soulja caught something
he had number 27
if the we win and the bills steelers and colts win does that mean the wildcard teams are the ravens colts and dolphins
bengals helmets are too nice
he still isnt catching with his hands is there an injury we arent privy to i dont remember this being an issue last year
this fukkin d
2 pt conversion no good browns lead 2422
lfg playoff time boys
i just finished a leg workout and im pooped should i still go running or just go on a walk instead
whos the dipshit who said i was dumb and that our olb corps and front 7 was as good as 2014 with doom suggs ngata mosley williams guy a few weeks ago

you are retarded
everyone knows 3rd and 10 lamar is keeping it and not throwing
wow our team is officially trash i guess

good teams quadruple the spread

i just finished a leg workout and im pooped should i still go running or just go on a walk instead
good news guys god is helping
okay time to bench lamar
fucking pathetic harbaugh
removed
defence is collapsing early this game shocker

calling for a challenge in a 303 game with 230 left no class surprised they didnt celebrate in the other end zone after the call got over turned
unpopular opinion but this ravens team is a likely one and done no killer instinct

removed

yannick
kinda brutal were missing yannick in a mustwin game
really curious whats going on with proche coach always seems talk so highly of him i hope he has a future here
fergy gonna feast today
dawg why is proche getting scratched man hasnt screwed up once returning punts
wheres yannick

string

string


where the fuck is yannick
kinda sucks mekari is out hopefully skura can clean up his snap game
damn this explains why i always mistakenly call brandon ellis justin ellis


view poll
stupid ass
if anybody clicks no do they land in the orioles sub
i think that the vast majority of bengals fans think the ravens are going to make the playoffs

also seems like gus is a bit banged up


ravens lotr yes please

do you remember the taste of eye black mr justin


view poll
i wouldve liked a maybe option
the only reason i said not a chance is because typically against lesser opponents we tend to try and kill them with our pass game instead of relying on the strength of our offense all of lamars best passing games usually come with sub 30 yards rushing i could be wrong though and would be happy if i am lol
looks like yes lol
not probable he needs to break off a long run to have a chance
well be resting starters by the fourth quarter and theres no need to give him those kinds of carries to beat the lowly bengals its always possible he rips off a long one but i voted as if im betting the deed to the ranch


ravens inactives yannick ngakoue jimmy smith willie snead patrick mekari james proche justin ellis broderick washington

bengals inactives randy bullock k mackensie alexander cb william jackson iii cb logan wilson lb alex redmond g keaton sutherland g mitchell wilcox te

mark ingram is active for the ravens today both starting cbs for the bengals are inactive

note sam koch and bengals dt mike daniels are not listed as inactive as they are out on the reservecovid19 list
both starting cbs for the bengals are inactive

insert gif of guy hiding behind the tree licking his lips
i want to here you guys score predictions
3113
i bet they pull off the field goal bs again 313
3814
the other day i had a dream that we won 850 lmao

but real talk i think well win by 23 touchdowns
2724


edit im happy to be looking wrong
386 hopefully resting some starters after being up 350 at the start of the 4th
realistically they only scored 3 with joe burrow and now they have a backup and plus were playing really well so i think they score less than 10 and we score 30
350
400

wink sets a sack record to really sting taylor after that field goal bullshit
3620
307
im hoping 4510 so we can rest some guys but imma say 2710
4513
48 13

upvoted

but to be that guy

were lmao
records arent accurate but this is cool
if we win then browns win and the colts win is it the colts that miss the playoffs

he has 1 year left on his contract and if he wants to leave to go to a contender the texans can cut him and not have to pay his last year so he may tell them he wants to leave and then theyll cut him
hes not leaving houston i assume hed retire before leaving that city he is that city
too expensive right
for sure hes the prototype 34 end and a class locker room and community guy question is what he will cost

throw von miller in the mix too
nah hes not a team player
is for us to beat the bengals and for the steelers and browns to tie
and a super bowl
i have had a nice fully stitched black ray rice jersey sitting in the closet for years does anyone know if i can buy a dobbins name plate to cover up rice would be nice to get this one back in circulation
idk a person or anything but thats a great idea honestly
sew a blank patch over rice iron on dobbins name
im in the exact same situation hoping to give an older jersey some new life this is an older post from another thread but i think itll help best of luck


a half decent tailor could probably make it happen
i have the cbs app and unfortunately its showing the steelersbrowns game is there a way i can switch it so that i can see the ravens game
nfl bite dot com

ive been trying with no success so if someone knows that would be great
what is with everyone and forgetting about justin tucker its pretty indisputable that hes the best in the league and its not even close
i think its all to do with personality koo is hot rn because of his storybackground tucker is boring because hes been good for so long no one cares that he can sing in multiple languages even though thats pretty cool

its just recency bias objectively tucker is the best kicker and is probably going to be the goat
that discussion doesnt include tucker anymore whoever they say is the best is really 2nd best
they dont include tucker in the rankings due to it being so obvious hes the best because it doesnt sound as good to say x is the 2nd best kicker
i suppose if better means you are less accurate in both fgs xps and your career long is 7 yards shorter all while kicking indoors and in the sun belt vs the midwest then yeah hes better
didnt he miss a tying kick last week
is tucker still considered to kick a lot in comparison to other kickers ive watched the ravens forever and obviously am a huge fan of jt and think hes the best but compared to years with flacco i feel like jt doesnt kick as much or have as many chances to kick longer field goals
its just mj syndrome mjs prime was so insane that writers got bored heaping praise

theres no reason to get annoyed others make the claim every year and fall back to above average
ghost boswell bailey lutz butker this list goes on

go back to the cleveland game a few weeks ago tucker needed a 51yd fg to win the game every single ravens fan and most afcn foes knew that the game was over the moment we got within 60 yards stephanski didnt bother trying to ice tucker he knew it was over

id rather have that comfort than let commenters try to trigger me by claiming tucker is not the goat
hes scored the most points in the nfl but his experience showed last week in the late miss tucker is clutch
i like youngwoe koo but i bet 3132 gms in the league would disagree if they could choose between tucker and koo
anyone who knows anything about football heard that and immediately thought well except for tuck obviously
red zone leans heavy into fantasy tucker is ranked lower than koo in fantasy mostly because ravens score more than the falcons
dumb af
i mean hes having a phenomenal season and tucker isnt kicking at a super high clip with lamar because the offense is so efficient justin tucker is obviously an all time great but we can acknowledge that other kickers are having amazing seasons too its okay


start targeting boykin more
im so happy lamars deep ball is looking good we can find a mf to catch duv fast af too but he on point and that matters most hollywood will get it together imo
again brown tried to body catch that and of course he dropped it been body catching all season
he has been doing better recently just gotta be patient with him i still think he can be a good reciever
i truly belee lamar will put a lot of work in with soulja 1 before camp hes got to get his guy right this offseason
duvernay needs to be more of the receiving game plan he reminds me of steve smith hollywood is really going backwards he is talented but inconsistent i am still perplexed we picked him over metcalf in the draft a few years back oh well hope he turns it on in the playoffs
brown has pretty good hands when he uses them i dont understand why hes been doing body catches all season between himself and the coaching staff you would think this is something that could be corrected

that said lately hes creating separation and putting points in the board so im not about to pile on him
brown is having his best game since weekend of last year
and he scores
aged like milk
bollywood brown hollywood boykin
he catching tuddies so thats all that matters
i knew someone was going to post this and im glad

if youre gonna call out the coaching staff you better catch the ball when your number is called
grow tf up whats the point of having fans if they relentlessly taunt our players every time they make a mistake other than one heated postgame tweet hollywood has been a consummate professional worked unbelievably hard like every day this offseason improved in yards and touchdowns still has a ton of potential
man you sound kinda dumb now huh
the hate is ridiculous hes in his second year putting up solid numbers and plays for such a shitty recieving core buncha sensitive sallies up in here from one tweet
he just sucks can only catch the ball if there are no defenders on a 10 feet radius

thanks for getting the best angle of the play
can see shit
wtf am i watching
except you can because hes running full speed and the pass was behind him
thats not the bad one the infuriating drop was the screen pass where brown just was asleep
cant excuse this shit video
does anyone else feel like since dez was signed to the 53 man roster boykin has really stepped up in a big way

that post was a good route a nice fake to make the back open his hips outside and then cut back inside

hes had what 3tds in the last 4 games something like that really pleased with his development lately
boykin isnt bad he has the size we are just really bad at developing receivers imo his only problem is his route running he cant cut well and fool the defense yet i agree that dez has definitely helped boykin step up
hes still only being targeted 12 times a game and catching 1 ball a game i think its more a matter of where those targets are occurring rather than him developing further
the guy blocks like a beast on that alone he is valuable to us for our run game but hes a size specimen though not the fastest guy solid hands hell be a nice complementary piece as a 3rd rounder but we probably shouldnt hold out hope for the next mike wallace and thats ok
based on social media dez definitely seems to have taken him under his wing so its very possible that boykins recent emergence has something to do with it i mean weeks went by where i completely forgot boykin was on the team even though he played tons of snaps id still like him to show up more than once or twice a game though even if those appearances are td catches
i cant believe that was just said on air lol
they dont call him a bus for now reason
he got that girth certificate
blowing out all the walls
hits the hole deeeeeeep
so its settled his new name is girth edwards
cant wrap him up
announcer is a little sus ngl
does anyone have a clip of this
thats what she said
burst through the seam
this and the announcers saying probed was sus
gus dummy thicc
i heard that shit too i was so weak
you cant ignore my girth gus edwards

our game threads have been tainted by the success of last season we expect utter dominance against everyone lol well come back down to earth our offense is not containable for 4 quarters
removed
the ravens are to illegal formation as i am to leaving my la croix cans all around the house no matter how many times my wife bitches at me i keep fucking it up

yes
if we get 1 more well break it were tied with the 2019 texans and 2018 bills with 7
this is starting to kill me
we seem to get like 20 every game smfh
this game i was just going to say i got my drinking game right with that one
the ravens do more shifts and motions than any other team in the nfl its a double edged sword it gets defenses out of position but there are going to be motionshiftformation penalties

did he catch with his hands instead of his body is that allowed asking for a soulja
love dez getting in on that

camera guy we all heard you take a big old hit of schneef there
i feel like boykin could be a monster one day
eazy money baby
hey can i g

shhhhhhhhhhhh
easiest catch miles had all year such a goddamn beautiful throw
nice to see boykins actually get a target if i had a single criticism of lamar this year its locking into his tes and often completely missing brownboykins wide open just a great pitch and catch id love to see more of it
where can i buy that didnt see it on nfl shop
it may be route 1 not positive tho
he always has the best gatorsmasks
found it



things seem to be much more stable with bozeman coloncastillo and powers when stanley is back next season zeus jr goes back to right tackle thoughts
our line will be nasty with stanley back well have a lot of depth in the interior with tyre coloncostillo powers mekari and boze to choose from

with those guys boyle our run blocking will be sight to behold when we bring in extra guys
i dont think we can afford to keep zeus after this season unless he takes a homer discount hed be insanely valuable in the lt trade market rn
took awhile but they improved drastically

you guys are too soft
hes only called him a back which he is a quarterback
iirc he called him a back which he is
cool with another 1000 yds season under his belt
thought i was the only one
just confused and dont know as much to figure out the tie break cause i look at stats and see ravens winning in all categories
they have a better conference record so they have a better record against afc teams therefore they win the tie breaker
theres no doubt in my mind that hes a top 2 priority in contract extensions ingram was great for us but hes not like he used to be dobbins is amazing but i think edwards is key in our 3rd4th and short plays we can argue multiple defensive players that deserve an extension edwards will allow us to continue our bread and butter the run game not to mention will open lamar up to throw more and hes only gotten better with age in accuracy and decision making
hes a vital part of our offense we better extend him



view poll
bills that defense and allendiggs is a scary sight right now
the bills are fucking scary to me right now
i read it wrong thats why i voted for steelers bills obviously
if jimmys back i think we match up very well with buffalo besides pitt they are who i would most want to play

finally a shirt that beats out the footbirds
now we just a need a bot to ask where can i buy this and another bot to drop the link
why why do we get illegal formation every week
is it because we are being too artistic too complex
cant we just calm down and gain yards
where can i get the black shirt love it
i want royalties for this idea
ngl the black shirt looks good
11 illegal formation penalties in 16 games next closest team has 5 haha


runner ups illegal shift ineligible man
every game i love this
grabs crouch i got your illegal formation right here
lmaooo love it
at least once a game
press f to pay respects
lol
lmao this is good
whats so hard about reporting as an eligible receiver
a must have for any ravens fan
death taxes and illegal formation

on topic id buy one of these if they came out
top tier drip
the purple is fire
i am so proud of this community
this is funny af lmao
but is this real cuz id wear tf outta this
youre welcome for the black shirt edit idea lol
to innovate you gotta make some mistakes
low key would really wear this
anyone know where else you could get this someone listed a link but its a little pricey i know theres gotta be a better deal
its the defensive pass interference calls every week that do me in
send me the link
was watching the game yesterday with my roommate and i was talking about how we are due for an illegal formation penalty sure as shit it happened as we were talking about it and i was the leo meme pointing at the tv

need this shirt in my life
dont we get illegal shift a lot as well
where does one purchase this

now its 47
this stat is the perfect response to the wilson fan jackson faders

seahawks fans wilson is a significantly better passer than jackson

response jackson has 47 red zone tds and zero ints does wilson have a red zone int sore subject
crazy stat
is that good
delete this shit right fucking now
jinx
lamar jackson in the red zone in his career 46 td 0 int

lets take a moment to recognize this man and his willingness to take on a new role this season there arent many backs who would be so easy to handle with a shift like this we all see that jk and gus are our best options but i hope ingram knows that baltimore loves him all the same i still believe he is a big part of the glue that holds the squad together big truss
i hope he gets the fourth quarter carries he deserves them
yeah hated hearing that announcer say he was cast away
i remember ingram talking about how excited he was to help jk learn the ropes and improve himself for the nfl after we drafted him dude saw his replacement walk in the door and his first response was to help him do his job as well as possible he seemed so excited to mentor him that i dont think he or gus would be how they are now without him

ingram was the emotional heart of this team last year hes the kind of teammate all of us dreamed of having as kids and in the likely scenario that this was hist last season as a raven i really hope we can get him a ring as a parting gift
this makes me wanna cry i absolutely love the energy he gives from the side line post game conferences wether he is dressed or not we love you kid ur not forgotten your role is major in the bank
the way ingram is described is like hes old and i just realized hes 6 months older than me

damnit
hes definitely a glue guy which is what aaron rodgers used to describe marcedes lewis on the pat mcafee show and they keep talking of the importance of glue guys in bringing the locker room together
dont know how many of you guys watch the ravens wired series they youtube channel does but you can hear how supportive he is to jk on it in the early weeks during games
he made a couple of good runs even when huntley got a little lost out there all it takes is one injury and we need him big time love his attitude
i think he is going to come up big in a playoff game
i love this man even if you look back at his time on the saints he was the biggest kamara supporter from day 1 there too class act and brings something special to every team he is on i really hope he can find his way back to the ravens as part of the coaching staff one day
rip big truss woo woo
i love him he is a man of tremendous character and was integral to last seasons success but there is no reason why he should be getting any carries the burst is no longer there
his career speaks for itself he is an elite among elites
love the video of mark andrews making a big catch and ingram saying thats my son
hes been a great mentor to gus and jk but i hope to hell we dont see him in the titans game theres is just nothing explosive about him if he gets any carries at all roman is essentially throwing the game
ive looked at the probabilities of every game that matters every 5 minutes and created this neat graph showing the chance for each opponent to face the ravens in the wildcard round and the unlikely case that ravens miss the playoffs

the winning probabilities come from espn and i used excel to create the graph

ill try to update this post every 30 minutes

edit 945pm last update

what an ending its the revenge game


i want this rematch
we are the 5th seed unless some insanity happens in the second half
thanks i was actually wondering who were likely to play in the wc redemption arc would be exciting af
okay titans lets do this
unless miami pulls off a miracle its gonna be that afc south slot
wait how did you make this

yahoo sports app is free usually every week to watch on your phone
nflbite watch 90 of the games there cause im in ny
on the ravens app theyre streaming for free i believe through yahoo
do you have verizon wireless free via the nfl app
nfl app

agreed hes really picked up the play the second half of the season making the most of his game reps
yeah ive been impressed with him lately i considered him the liability on defense through the majority of the season but hes definitely improved
he was playing good before he just got hurt the last game or so hes really came around
green was ejectedgreen was the imposter
curious to see where we can find records of the coun toss it seems to me that the ravens have started off each of the last few games by receiving the ball rather than their customary kicking it off first
have they changed their strategy
we lost the toss today and the bengals deferred i feel like we almost always defer whenever we win but maybe weve just lost the toss more often recently not changed strategy

what is this from
i snorted this is great
that breaks the record by any qb in nfl history
what happens if he kneels 3 times at the end
how many qbs can throw 3 touchdowns in a game and it be irrelevant on sports talk monday generational talent

i can see him doing the same next year but ill take the under
not bad for a running back

hes having a off year
and he did it with a missed game too
legit future hof coming from a browns fan too lol
also the first qb to ever rush for 1000 twice
thats my quarterback
not bad for a running back gardner minshew


any chance lamar makes a case for comeback player of the year dude had a pretty bad mid season slump we lose 3 in a row he had covid missed a week and our season looked pretty much over comes back 5 weeks ago and has been putting on a show week in and week out since then
hollywood is so on and off its crazy
hes playing with heart today boy
he has the same number of drops as mark andrews who this sub defends to the death this sub gives him more shit than he deserves

nfl drop stats
hes gonna eat if hes our 2 next year

will always upvote a boys reference
atrain is almost as fast as lamar too
were not even they had nothing to lose
i wanted to drop 50 on them for that shit i will never forget the way they celebrated that win as if they won the fucking super bowl

ah well
only the boys and dbz memes until the end of the season
i was there row 19 it was cold very very cold aj green caught that in front of me additionally when dalton played for tcu i was a student at utah where he stomped our faces in several times dalton may not play for the bengals anymore but we will never be even he left some deep wounds
removed
coming right after he was super pissed over that pi that was incredible
ball dont lie

love me some utah utes turned ravens

its hilarious that the ravens dont have a team pic of him so they just shopped a ravens jersey on top lmao
lol
id like to make a compilation of haters talking trash and saying we wont make the playoffs
anyone remember this genius
people on this sub man
gonna disagree with the other 2 comments i would enjoy this video
someone please get a picture of dobbins just blowing past pratt on that last run that man needs to be reminded of that freezing cold tweet
pratt by name prat by nature

hes been looking like he will be a real star recently
throbbin for dobbins
he is so fucking fast turning the corner going up field massive props to roman for realizing that and getting him on sweeps
i always thought he was the best rb in the class was surprised he fell that much
he just looks like hes gonna be a star
i remember all the analysts and draft experts saying the ravens cant keep stealing elite draft picks year after year

dobbins was an absolute steal for this team
bruh it still baffles me
he is a rb it wasnt all that surprising
my steeler fan buddy was not happy that the ravens got him and not the steelers
make that bottom of the second round for the true effect
unfortunately he lacks girth
glad the rams didnt take him i wonder how good has cam akers been i actually have no clue


i was screaming for them to let huntley actually play qb and not just hand the ball off
lol i love scoring points
after years of them spoiling our seasons glad we get to embarrass them regularly
404 rushing yards 4th most on a game all time last team to do it was the bengals in 2000 lol
a very stupid and irrational part of me kinda hoped the bengals would score in the third quarter so lamar would play one more drive

cant help it i just love watching the dude play
this is the way


greg roman gets too little credit

from what i see they only need another 26 yards to break the single game rushing record by a team the record is 423 and they have 398 is 9 minutes left in the game
update 3 the ravens are now the 1st team in nfl history to rush for 3000 yards in consecutive seasons they needed 333 yards today to get to 3k seemed crazy but i should know better than to put anything past this historic rushing juggernaut cassiecalvert

i welcome the challengeif we want to win the lombardi we gotta pass teams like them to get there after everything we have been through as a team the injuries the losses covid outbreak the do or die moments the titans scares me nonei welcome this challenge any team any team fuck emits all or nothing

sic semper effodiant corvi
if you told me a year ago after that devastating loss were going to get a chance to redeem ourselves from that loss again next year against the same team i would think youre crazy but here we fucking are boys next week baltimore tennessee on nickelodeon
goddamnit if it isnt some fresh pasta

this is definitely even cringier than last years so congrats
aww shit here we go again
i like confidence but please no more meme material
we will be favored but that offense is legit and they deserve to be feared
as long as roman doesnt abandon the run we should be fine
you absolutely should be
im not afraid of the titans im afraid of henry lol
this is the way
im not afraid of the titans i am afraid of henry
the ravens are peaking at the exact right time no team wants to play the ravens right now

the revenge tour starts now smash tennessee
if we play to our level the titans defense will not be able to handle us if we lose it will be because we beat ourselves
im not afraid of them but theyre definitely dangerous and their offense is almost uniquely suited to attack our defense theyll be a tough out and i can easily see them winning

no man we were just talking about this the other day
its not over the bengals could score 25 unanswered brandon allen is a beast
uh
a post from a fan that clearly doesnt know the hurt this team has caused

think its safe to say now its a win
sorry guys i jumped the gun can we celebrate now

i love this team chemistry
band of brothers these guys love each other trusss love the flock glad were in the playoffs

why would we throw 30 times when we have the best running game in the nfl some people are so stupid i swear we playing football like were in 1965 and were winning

germaine pratts career

0 sacks

0 int

0 ff

7 qb hurries

18 missed tackles

830 completion percentage 86 yr 1153 qb rating 3 td when targeted

50 pff grade
career highlight for pratt
i want to see the high res game still of that stiff arm
ravens have 398 rushing yards right now

new york giants had 423 yards versus the baltimore colts in 1950 which is the most in nfl history

the cincinnati bengals had 407 yards in 2000 and the bears also had 398 yards also in 1955
lets fucking go
if lamar and dobbins were left in the last quarter they would have smashed the record but give em some rest let the 2ndstring qb and rb take a few yards
did we get it yet yall someone please update me
best rushing team in nfl history
i dunno cuz huntley is not running decisively and ingram cant shed a tackle
itll be expensive but a i think hes talented knows the afc north defenses and hasnt been overly dramatic despite dealing with a pathetic franchise
no lol hes washed
disappointed
no more aging wr hasbeens pls

weve tried this it doesnt work
we need a young stud someone to dominate snd become a true no 1 we dont need to add another washed up vet
no hate towards green but we already have a team full of 2 and 3s we dont need another unless we get rid of some
i dont get the hate hes incredibly talented and i think hes exactly what we need keep dez too
nay
no
please no
we have dez dont need him
im good honestly
no
plz god
no thanks
sounds awful
no

its classic harbaugh to let off the gas when we almost have some kinda pointless record i remember joe one time threw like 5 tds in a single half against tampa and we coulda had the franchise scoring record and he just stopped trying like injury yeah i get it but gimme the record lol



hollywood having a late season surge has made me happy
13 playoff appearances in 25 years of existence

we are beyond blessed to have this franchise
nope its over for them
fuck the browns and more importantly fuck the steelers
273 then 383 you cant say cincinnati isnt consistent
i wanted that single game record ngl
damn i was actually hoping the steelers would eliminate the browns
lamar jackson was asked about the possibility of a rematch with the titans its not about them its about us it really didnt matter who we were going to play ill be grateful with whoever we play im just happy we made the playoffs sgellison

jackson on ravens making the playoffs after overcoming so much its pretty cool but weve still got things we want to finish its just the beginning for us baltimoreluke
2 weeks ago the ravens might miss the playoffs at 115 wtf

now 5 seed i guess thats cool

alright now we root for the texans
man we couldnt let tucker kick it on that last 4th and 1 to get him back up to 90 on the season finished 2629

ravens hold our beers

im still used to the bengals being joes kryptonite theyre more like candy for lamar it seems

good bring on the titans
lets go whoop some titan ass
in the words of the little girl from remember the titans were gonna win states
browns recovered an onside kick first down wins it for them
with 404 yards rushing the ravens will become the 7th team since stats were first kept in 1933 to finish with 400 rushing yards in a game the 2000 bengals are the only other team to do this since the 1970 merger according to espnstatsinfo jamisonhensley
good game we still need work on getting a passrush
the titans are hoes on them we shall stunt
lets fucking go playoffs baby
we are going to the playofffffs

so who and when do we play
im so done with this division i dont wanna see pitt or clev i guess there are worse matchups and i like our chances a lot but afcn playoff games are rrrrough
during their fivegame winning streak to close the regular season the ravens averaged 2674 rushing yards per game jeffzrebiec
i hate the bengals so much less than the steelers or browns why do we have to go hardest on cincy i guess theyve been the worst of the three since lamar came to town
holy shit we might be going to indy
titans going deep into ot could help us if we end up facing them

edit forget it i guess lol
i know no one is talking about boykin but come on the dude has been way better for us lately i still believe he and hollywood could be great for years if miles can figure it out
joyeux festivus
lets go win some playoff games
wait what i thought it was over
i wanted the record but oh well we playoff bound babyyyyyyyy
full speed to nashville
browns win steelersbrowns next week
other than the chiefs game we had a shot to win each of our losses
back in the dance
playoff bound baby lets winn
steelers lost what do we think of this
how did lamar throw a pick
breathe
love this for us to the playoffs lets get that w
gonna be a long week cant wait
while i would never complain about a 383 win to get us in the playoffs it is a little scary that we didnt get a single sack today against a team that has turnstiles for a line
were on to the titans
the texans have put in a request to interview ravens director of football research scott cohen for their gm job per source hes worked with the coaching staff for the last two seasons but was a highranking personnel man before that for the bucs and jets rapsheet
bold prediction ravens vs seahawks super bowl lv
i would love to send tennessee to buffalo if they win they go to kc and we can avoid chiefs until afc championship
love lamar jim harbaugh and the gang 2020 was tuff 4 all of us by football delivered
my only guess as to why we slacked off on rushing so much is perhaps harbs doesnt want the team thinking about having set the record but rather focused on next week we completely stopped trying
was really hoping we wouldnt have to see tennessee again just a bad matchup all the way around
good luck against the ur dads in the first round lmao

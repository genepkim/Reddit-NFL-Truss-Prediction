"As a Browns fan who is frequently on the Browns sub, I can say with confidence that you're full of shit as far as the ""laughing at injuries"" comment goes. When the news broke about Dobbins and Gus, virtually all comments were wishing the Ravens luck with their injury situation. The one (most likely troll) comment that was glad about the Ravens injuries was **heavily** downvoted, and again, remember this is on the Browns sub."

Please throw a 400 yard game Lamar I would absolutely love it.  A great running game is cool too but I would just like to see an absolute air raid on this garbage secondary.
21/27 280 yards 3 TDs 50 rushing yards
One large order of a Jackson 5 on the wayüòà
For the season? I am going to say over 351

Ty'son gonna get 1k and get traded to the jets next year
"Idk why I have a feeling tyson is gonna feast. Not dobbins levels, but I think he can get 650-750ish yards as a lead back"
Definitely responded thinking it was all RBs and then saw Lamar on there after. The safe bet is Lamar at > 900 yards
"Don't forget about Trenton ""The Cannon"" Cannon"
I realize this is a Ty‚ÄôSon Williams subreddit but ya‚Äôll are sleeping on Latavius‚Ä¶ he gives you everything Gus does plus decent hands and proven blocking.

It‚Äôs about time Hollywood turns into a clone of his cousin lol I see he‚Äôs steadily packing on muscle üí™üèæ
Mark Andrews with Sammy in second assuming he‚Äôs healthy for all 17 games.  They attack the area of the field Lamar most heavily targets and I consider Sammy to be the best of our WRs imo.
Very difficult question (aside from the bottom two options lol) because I can see a scenario where it's any of the rest.
"Lol my pick is ridiculous but I think Bateman can win out, there‚Äôs a true hole in this offense for targets that are wide open for him to take, even despite missing 3 games I‚Äôm hopeful he will be our receiving leader and be the true WR1 we‚Äôve all been dreaming for üôèü•∫"
Its Batemans SZN
"Andrews not just because he is lamar‚Äôs favorite target, but also historically he‚Äôs been the healthiest option (proceeds to knock on every piece of wood I can find)."
"Heart says Hollywood, brain says Mark. 

Charlie Wildcard says LeVeon Bell lol"
Do we root for the Bills and Chiefs which helps the Ravens in the AFC North or root for the Steelers and Browns which help the Ravens with the overall AFC seedings (top seed)?
If you're not rooting against the Steelers then you are most likely an imposter among us.
Bills and Chiefs no question
"Worrying about seeding in week 1 is silly, it‚Äôs a long season. Always rooting against division rivals."
Chiefs and Bills of course
If you gotta this then you‚Äôre in the wrong sub
Bills and Chiefs
Is this really a question?
Bills and chiefs.
"Bills.

I like their fans."
"I'll root for chiefs and bills. Always against division rivals as their losses equal a step ahead towards the playoffs for us, in a round about way. That said Harbs is part of the Reid coaching tree and the bills are developing a pretty good football/fan culture up in orchard park."
Go Alex Collins!
These posts disgust me. In what world would you ever cheer for the steelers.
Bills and Chiefs. You want the Browns and Steelers to lose as much as possible
I don't think I've ever seen this question on week 1
Let's worry about the division first
Browns and steelers for betting purposes
Bills and browns. Why the browns you ask? Because they‚Äôll soften them up for us.
"Steelers and Browns, we re no rivals to suckers"

"I'm surprised Daelin Hayes was left out...
 
And Houston"
"I think we end up with a bunch of 3-5 sack guys on the team.  Not sure if a clear front runner jumps out.

Oweh just isn‚Äôt a good pass rusher yet as he has a lot of technique to learn. Bowser is great in coverage, so he doesn‚Äôt rush as much.  McPhee just lacks the burst to put up big sack numbers at this point.  Ferguson is not a very good player and didn‚Äôt even dress for games at the end of last year."
Honestly if preseason goes anything like the regular season it'll be Ferg and Queen competing this year
"Houston absolutely deserves to be on this list.

I hope Ravens fans temper expectations for Oweh. Kid has a lot of the physical attributes but he's still raw. I think he'll be a good player, but it might take longer than expected. This is not uncommon for pass rushers making the leap to the NFL. Shit, even guys like Za'Darius Smith and Matthew Judon needed a few seasons to marinate before they really came into their own."
Oweh
Tyus but next year I think it‚Äôll be Oweh.
"Looking at the Ravens season ending IRs,  JK Dobbins and LJ Fort are out. That should put players who have double initials as first names on high alert but, luckily, the Ravens don't have any more of those on the roster.

Marcus Peters and Gus Edwards injuries are bad news for players whose first name ends in -US. Tyus Bowser,  Ar'Darius Washington and Latavius Murray might be playing on borrowed time."
"More accurately it‚Äôs players like Ty‚ÄôSon Williams, Mark Andrews, Brandon Williams, Tyre Phillips, Brandon Stephens, as Gus and Marcus both have first name + s as their last name.  It‚Äôs far worse than you say."

"Congrats.  

Also, I respect the upgrade to the Gildan Softstyle‚Ä¶. Gildan Heavy Duty feels like you‚Äôre wearing insulation."
"Congratulations!

This reminds me of fun family story. My grandfather went to every Baltimore Colts game from the moment they started to the time they left, except for one game because of my uncles wedding.

He complained about it to the day he died: ‚ÄúDamn it Joe, there are 36 Sundays a year that don‚Äôt have a frickin football game.‚Äù"
"Congrats!

Try to always listen even when you don't want to, meaningfully apologize when you're in the wrong, avoid going to sleep angry at each other, and cherish every moment. It ain't easy. It can be a lot of work and growth at times, but it's worth it. Best of luck to you and your spouse, and may this be the happiest day of your life."

See if you can work in a ‚Äúfuck the Steelers‚Äù into the vows."

"I would‚Äôve started looking for replacements for you in your wedding last spring. Come on man, it‚Äôs opening day. 

It‚Äôs not too late to switch it to Tuesday."

I‚Äôve met some fans who would love to get married and watch the game at the party.

You almost had the official shirt of our RB corps : MRI & MRIs
Today's my birthday and your wedding. Congrats you two!
Congratulations! That‚Äôs awesome!

Enjoy!"

Congrats!
"What's worse, blown ACL before the start of the season or getting married?"
"My thoughts on the UDFA RB who is the last man standing from the backs the Ravens started camp with. He will get the starting job in week 1 and never relinquish it.  


My projections for Williams in 2021.  
Rushing - 1300  Yards with 10-12 TDs  
Receiving - 200-300 Yards 2-4 TDs  


Bell, Murray,   and Freeman will all back up Ty'Son and be used situationally all season. Ravens make the PlayOffs. Ty'Son makes the Pro Bowl."
1500-1800 total yards and 12-16 TDs‚Ä¶ I think your bar might be too low
"This is ... optimistic. Even with the extra game those numbers are high in the Ravens RB rotation model. Gus over the last three seasons averaged just over 700 yards, 5 ypc, 135ish carries, and 3 TDs. His last season was 129 of his 194 career receiving yards and 6 of his 10 rushing TDs.

Williams has zero snaps and was on a futures contract. He looked good against backups in games that didn't matter. I'm my opinion, he still has everything to prove and there's no reason to think he's going to be a stud, or better than Gus was last season.

Guess we'll see soon enough."
"I think that‚Äôs definitely possible but gonna be tough given how much we use all our running backs. I think Williams starts out strong but as others get acclimated to our system, he may not get as many snaps. 

But if he is absolutely balling, especially if he has a killer game in week 2 against KC, I could totally see him being the #1."
"Like just imagine, Ty'son balls out....and we have 3 starting-caliber RBs with him, Dobbins, and Gus next year üò≤"

"Primetime games are fun, but im always sad on sundays when i have to watch other teams all day"

"My wife's favorite team (Patriots) is playing today so i'm going to that game. I'm obviously a huge ravens fan, but it's gonna be so odd going to a game to a team I hated for years and years. 

I am so tempted to wear my ravens gear there üòÇ

Just wanted to know, for the people that have been there before, how is that stadium?"
"Hey there,

I am ALSO a Raven's fan who has been to Gillette. I went to a Ravens/Pats playoff game awhile back at their stadium. It's a Very Nice venue and the shopping/restuarant complex was also good too!

Btw, at this point wearing Ravens gear wont be too big a deal there. A few dirty looks and the like are what you'll probably get..."
"I have never had a bad time at a live sporting event (minus a few bad interactions), and every stadium has it‚Äôs charm, I am sure it will be a great time. Sometimes it is fun going to games where the Ravens aren‚Äôt playing because you have no stake in it, you can just root for a close game and enjoy the atmosphere and get loose. Have a good time!"
I brought my Steelers friend to the Ravens Rams game two years ago. He wore Steelers gear. It was annoying af
"I've worn my 52 jersey to a couple non-Raven NFL games. It drew the most ""attention"" walking around stadium: to/from seats, concessions, etc. I guess because like social media it's easy for a complete stranger to throw a quick verbal jab as they walk by knowing they'll never see the person again.

Also from 3 different games, it seems that the cheaper the seats, the more likely fans are to say anything about it (and only after a few beers). Also if they're winning you should be fine. If it starts to be an ugly loss, people tend to last out at anything.

Of course I was also wearing 52 which is a polarizing player for many non-Ravens fans. Have fun!"

"I know this is asked a million times, but either I'm dumb or cant find a straight answer lol.

My wife is getting me a streaming service for my birthday on wednesday so I can watch live football games on the tv and my phone _legally_.

Is fubo worth it? Can I watch all the games including monday and sunday night with that?

Or does game pass work? I'm not looking to getting a VPN either.

Thanks!


Edit: I appreciate all the help guys, I think I might just tell my wife that there really isnt a good option for our circumstances and to save the money! Guess it's a life on the salty seas for me.

Thanks a ton!"
"I‚Äôve talked about this on this sub with someone else before, so I‚Äôll just copy and paste what I told them:


If you live in the Baltimore or DC media market, you can download the NFL or yahoo sports app. They‚Äôve been putting the locally-broadcasted games on there for free for a few years now.

If not, you can use Locast (a free local television website) along with a geolocation changer to trick your computer into thinking you live in Baltimore and allowing you to watch the game online completely free and legally

Just a fair warning though. Locast has unskippable ads that play about every 15 minutes, so if you‚Äôre using it to watch football it may unexpectedly interrupt plays. To get rid of ads, you have to pay a $5 per month subscription to Locast. Since the regular season is only 4 months though, this still ends up being an extremely cheap and reliable way to watch the Ravens"
Im pretty sure the only way to be able to watch every game is sunday ticket
"I know you said legally, but Nflbite.com is great. No VPN required. Just gotta get past the pop ups lol. I use that for the Ravens games. 

My actual streaming service is sling. I use that because it‚Äôs cheaper than cable and I am able to get espn, nfl network and redzone."
Reddit football streams
"DAZN (da-zone‚Ä¶.stupid name) is expensive, but being able to watch every game, and go back to the ones I‚Äôve missed is super worth it. They have RedZone and other NFL programming too!"
"Hello Ravens fans! I'm a casual Ravens fan (FTS) that lurks here frequently but an avid fantasy footballer. I've got a quick question about what you guys think the Ravens Gameplan will be tomorrow. Hope you can oblige!

Related to the recent running back injuries, how do you expect the offense to flow tomorrow? Will we see the Ravens passing a little more than what we'd typically expect? Or, will they stay dedicated to the run game with Williams and Lamar? I don't think anyone would dispute that Williams will get a RB1 work load, but part of me thinks we may see a lot of Watkins on Monday because of the RB injuries. To my knowledge, there's nobody behind him that has a full grasp of the playbook, so the snaps spelling Williams will have to go somewhere."
Just win baby.
"I think it was gonna be very Lamar 2019-esque anyway. The Raiders D is bad, and Gus Bradley is the cover 3/four man rush type. They air it out as long as everyone is comfy with it."
"It comes down to two things.

Kicking ass and taking names."
"I‚Äôm no expert, but I think its to score more points than the raiders"
"Nice try, Jon"

I‚Äôm in a 12 man PPR league and I‚Äôm trying to decide who to start at my flex position. Just wondered what the fanbase thought about who is going to have the bigger game tomorrow. Go Ravens!
Ty‚Äôson.  He will get the bulk of the RB carries this week.  Like he‚Äôs the only RB that knows the system.
I‚Äôd go with Ty‚ÄôSon. I expect him to get 12-15 carries and probably around 75 yards. I‚Äôm starting him in my league.
Williams will touch the ball more
Holly
Williams for week 1 imo

"Every year I take too much stock in week 1. That‚Äôs why we play the games. So yea I‚Äôm a little freakin out about the browns, but it‚Äôs a looooonnnggg season. (Literally longest ever). So just gotta have faith in the purple"
Jeudy's ankle went to heaven
Tyran and Frank will magically be healthy next week against us lol
Is Rodgers gonna go out with a whimper?
z just got fucking robbed by the refs
"Well I've never experienced a week 1 as bad as this without the Ravens even playing yet... Ever. It's unreal, heartbreaking injuries followed by the rest of the AFCN going 3-0 against good competition"
Finally one of those happens
Brown tied his career high in pressures allowed
Lol baker
THANK YOU HUGHES
Ingram coming up with a TD.
These Arizona plays just make me wonder how Lamar would do if he had a receiver the caliber of Nuk Hopkins. Man is insane
I like allen... I just wonder if he'll be criticized for these passes.
Why are the AFCN teams winning
Watching Russ and Kyler get bailed out on consecutive plays by unreal WR play makes me feel for Lamar
"Allen is looking bad.

Three overthrown passes and two were shoe in TDs. 2 errant screens, and bad pocket presence so far.

Ben looks cooked, and Steelers OL is piss poor. Their D will get them to 8 wins at least.

Titans getting spanked on O and D is pure bliss"
"Well, looks like TJ Watt is showing why he just got $122 mil..."
burrow finally found chase for a catch lol
jared goofball in midseason form
The amount of penalties in this bills game
"Rookie WRs making some plays, makes me sad we're missing our guy"
Fuck the Titans
I think the ravens broke the titans run game
"finally bills

jesus fuck"
So once the chiefs blow the browns out. We will be 1st place assuming the vikings come back before playing a game lol
"odell out

and tyrann"
TikTok just got blown the fuck up AGAIN
"tuddy cardinals

beauty from kyler"
AZ interception!! Fuck the Titans!
Goddammit Buffalo
what the fuck was that
Titans D looking pathetic af lol
Tyrod cooking rn üî•üò≠ . Imagine if he has a mvp type season in Houston
FIVE SACKS FOR JONES
Herbert is a scary dude. His throws are so gorgeous
that's game
Cleveland strikes first
goddamit vikings
Frank Clark being out for KC is enormous for the Browns and Ravens. They‚Äôre gonna get smoked in the run game.
That was a great effort by CEH
"Holy shit

Browns player shoved a coach and KC got the penalty

The fuck????"
"We‚Äôre struggling bad, trailing 10-0."
This is the type of shit that makes you hate football
"Uhhhh KC

You wanna maybe‚Ä¶.dominate like usual?"
I‚Äôm speechless ‚Ä¶.what is this I am seeing
"Browns fans, ""We are beating the chiefs by 12 in the second quarter.""

So what you're saying is the game is tied if not Browns losing."
The Brown's defense regrettably looks formidable.
My dumb ass picked up Saquon Barkley and Melvin Gordon in fantasy. The Broncos and Giants both look so bad and it's extremely boring to watch. At least I got Lamar and MAndrews going tomorrow.
There is no Defense being played in this game lol
I don't understand why Tim Patrick is good now
Damn I was expecting Rodgers to come out on fire
"I‚Äôm convinced Tony Romo is from the future. As soon as he says something, it happens"
It makes me sick that the damn Patriots got Mac Jones at 15. Looks like a steal.
wow chiefs are unbelievable
Jordan love has his first completion to A. Rodgers.
Mahomes and steph curry got the same disease where they look 15 years old the rest of their life
The brownies lost but damn they looked good first half.... scary
"Things I loved:

Steelers & Titans playing terrible

Big Ben playing horrendous ( I hate this man so much)

The Bills looking a hot mess

Tyrod Taylor have a good game. I am not a Houston fan obviously but good for him

Kyler Murray & D-Hop playing like crazy so fun to watch

Andy Dalton being Andy Dalton & and the Jaguars being the Jaguars

&#x200B;

Things I hated:

Tom Brady & The Bucs I am so sick of them. Seriously the day him and Gronk are off my damn screen will be a blessing.

The fact that we are gunna be missing so many of our guys with all these injuries :(

Rams looking potentially dangerous. Was hoping it would take Stafford time to adjust. Clearly he is doing just fine..."
List of streams for our game against the Raiders if anyone needs https://nflstreamsliven.blogspot.com/2021/09/las-vegas-raiders-vs-baltimore-ravens.html
Fuck this piece of shit opening day
Ref bailout for noodle arm ben
Steelers  up
Why do I have this strange premonition that tomorrow night will be an upset? All these analysts and their stupid articles are getting to me! WEEK 1 jitters suck
"Burrow looks good idk if it‚Äôs just against the vikes but eh either way. Steelers look like shit, I‚Äôd be surprised it they win more than 5 games this year. Titans getting routed by the Cards. It‚Äôs a good day.

-edit- Also, Tyrod SZN."
"Steelers getting bailed out by the refs, fuck off. FUCK THE STEELERS"
Murray might be the mvp this season. Already 5tds my goodness
Let's go Chiefs.  Hope the Browns lose big.
I'm watching browns at chiefs and browns look scary.
"Drive down and get 3 for scorigami
Pleaseigami"
come on kirk
"I'm switching between Steelers-Bills and Seahawks-Colts to avoid commercials. Browns-Chiefs later on. Hate this waiting around to watch the Ravens, but thankfully only two MNFs for us this year (other one is the Colts)."

I only get the eagles and Washington. Guess I'm watching Washington :(
damn Tyrod and Ingram both with TDs on Jacksonville
Dropson is hurt.

thielen tuddy on 4th down
8yrds for Henry. 8 fucking yards lmfao!!!
Is Minnesota trash or do we need to be concerned about Cincinnati now?
zach wilson finally allowed to play the game

If browns win were officially fucked in this division with our injuries
Stefanski looks like a pedo
Ha! The midget Baker! He is not 1/10 of the player Mahomes is (or Lamar).
Chandler Jones bout to walk into Cardinals front office with a blank check at this point right now...love to see it against Tenn.
"I understand we all hate the browns but that whole situation was bullshit, Harrison tripped and then gets pushed by a coach. He obviously shouldn‚Äôt have retaliated but that coach should have at least got ejected as well."

Watching the game? Got a comment?
Shocker: Steelers Oline is horrible.
"Despite the score, the Bills line is giving Allen tons of time. Their offense looks improved. 

Pittsburgh looks the same to me so far‚Ä¶"
"Both Josh and Ben looking pretty pedestrian. Lots of holding calls, lots of dropped balls. Game is still 3-0"
Color commentary is pretty weak. Not a fan of Charles Davis. Doesn‚Äôt really add much besides recap of play by play and speculation. Nothing technical.
Forgot how much I enjoy seeing the Steelers fuck up. Josh Allen is nice with it
"I‚Äôm woefully unimpressed by Buffalo, can‚Äôt believe they beat us last year. They are entirely 1 dimensional. 

Pittsburgh looks about the same to me. Have no line whatsoever."
"I can't tell if the Steelers D is doing well or if Allen is just shaking off the rust, they should be up 24-0 right now but the dude keeps missing his guys wide open down field"
Ben looks awful
Steelers defensive line is killing the Bills OL and the Steelers OL sucks both in general.  This is going to be a low scoring game.
Not a Squeeler fan but their D looks scary
"Man that Bills offensive line is terrible. 4 man rush every play, crazy pressure every play."
My only comment is fuck the Bills. They played like shit and made some very shit decisions.
Ben‚Äôs arm seems to be as weak as last year. That‚Äôs good news for us‚Ä¶
"Yeah, Bills need to stop going for these flashy plays at 3rd and 1 and just focus on getting the first
Down"
Ben looks old.
"54 total yards for the whole first half makes me smile.

Fuck the Steelers"
Fuck the Steelers
Steelers blackout hats look like it's a big yellow zero.
Lol josh Allen‚Äôs scrambles are so weak compared to Lamar!!!
"Typical team playing the Steelers, make stupid decisions and let them back in.  It is like teams play them to lose."
why the fuck you over throwing deep all game when you got this
Allen looks like dirt. Need to give him that same energy they give Lamar when he struggles
Najee Harris is really proving pff wrong when they ranked him 20th coming into this year.
Bills need to quit screwing around and put this game away. Vikings letting Bungles run all over them. We don't need PIT and CIN both starting out 1-0.
Are the Bills going to blow this game?
allen gonna get hurt running like that all game /s
I'm not going another year with Pitt winning games like this ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Bills o line is struggling against Pittsburgh. Steelers D tough or Bills line sus?
"wow

who could have guessed the steelers offense would be shit with no line and ben returning"
Someone get that clip of Juju getting fucking destroyed
Plays like that make me appreciate John's ability to draw up trick plays ü§£
bills lost right there
I hate watching the Steelers play because it‚Äôs literally just Ben trying to play hero ball
Ben isn‚Äôt very nimble
Heeeeey there's Eric EButterfingers I didn't think he was still there
Josh Allen is playing like he‚Äôs been reading all the stories about his big arm; he‚Äôs trying to constantly showcase it.
I can‚Äôt get into this game. I‚Äôm not seeing anything spectacular besides Juju getting blown up
Bills better put it together. I have them in my suicide pool!
Fuck the bills and their fans
Huge play by that juiced up Watt brother‚Ä¶
Wow what a catch by Claypool!!
Wow Washington really is where QBs go to die
They should feed Najee. Boy is gonna be depressed if Ben keeps trying to air it out all the time.
Have any season ticket holders tried to watch Redzone in the NFL app with their season ticket holder account connected?  I've never had an issue doing this for the last few seasons but today it's not working.  I got the email saying that Redzone is again included this year for season ticket holders so not sure what's going on.  I signed out and back in and then reinstalled the app but nothing is working.
Same issue here. Glad to know it‚Äôs not just me.
NFL Fantasy isn't working either. Seems they're having issues with their servers.
I'm having the same problem. I'm a new season ticket holder so I thought I wasn't doing something right.
I put a support ticket in earlier and they replied back just now that they're aware of and working on the issue.
"Glad its not just me, my irate rage has been tempered only slightly."
Same issue for me as well. Hopefully they release an app update soon to fix this
Me too. They should compensate us by finally allowing us to cast it this year. Which is already bull shit that we can‚Äôt considering we pay for season tickets.
Same thing here
Got email from NFL today asking about their service for my problem.  Had to laugh as I‚Äôve received nothing saying if it‚Äôs been fixed or not.  Suggested they have a Redzone preseason to determine who in their IT department to cut or keep.
Does anyone know how to tell if the app is fixed? All I see is the ability to still purchase it in the NFL app but I should have it since my season ticket account is linked. I‚Äôm curious what it would look like in the app if it was working.
Same problem here. Still can‚Äôt get it
So Sunday at 10am PST we all get furious again?
This is bullshit
"Falcons season ticket holder checking in here, any luck from anybody? I‚Äôve updated and relinked my account multiple times and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve got it to work‚Ä¶"
Not working today for me either (Texans STM)‚Ä¶ frustrating. I‚Äôve done everything I possibly can. If someone figures it out let us know.
Titans STM here. Can't figure it out either. I also have my YTTV account connected to the app but not sure if that does anything.
Is everyone here on iOS?

Same issue here with Raiders season ticket account. 2nd week in a row.
49ers STM here. Still hasn‚Äôt worked for me either. Had to start a trial from Hulu just to watch redzone. Hopefully this gets fixed by next week.
Still not working...
"I got an email from the NFL this morning saying this should be fixed.  Remove app, reinstall, and link season ticket account.  We'll see in a few hours."
"I received the following update to my service request this morning. Hopefully it works:  
  
Hello. We have an update on your RedZone season ticket access  
  
We believe this issue has been resolved.  
  
Please delete and download the app to make sure you are on the most up-to-date version (56.1.2.) Once the new app is downloaded, connect your season tickets. Once the first slate of games starts you should see RedZone in the NFL app.  
  
We thank you for your patience."
NFL Redzone finally working for me as a Chicago Bears season ticket holder!
It works now!
Yay. Working for Carolina STH too.
Texans STM working finally and without being connected to my tv subscriber.
"Colts STM here, is everyone able to get access to redzone and gamepass now ? I‚Äôm still having trouble gettting connected. Iv linked my Ticketmaster account and my NFL account, but it‚Äôs still requesting that I pay and everything is locked."
Chargers STM and still having issues connecting as well. Will try when the games start
I was just told by the Giants that I have to be in stadium and connected to their Wi-Fi in order to enjoy this benefit. I cannot imagine how it is a benefit if I am there in the stadium to watch a live game.

Titans are horrible the texans look like the best team in their division rn
"Marcus Peters is proud. They're getting stomped out good and proper, Chandler Jones with a GOAT esque performance. 

Julio chose the wrong team."
Chandler Jones is their daddy
Josh Allen MVP candidate? LMAO
Lmfao bills getting stomped. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the Steelers but the bills looking more and more like a fluke team
I could be off but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just a one week thing ‚Äî they lost their OC didn‚Äôt they? We of all teams know how much that can affect things.
"""Unstoppable offense"" is all they were described in the off-season."
I was told they fixed there defense lol.
"Also, in other news, Josh Allen overrated af"
"It was pure gold, i wish i could bottle that feeling because holy fuck were they atrocious on every front & facet imaginable. The Oline was laughably bad, mind you AZ defense is much improved this season but still..i literally burst out laughing at some of the lack of heart and hustle from almost every player after the 1st half. These guys talk so much & have done absolutely nothing in decades. 

I cant wait to watch them play ""defense"" next week lmao!!!!! Russ gonna pick those boys apart on the edge with their 10 yard cushions everytime!

Titans are ass yall!"
Fuck the Titans.
The best thing so far today.
"Love to see them lose, but I'm not judging anything based on Week 1."
"Hell yes.

Fuck the Steelers."
"I respect the Steelers.  I feel pity for the Bengals and am glad to see their future looking bright.  Fuck the Titans.  Fuck the Bills.  Fuck the Chiefs.

Edit: first and foremost, fuck those smug ass Browns."
"I literally can't stand the sight of Mike Vrabel and we all know he thinks the Titans are tougher than the Ravens, so today's smackdown by the Cardinals was my favorite game of the day. !!!k"

Comments and observations
"Regardless of AFC record implications, if the Browns win - just imagine how insufferable their fanbase is going to be about it. They're already obnoxiously cocky about the hype for this season.

I live in OH. I won't be able to leave the house."
Jesus Christ the chiefs have the worst defense in the league at the moment
Landry is so punchable
Stat that commercial with Dobbins is going to get depressing after the millionth time it's aired by next week
Stay classy browns
"How'd the refs miss Harrison shoving the Chiefs coach

The Chiefs coach should be ejected too for shoving Harrison"
If the browns win this I'm going to cry myself to sleep
Lol I see Aaron Rodgers last Dance canceled after season premiere.
Baker moving the ball well apparently
Of course KC will shit the bed week one but then come out guns blazing next week
The camera effects are crazy com8ng back from commercial. The iso focus with blurred background. Looks like a video game.
Maybe the Super Bowl loser curse is real
Catching the Dophins/Pats game looks like a lot of empty seats in Foxboro
Arrowhead is BUMPING
Stepping on a down player and shoving a coach. Stay classy Cleveland.
"They should eject the chiefs coach too for pushing the browns player, right?"
Note for next week..cover Tyreek Hill
"This just in:

# THE BROWNS STILL SUCK!"
"Was it really am incredible game for baker? Sure he was efficient, but what's the point of empty yards if you throw 0 tds and pick when the team needs you most?"
Browns gonna brown
Browns players being trash already. What a horric act by Harrison!
Its all set up for us to lose this week : / just feels like it
THEY CALLED THAT ON KANSAS CITY?
Browns looking good for real.
Chiefs defense playing like Swiss cheese rn
Sad to see Orlando playing for kc‚Ä¶
CBS got two good late games. FoX got trash
Baker pounding the field after the pic should be a meme
BAKER BAKER TURNOVER MAKER
Great game!
Orlando Brown was a rotating turnstile. I know he was going against Myles Garrett but give me Stanley any day of the week
The browns are looking better than we ever have against the chiefs and it‚Äôs cause they have an OC that knows how to call a pass game
"Props to Cleveland OC, calling plays that are working."
I want the chiefs to win so they're less vengeful week 2 lol
Browns are falling apart. Gah damn!
Lol. Probably still could have gotten it off if he tried too.
Holy cow browns!
This is probably gonna be one of those 52-51 games since Defense isn't happening for either team. Especially if the Browns are just going to go for 2
Browns pass defense and defense overall looks awful
Holy crap big pass from mayfield. Dude was not even covered!!!
I got the over
Holy crap if the browns score again before half time. Did not want to have to sweat them this season. Maybe they‚Äôll turn into old browns in the 2nd half?
"Interesting to see how well we play Waller this week, cause it‚Äôs a step up next week with Kelce. Do not want Kelce to bury us."
"Lol if not only do Chiefs come back to win, but cover (they need a FG)"
How is Ward never getting called for DPI on Tyreek?
"At the end of the day,  Browns be browns."
There was some clown last week in a thread I can‚Äôt find saying Tanenhill is Elite üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ omg that fucker is stupid
Yea typical browns hater talking shit because their brains can't possible entertain the thought that the browns are a top team now. Probly a Pittsburgh ass eater that lives in Ohio.
The browns arent actually good? Right?
And here come the Chiefs‚Ä¶ uf.
Good stop by the browns on 3rd and long.

No excuse from me. Bills played like trash. The o-line got exposed a little. Bills never could handle physical teams. Josh was erratic all game.
If we somehow lose tomorrow we‚Äôre already going to be getting bashed by everyone. But tomorrow Josh Allen ain‚Äôt going to get bashed everyone‚Äôs going to say it‚Äôs only week 1.. smh
"I moved from BMore back to my high school town in BillsMafia territory. Everyone i work with is a Bills fan. They all know I'm a Ravens fan... debating how to play this tomrw... when we haven't played yet. All this hype over Josh really irks me. I think Lamar is better. I'll just wear my Lamar jersey tomrw, abs not day a word..."
"I do agree Lamar gets treated way more harshly than Josh, but I just wish this example could be with a different QB.

I like Josh and the Bills too much."
It's just weird how Lamar Jackson is treated like a fluke and Josh Allen is treated like the next elite quarterback. Neither player deserves that treatment.
Honestly who gives a shit
It should be less about Josh than it is the media.
"He's Joe 2.0

And just so we're clear I've always been a huge Joe Flacco support. 

He's better than average"
"Egh, no hate for Allen or the Bills and their fans. He deserves the credit he got and he‚Äôs not responsible for the jerkoffs who hold Lamar to higher standards for reasons we all know."
If Lamar was in his place he‚Äôd get bashed nonstop despite having an MVP
"Morons! Always propping up this kid. What has he really done other than throwing the ball in Diggs' vicinity last year? Diggs is the Buffalo Bills. He was last year and will be this year too. If he regresses, Allen is back to being a 50% passer."
This reaction is embarrassing. So sensitive over stupid shit.
The media calling that Steelers Def elite is a fucking stretch. The Bills gave away that win
"I am a Lamar fan and have probably been a fan of this team longer than 80% of the people on here, but why is it that if you guys don‚Äôt hear the media praise Lamar at least three times a day, then you slip into fetal position and forget how to function?

Nobody can give a good reason for hating Josh Allen other than the fact that the media speaks highly of him and he gets compared to Lamar. Does everyone forget how much positive attention Lamar got in 2019 and 2020? He slipped up a bit in 2020 whereas Allen excelled, so yeah, Allen is going to get some attention.

Haven‚Äôt even played a single regular season game yet and everyone is already crying about Lamar not getting any attention."
"I'll give you one: It's one game. Lamar's had bad games. Everyone (except maybe Mahomes) has bad games.

Edit: Holy shit. Y'all really upset I'm not getting out my pitchfork?"
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"Can we stop this chip on our shoulder nonsense every time Baker, Allen, or Mahomes has a bad game? Just because the media is unfair on Lamar doesn't mean we have to project outrage onto other teams."
‚ÄúThis is the year the League figures out Josh Allen.‚Äù

This isnt an overreaction at all. With all our injuries and them getting healthy they're probably the best team in the AFC North.
Anyone who thought they wouldn‚Äôt be good was smoking some purple colored crack
"They were due. Everyone has their time eventually. Even the browns. We just gotta get in the playoffs, and anything can happen"
"If you aren't afraid of the Browns, you haven't been paying attention."
"They are a good team. It's possible to root against them but also realize they are one of the top teams now. I feel like a lot of people are so desperate to say ""same old Browns"" and make fun of them, but that's just setting yourself up for disappointment, most likely."
If anyone thinks it's LOLBrowns this year I'm not sure what team you've been watching the last year. They're gonna be tough to beat this season.. I'm worried they might sweep up with the way the schedule is set up
"Alternatively, have you considered this? Fuck the Browns. Can't wait to see them Browns it up and find a way to suck this year."
Not an overreaction. For the Steelers or Browns. Offenses look improved and Good luck to any team blocking the combinations of Clowney and Garret/Watt and Ingram.
It‚Äôs been justified for over a year
"The Steelers and Bengals already won, and the Browns look well on their way. Two of those wins would come on the road against the two teams everyone has pegged coming out of the AFC, Bills and Chiefs. Absolute nightmare start to the season for Baltimore."
Steelers were 11-0 last year.  Just sayin'.
Browns are good we can‚Äôt be holding onto the past no more fellas. Baker really boutta beat Mahomes before Lamar wow.
This post got kinda funny over the last few minutes.
"This looked exactly like last year‚Äôs Browns to me.  Above average offense when balanced, great run game can take the sails out of opponent‚Äôs by burning clock, yet give up unconscionable TDs in the deep secondary repeatedly and make bonehead penalties‚Ä¶ and thus consistently play close games.  

They‚Äôre the most volatile team in the league in many ways because they‚Äôre good enough to win 80% of the games they walk onto the field for, but seem to win about 60% instead"
They'll fuck it up. They always do
The team I respect. The fans act like Eddie Murphy in trading places. But I will forever root against them.
That‚Äôs what happens when you put the ball in bakers hands with the game on the line
Ha ha! Cleveland remains Cleveland. A cess pool for fans and teams alike.

"Can we not, it would be different if they were a rival or a team that didn't absolutely destroy us last season"
Damn that‚Äôs cold lol
I get this reference dot jaypeg
Probably a good thing we traded him
"He was bailed out a lot last year by Lamar, he allowed a pressure a game, on a mobile qb, when Stanley allowed 1 all season. It was a steal of a trade honestly, but I love him as a RT and a person so I wish him the best"
Judon wasn‚Äôt great today either
Lamar helped him so much because you couldn‚Äôt just pass rush Lamar like a normal pass rusher.
Proof that he‚Äôs not a fucking left tackle üòÇ
He‚Äôs missing assignments and The result is Garrett is in the Chiefs backfield untouched . Not a good first half for him.
Anyone else notice that the broadcast denoted him as a rookie at the start of the game? Seemed almost like a weird omen haha.
"damn, just hate to see it ü§≠"
Hes going against Myles Garrett lmao
Guys I hear ya but it‚Äôs only one game.
He just got beat around the edge by Garrett
I mean he‚Äôs coming from a run first offense it‚Äôs gonna take him time to adjust
"Guys, be better. Appreciate what he did for us, no need to shit on him for having a bad game. Focus more on how awesome our old boys Tyrod and Ingram looked instead. We are better than this."
Lmao just allowed a key sack. He really is ass
Yeah but its not like Bateman balled out today either....
"He was always going to be ass protecting on the left side. On the right side and as a run blocker for the Ravens, not so much."
"He has always had trouble with the speed rush, it will be Gloria this season with KC who throw a lot."
CBS listed him as a rookie in the lineup!
"ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è oh well, so sad. I‚Äôm happy with the draft picks"

"Bills, Steelers, Chiefs and Browns all look very legit.  Gonna be tough sledding.  Team needs to come together.  Coaching needs to really execute well.  Gonna be very challenging and exciting."
"""Hold onto your butts"""
"Did you see the Bills Steelers game?

Though it‚Äôs unfair to make any real assessments after 1 week."
The Browns have the best offensive line in the league. Chubb isn't touched at the LOS and Baker has all day to throw. They're going to be tough to beat.
"AFC has way better teams 

All 4 NFC West teams could make the playoffs because as a whole the rest of the NFC sucks outside TB"
Steelers had some dogshit offense. Their D saved that game for them completely.
"Bengals play a solid game today as well. Zach Wilson impressed me, I think his team really let him down today. Decent day of football. Excited to watch Matt Stafford lead Rams"
"Bills didn‚Äôt look legit today.  Josh Allen‚Äôs deep ball accuracy was bad and his downfield ball‚Äôs while in the vicinity of the WRs were poorly placed.  Honestly the Chiefs, Browns and Steelers look scary but the Bills absolutely do not like a mediocre defense with a mediocre OL and a QB that‚Äôs seemingly regressed from being elite that‚Äôs a playoff team given there weapons but it‚Äôs a first round exit."
Gotta admit Chubb and Hunt are studs. Lost count of how many broken tackles. You can credit Chiefs for bad tackling but great running backs have a knack for causing bad tackles.
Idk I mean Ben looked pretty old today lol
The browns look legit man
Bills dont look that legit lmao. Browns look the most improved and impressive for sure
"I expect Ben and the Steelers to be good early but regress late like they did last year. Bills should get their shit together, they have great players and a great coaching staff. Browns have a loaded roster but I don‚Äôt believe Baker is an elite qb. Chiefs are still a heavy favorite imo. Us, Colts, Dolphins, and Chargers should be teams to watch down the line as well. I feel like the Titans are going to regress this year with the OC change"
"Steelers are a paper tiger. Their defense is good but captain fatfuck on offense doesnt worry me. Bills called an absolutely stupid game. Chiefs, Browns, yes for sure, very worried."
"Idk what Bills Steelers game you watched. They both had glaring weaknesses especially the Bills. The Steelers have an elite defense as we expected but the offense was dogshit. The Chiefs are the Chiefs, 3rd quarter explosion and all. The Browns look really good. I think we fit somewhere in with the Chiefs and Browns, assuming injuries don't fuck us over too hard"
Watch put for Chargers as well. Herbert is scary good
My takeaway was that the bills and Steelers offense were booty
""
"Start with ""can tavon young stay healthy""?"
"it‚Äôs been so long since he‚Äôs been healthy i honesty forgot how good he was. He def was solid in the slot, hasn‚Äôt had much chance to take a step in being elite. he hasn‚Äôt played in the regular season for like two years now so it‚Äôs hard to tell where he‚Äôs at right now"
Imo he‚Äôs never been healthy long enough to even get a gauge of that tbh üòÇ
"By elite do you mean like a top 5 or 10 CB?

If so then no."
"He's a playmaker without a doubt, maybe he's just been lucky but sometimes I'd rather have someone lucky than good. For playing less than 1500 defensive snaps, 7 turnovers and 2 TDs is elite in my book. Only problem is staying healthy is a skill and he doesn't have that"
Yes. Can be one of the best slot corners
Yes but his play style isn‚Äôt conducive to staying healthy at his size.
If Tavon can stay healthy I could easily see him as a top 10 cb in the league.

The browns are legitimately good. Sucks for them that they could‚Äôve beaten the chiefs but I‚Äôm not mad about it
Well they‚Äôre playing the Chiefs and I thought they played a good game and had a shot to win the game. I hate them though

How is this a question? We need to win the division for the chiefs record to impact us.
Chiefs 100%

Well we are in one of the toughest divisions in football that isn‚Äôt anything close to a guaranteed division title for anyone. We need the Browns and Steelers to lose as much as possible and hopefully we don‚Äôt look right past them like this post seems to be doing.

"Quietly, I cannot express this enough"
They're in a one possession game against the defending AFC Champs in their house. It's not like they're getting blown out by the New York Jets. I'd be thrilled if we put up just as good of a fight vs KC next week.
I thought Cleveland was one mistake away from winning.  I‚Äôm not laughing.  I‚Äôm shit scared.

"It's really amazing to me that they lost. The Chiefs had no answers for their offense in the 1st half, it really seemed like the Browns would score a TD on every drive.

Reminds me of our playoff loss to the Pats when we had a 2 TD lead twice. Just mind blowing."
It is an adjective used just before the word 'poop'.
"Personally I kinda think wins are a bad way to evaluate a qb, but they do matter to some extent. That pick was a bad decision by Baker. Idk if he was trying to throw it to the wr or he was trying to throw it out of bounds. He had a solid game overall though. Mahomes being Mahomes and immediately scoring really changed the game."

Orlando on the ravens >>> Orlando on the chiefs
"Got to say, I liked Orlando but Lamar made him rich don‚Äôt think for a second he didn‚Äôt"
Mahomes is doing Orlando no favors by dropping so deep into the pocket. It's a nightmare scenario especially when you're facing off against an extremely athletic Myles Garrett.
Lamar carried this man
There's no way he allowed ONLY 5
The scheme and Lamar benefits any OLmen who come here.

"We should be wishing well for our guys after they leave us, except for when they're playing us"
"I hope to God that the ravens continue to follow this model

Trade guys whose values are inflated due to the system(like brown) unless they are actual elite talents in their own right.

Retain our own unique players that would be under valued by the rest of the league with mid tier deals(Gus, Boyle, Ricard, etc)


For long term planning when they recognize that they have a player that the rest of the league might over pay for they need to invest resources in developing a quality backup.

That's how they can continue to build an elite roster even after Jackson is off of his rookie contract"
"Orlando isn‚Äôt a ELITE Left Tackle, but he‚Äôs above average Left Tackle which what makes him elite playing Right Tackle. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll ever replicate that success he had with the Ravens because he‚Äôs not aware of what he really is."

All I gotta say is we haven‚Äôt even played a down yet and we‚Äôre talking mad shit. Let‚Äôs worry about ourselves for now
I'd be down for upvote parties when we win a game. Celebrating the loss of another team against an opponent that we couldnt beat ourselves is just embarrassing.
"Maybe this is an unpopular take, but upvote parties in general are dumb. I‚Äôm all for celebrating the team we all love, but upvote parties are lazy karma farms that add nothing to the conversation. Upvote parties regarding other teams are even worse."
Upvote parties are Reddit at its worst. No I will not help you farm karma because some team lost.
"If we have to have upvote parties, it should be reserved for accomplishments such as making the playoffs, winning the division, etc. doing it for week 1 losses for other teams is incredibly dumb. Like so dumb that words can‚Äôt even describe how dumb it is."
I think its childish but that's who took over this sub so here we are
"I have mixed feelings. On one hand, it‚Äôs cathartic to celebrate a hated team‚Äôs loss. On the other hand, it does make us look lame as shit and it‚Äôs mildly embarassing"
"It's fun when it's justified.

Most of the time I think they are just low effort karma farms.

Apparently we've moved on from even having upvote parties with a picture as if it wasn't already bad enough."
Its week 1. I wouldnt be worried about any team other than the weeks opponent.
"Pleasanty surprised the second option had that many votes.

I'm pretty sure this sub talks about other team's more than other of the other subs and it's mad cringey. It's one thing to celebrate and laugh at a rival losing but making an entire thread for it is pathetic.

This wouldn't be a problem if this sub had better moderation, way too much bullshit posts allowed here."
Every sub does it. I don‚Äôt care for it but I general it doesn‚Äôt bother me
"It's not ok unless that team is named the Browns, Steelers, or Titans."
really couldn‚Äôt care less what anyone posts. it‚Äôs not hard to swipe a finger a centimeter and skip over it. also expecting an entire fan base to agree on something is asinine.
"People who care about ""how our sub looks"" are like kids or something. It's an anonymous online platform who gives a shit? Give these losers all the ridicule they deserve"
"If it's the Steelers or that Florida team that the league has the fix in for, fair."

"Yea for the most part, I think a lot of teams are still rusty. A lot of starters didn‚Äôt get much playing time in preseason and it shows for some teams. Some teams looked like they were still in Preseason Week 4 mode.  Now if Buffalo still looks as bad as they did yesterday around Week 4 or 5‚Ä¶then yea‚Ä¶that may mean something"
He's not bad for a running back.
People saying the steelers figured out Josh Allen are ignoring the part where Josh Allen looked terrible. He overthrew a bunch of open receivers and was inaccurate on a bunch of 5-10 yard routes. He didn't look good.

Was that the illusive man‚Ä¶

Just when I thought Mandrews couldn't get hotter
"Carr looks like such a slappy in that pic ü§£
Let‚Äôs roll"
"Ravens football is back! And so I will be back with another season of crappy photoshops for each weekly matchup. As always, if you have any suggestions or requests, please let me know. LET'S GO RAVENS!"
"I was waiting for the Week 1 Hype video from the Ravens official accounts, before realizing they probably had to completely re-do it after heavily featuring Gus as a step-up moment."
The fact that you were able to fit his chest piece in there lmao well done
Andrews we with the flow tho!
I missed these so much over the offseason!!
"Gruden's expression as the SS dude is killing me haha

Great work!"
Wow this is awesome. Nice work!
This is hilarious and wonderful
Ok. That's funny. Especially Harbaugh.
"We all know Gruden loves that damn play. A few years ago, when he was in the booth, his brother had the WFT run a fullback pass on 4th-and-short against the Cowboys. He lit up like he was opening a Christmas present. So I'm watching for two things tonight: 

1. When the Ravens face 3rd-and-short, especially inside the 20, I expect to see Ricard catch a simple bootleg pass off of play-action that's made to look like Power 
2. When the Raiders face 3rd-and-short, I expect to see our pass rush let the FB out into the flat, and our safeties to come crashing down and maybe even jump the route.   

No excuse not to be prepared to stop this play, and every excuse to have it in the playbook."
"The Ravens knowing about this play would be the perfect reason not to run it, which means the Ravens won't have to worry about it, which means the raiders will definitely run it, which means the Ravens will be ready.

&#x200B;

Checkmate Gruden."
Carr just better not throw to the backside Venus or Gruden may have a stroke on the sideline
"Richard is on IR, it‚Äôll be the fullback Ingold or TE2 Moreau."

45-17 ravens
My house cleaner is a raiders fan. He just came in talking a lot of shit for a guy who predicted a 13-7 score.
"I think it‚Äôs going to be a lot closer than people expect, and I‚Äôm kind of worried"
"I predicted for Fantasy purposes the Defense to score 12, Tucker 10, and Andrew‚Äôs 15. So I‚Äôm going 34-14"
"31-17 Ravens

Annoyingly close game and we are sweating at 24-17 in the 4th, but we march down the field and lock in the W with another TD at the end."
"Idk how you guys are saying things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not close‚Äù as if we‚Äôre NOT limping into this game with 4 season-ending injuries & a wiped out backfield lol. Not to mention injuries to Watkins & Bateman. 

Im thinking 27-20 Ravens. I think this will be a close game"
42-10 is my prediction.  There secondary is pretty dismal and they don‚Äôt have any good pass catchers outside of Waller.  There pass rush is decent but it‚Äôs not where it needs to be to be able to hide the trash secondary.  There OL will be bad because they haven‚Äôt played together much and are very young (no Icognito will hurt them too) so Carr won‚Äôt have much time to throw.  It could be closer if Waller has a dominant performance if Tavon doesn‚Äôt look right although we may not use him for Waller (maybe we use Stephens?).
Idk a lot of people saying blowouts but I am super nervous. I think just because it‚Äôs close to kickoff though but idk
"I think we blow them out full strength. Since we‚Äôre not full strength though, it‚Äôll probably be a close game. Maybe 27-24 Ravens?"
"Mini-Ravens 24, Raiders 14, for my old-school SNL fans."
Not only do I think it will be close. It is a must win with KC coming to town next week
"My prediction is that the Ravens go up big (17-20pts), but take our foot off the gas, and end up winning a closer game. 34-27"
45-13 ravens

Can I ask how you guys became Ravens‚Äô fans? Always curious how (wayyy) out-of-towners join the flock!

Of course. What else would he say? ‚ÄúThese guys are washed up and not good anymore. We are very worried.‚Äù
"Did the ravens already active those guys? Bell, Murray, and Freeman?"
"OK Greg, but did you even bother with a passing game this year?"
Those pass concepts better not be trash like last year. Obv we want to see what new receivers can do but what matters more is if they‚Äôre used properly
Ravens gonna lead the league in Rushing still aren‚Äôt we?
"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really excited‚Äù üòÇ

That‚Äôs the biggest pile of manure I‚Äôve ever read. I can only imagine the sleepless nights Roman is having lately lol üòÜ"

Heeeeap!!! Fond memories in this clip.

Thank you for this
What ya guys got?
Don't forget to take a shot for every illegal formation penalty
"Pregame: 
* 1 shot for every season-ending ACL/Achilles injury 

Live game: 
* Raven‚Äôs TD: 1 shot or finish whatever you‚Äôre drinking ATM
* highlight-worthy Lamar juke and defender whiff: 1 shot or finish whatever you‚Äôre drinking 
* COVID mentioned: take a drink 
* MVP mentioned: take a drink 
* Season injured player mentioned: take a drink 

You might get your stomach pumped playing with these rules lol.

I really liked this one. It was a refreshing break from that craptastic voice actor they normally have and they even broke away from that ‚ÄúBlue Collar Town‚Äù horseshit that every franchise feeds their fanbase.

They need content after the opening Sunday.  Tomorrow it‚Äôll be all about the Ravens-Raiders. You can‚Äôt get mad at how social media works.

This and Wednesday Frog over at r/caps gives me life
Every time this meme is posted we lose and Lamar performs poorly. Stop posting this meme!
Stuntin' means you ain't puntin'.

"Hi Ravens fans. I recently stumbled across All\_22\_NFL\_Cuts and really enjoyed their breakdowns. I figured some of you may be interested in checking out these guys as well. Give you something to watch while counting down the hours til game time.

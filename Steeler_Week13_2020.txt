"Through 10 games, the Steelers have scored 298 points and allowed 174 points, for a differential of +124.

The only other teams in the same galaxy as the Steelers are the Chiefs and Saints. Through 11 games, the Chiefs have scored 348 points and allowed 238 points, for a differential of +110, and the Saints have scored 326 points and allowed 225 points, for a differential of +101.

After that, the closest team is the Dolphins, who, through 11 games, have scored 284 points and allowed 205 points, for a differential of +79."
Yeah our defense is pretty good after all... We also haven't had a game where we've been outscored 🤷
This is one of those facts that just doesn't feel true no matter how true it is.
"Its a good flex for us as fans, but differential really means nothing in NFL. 


Best example is dolphins having a decent differential,  but bills lead their division. 


I can imagine ravens had a huge differential last year.. and look how far they got. 
I don't want to be the team that stomped all the crap teams but didn't step up in the playoffs."
Nah the browns by far the best point dif -21 8-3 record 😈😈🥶🥶🥶
"Obviously the Chiefs are special again this year, but how can everyone ride their jocks and shit on the Steelers when the Steelers have a better point differential and the Chiefs have a worse opponent record (the main knock on Pitt)"
Have the Steelers D and TJ Watt on my fantasy team

Everytime I hear the name Tim Tebow I instantly have flashbacks. pain

"Imagine if you posted this and someone was like ""hey, thats me in the troy jersey""... that would be pretty cool

I'm in that picture, just on the complete opposite side, section 510. Great shot"
"I love it! But the OCD me would perseverate on the Steelers logo on the field being slightly right of center. 

Great photo!"
Did you have a company do this? If so where can I get one
I love that a Polamalu jersey is smack dab in the center of it! Entirely fitting for an awesome canvas!
Canvasses? Canvi?
the logo not being centered bothers me just as much as the lines from the different canvas boards
Just don't hang it up like this.
I like how the Troy jersey ended up centered in the bottom

"I asked the opposite in chiefs sub and theya re not

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/k3uoqb)"
They should be afraid of our defense.
For the Steelers to win they need to rush 4 and hit mahomes often.
We don’t live in our fears.
"I'm afraid of them in the sense that I'd expect to be 6-8 point dogs to the Chiefs on a neutral field, 3-5 point dogs in Pittsburgh. 

The Chiefs offense is just a completely different beast. Mahomes's numbers against the blitz are absolutely stellar, so you can't just blitz him out of the stadium, but you also can't spot-drop zones either because he'll pick you apart there too. You look at what they've been able to do to the Ravens and the Bucs (who probably got lucky that the Chiefs seemed to go vanilla to not give anything away once the game was in hand) and you can see why a great day from the Steelers defense may need the offense to put up 30 to win.

I think the Steelers would definitely have a chance to win, but that chance is below 50%."
"My biggest fear is not the chiefs themselves but chiefs on a one score game with little time left. We continue seeing that Mahomes can go from the 20 yard line to the end zone/field goal range in a matter of seconds. I'm certain our defense will give him fits throughout the game, they're too good not to, but if they're down one scored or tied at the end of a game, it's likely game over no matte what defense"
"The more I see of the Chiefs the less concerned I am about them with our offense going up against their defense. Feels like they've got a serviceable defense that isn't capable of playing a full game where the game rests on their shoulders.

Twice now I've watched teams battle back against them like their defense wasn't even on the field and the games should have been handily tied up. And this isn't Steelers' football of take your foot off the gas cause you're up by two scores with half the game left either.

Our defense taking on their offense is when things get very interesting and potentially concerning. Not that our defense isn't up to the task but we are a team that starts slower and needs to feel things out live before we dial in to really start doing some damage. Our halftime adjustments this season have been incredible but I worry that our offense might not be able to dig us out of such a hole if Mahomes has a day where throws for over 400 yards, 3+ touchdowns, and rushes by himself for another 50+ yards because fuck it why not when you're that good? 

They come out fast and burn us over the middle which has been our weak spot for quarterbacks this season and that might be the game. However if our offense doesn't take two or three quarters to get moving I think we can keep pace and eventually bury them in the 4th quarter to win the game late. 

The Chiefs defense will be their downfall in the post season."
"The real issue will be do they get behind? If the offense does the typical slow start, and KC gets out to a 21 point lead, it’s probably over."
No.
[deleted]
"I want all the smoke. To be the best, you gotta beat the best."
"I'm not because even though our defense can't completely shut down Mahomes, I like their chances better than KC's defense shutting down Ben. To be sure, the last time Ben played in a playoff game he hung 469 yards and 5 TDs on the best defense in the league. Seems like people forget that cause we lost, but if we score 35+ against them, I don't really see any way that we lose."
Im afraid of the ticky tack roughing calls we will inevitably get called for when we breathe on Mahomes. But I think we are as well  equipped as any team to take them down. We have a stout defense and have enough weapons for a shootout.
"I haven’t watched a whole lot of chiefs games but am I wrong to believe that most of their offense is the unstoppable combo of Kelce, Hill and Mahones? Their run game is nothing to write home about although still good. If we could maybe double Hill and shut down those 10-15 yard gains from Kelce while our pass rush does it’s thing and not let Mahones escape to the sides... Although I could be making this way to simple as Hardman and Watkins could still be reliable if we devote to much to hill and Kelce"
"No, I think their defense is lousy. I also think they can’t put teams away. Not just last night but a few times this year they start very hot and then regress to nothing. I have so much confidence in our defense."
"Am i scared of them? No. Do i think they have the best shot to beat us out of anyone? Yes. They’re an exploitable team, constant pressure needs to be put on mahomes and the offense just has to keep pace which is much easier said than done, but possible."
"Offenses are overrated, defenses are underrated. I think that speaks for itself. If we sweep our division which is something they haven't been able to do I wouldn't be ""afraid"" of them."
"We don’t live in our fears

But Fr, if you wanna win you gotta be ready to beat anyone, anywhere. That and if we were to play them and win (which is a possibility, their defense is lacking imo) people can shut up about us being “overrated”

But like I said; their defense leaves something to be desired and so far that’s being masked by having Patrick fucking Mahomes, but that leaves you plenty at risk. Also I was watching the end of the game yesterday, and when the chiefs were trying to run out clock, some of that play calling to pass was pretty ballsy for only being up 3. It’s gonna be praised because it worked, but it could’ve looked like a much different story of even one of those doesn’t get completed. That could be big going forward if the chiefs keep playing these close games"
Why would I be afraid of grown men playing a ball game?
"Yes, I'm concerned about their passing game.  But we've got to scheme it so that Mahomes can't get comfortable.  Tall task, but I think we can do it."
I'd say we've put on a performance that would have beat the Chiefs in about 3 of our 10 games. Fortunately we still have more regular season to improve. I don't really see the Chiefs getting better as the season goes on.
No
We all bleed
I dont care about the chiefs right now. Im more focused on us getting the game against the ravens played.
We do not care who the opponent is. We will take to the field and take care of our business.
"The chiefs are the costs thing in the NFL to an B1G team playing a MAC team. In college, the game is all offense, and that what the chiefs are. And similar to if you were playing Clemson or OSU, you have to play a nearly perfect game against them. I still believe that the Steelers haven't played their best football yet, but I just hope our secondary can stand the test."
"Afraid might not be the best word. I would be excited and nervous to watch us take them on. I think we can beat them BUT we would have to win the turnover battle, put a lot of points on the board, manage to get a lot of pressure on Mahomes while only rushing 4, and just overall play our best game with virtually no mistakes. The Chiefs are an excellent team, and by far the biggest threat to us"
ITT: 369 honest people and 363 confused/naive ones
If you said no your a dumbass
They weren’t like they were last year imo
I’m going to assume that the people voting “no” haven’t watched a single Chiefs game. They’re the best team in the league until they aren’t.
"A little.. yeah. Our offense is wildly inconsistent and struggles to sustain drives. The Chiefs can score fast and from anywhere on the field. Yes, we have a good defense but the offense is going to need to be able to complete drives and put up points on the board and eat clock. Our run game is non existent at this point."
"On third down, yes.

We need to pressure Mahomes but we also need to be very careful when not to."
"I’ll be honest I haven’t watched the chiefs too closely this season, so I don’t know how well their o - line is. But they have a massive passing game around mahomes. Couple that around our secondary being the weaker (still by no means weak) part of our defense and yeah, I’m scared that they could pull off something more than most other teams.

I still think it’d be a close game and I’m looking forward to the matchup if it happens in the playoffs."
"""We do not live in our fears."""
"I wouldnt say ""afraid""

I recognize that they are a hell of a team and would be a tough game
but I can see us beating them

of course I could see them beating us as well"
"I worry simply because, our defense hasn't faced a high caliber quarterback this season.  Yes, we beat Lamar Jackson, but I wouldn't consider him to be a high quality passer just yet.  Time and time again has shown, if you take away his ability to run, the Ravens' entire game plan cannot adjust.  We've faced tons of rookie quaterbacks this year as well, and the only quality quarterback we've faced has been Deshaun Watson, and he has absolutely no help like Mahomes does.  

If we beat them, it'll have to be in a shootout.  As many have pointed out, simply blitzing him isn't going to shut him down.  They're going to put up thirty points.  Our offense is good enough to keep the score competitive, but I really worry about our running game, which has been nonexistent for most of this season.  We're not going to win if Roethlisberger is having to throw 50 passes."
If they let Ben run the O and can match Mahomes then it’s an easy dub but if we hand Benny Snell the ball 3 times in a row we gonna be in trouble
"Afraid of no team. The Chiefs are playing great football, and have been for over a season or two. They’re still the favorites to win it all, but I like our team and I like our chances against them, if the teams meet in the playoffs."
It is what is is. We are not afraid.
Must not fear. Fear is the mind killer.
"No, their defense is not good"
"Anybody saying no is a clown tbh. I understand we're 10-0, but we have definitely had a lot of games where if we were playing vs the cheifs we would've lost. Their offence is scary, and if anybody beats us in the playoffs, it would most likely be them."
"Afraid is a weird word. At this point, I’m not afraid of any team in the NFL, however I would say the Chiefs would be the favorites to beat us in a head to head matchup."
*We do not care*
"If our offense could get going from the get go instead of “warming up”, then I think we could match the chiefs. We haven’t shown that yet and Mahomes is just on another level right now, so I would definitely want to avoid them for as long as necessary until things get sorted out offensively."
I bleed black and gold and always will. My husband of 20 years is the biggest Chief fan. This will be interesting. Go Steelers
For those who say no you're either lying or stupid.
Why not?
Yep. There’s really no advantage. Hope his ankle is hurt or he his receivers drop balls lol. He’s a beast
"If Kelce falls down a hole like he did in Moonbase 8, then I totally see us having a shot."
"Just wanted to throw up my Ts and Ps for all of your players on the COVID list and hope that they are good to go and get healthy ASAP!...also... fuck the Ravens...

On a side note, I have to ask... what is it with Steelers having so many players with luscious beards??? They are glorious! Lol. Must be something in the water! 

Good luck tomorrow night y’all!"
"Appreciate it! T's and P's up for anyone with it, especially high risk people like Conner or Andrews. Also, it takes one to know one. Since Keisel retired, Fitzmagic has taken up the mantle for best NFL beard and he's done it wonderfully"
Who has a luscious beard on the steelers right now? I'm blanking
"Thank you for the T's and P's. Others have addressed the current beards. I think the best beard we've ever had belonged to Brett Keisel.

Lastly, fuck the Ravens."
Thank you! Good luck with the rest of your season. I am sure you guys can stomp the bungles but it looks like your schedule is about to get tough. I'll be rooting for the Dolphins to take down the Chiefs.

all the hype for this game has been killed already.
Denver & San Francisco combined: What the fuck is this bullshit?
So....is this a precursor to them cancelling the game? The only winner in a rescheduled game is the ravens I'm sure they are waiting for this to happen.
"Travel problems? You’d think the nine players that they have left that are eligible to play could pack into a mini van at this point and drive to Pittsburgh. 

The Steelers should not be punished for their negligence."
"Also from this tweet:

> Ravens’ travel plans in flux, with snow forecasted in Pitt on Tuesday am.

Is the storm they're calling for in Pittsburgh that bad?"
Is it possible this is just a precaution? Like just shut down the facility for this last day to ensure no spread is occurring?
"Lurking Browns fan here.

Steelers are the best team in football right now. If this ends in a forfeit, the Ravens organization should be forced to pay the Steelers’ salaries for the game. Totally ridiculous, no way one “staffer,” caused an outbreak of 30+ players and staff. Seems pretty clear they weren’t adhering to protocols."
I am still not confident this game happens this week.
"Bend over, here comes another assfucking."
"Playing this game makes *almost* no sense at all, but I guess still better than forefeit/Week 18"
weren’t the ravens in their facility yesterday? what the fuck is going on
For the sake of players safety this game should be called off. Ravens have to travel today on a plane. If tests don't come back quickly one or more of the team could have the virus and give it to us tomorrow..fuck that.
They couldn't have practiced anyway right? The NFL told teams to close all facilities today and tomorrow so them trying to practice is just a violation of that. I'm not 100% certain it's just something I'm confused about
This game needs to be shit canned
"Didn't the NFL already shut down all team facilities league wide for today and tomorrow? How were the Ravens planning on practicing?

There's no way they actually play tomorrow, right?"
"If the Steelers have a walk-through today, then the game is on."
"LOL gonna make a team play a game with one day of practice???

Context is we was going to the mothafucking super bowl
Rashard mending Ben’s hall.
AFC Championship game 2011.
"So if both the Steelers and chiefs have 1 loss going into the playoffs, can anyone explain to me how they would decide who gets the number 1 seed?

Also, after the game last night, the chiefs are pretty spooky. How do we beat them? Seems like Mahomes does so well with pressure if he can escape to the outside. Maybe the key to victory is forcing him to stay in the pocket while we collapse with Tj and bud containing him?? 

Have a good day Steelers nation!! Here we go"
"Ive thought the buccaneers were over rated all year. I really don’t think they’re that great they didn’t adjust to tyreek hill. 

The key to beating mahomes is to keep him off the field as much as possible... if hes clicking like he was yesterday theres no stopping that. You just try to limit the damage and try force field goals"
Whoever has the better conference record will be the 1 seed
"If I am not mistaken, the first tie breaker is head to head (doesn't apply here), the second is conference record and the third is strength of schedule."
I was trying to figure this out myself. It depends on the loss. You can work through the scenarios on the [NYT Playoff Picture](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/upshot/pittsburgh-steelers-nfl-playoff-picture.html#pit-bal-12=win&pit-was-13=win&kc-den-13=win&mia-kc-14=loss&buf-pit-14=loss&no-kc-15=loss&cin-pit-15=loss&kc-atl-16=win&pit-ind-16=win&cle-pit-17=loss&kc-lac-17=win&event=seed1).
"Depends who the Steelers lose to. If the one loss is outside the division then we would own the number 1 seed since the chiefs lost to a divisional opponent. However, if our one loss is within our division then points per game and other types of stats are considered which I believe would give the edge to the Chiefs."
"The first tie breaker will be division record. So if we don’t lose to any AFCN opponents we would have the first round bye. If by some chance our only loss goes to an AFCN opponent, the Chiefs get the #1 seed as their strength of schedule is technically more difficult (.500 - .457).   


Fun fact: if every previous tie breaker results in a tie or is N/A, they measure strength of victory —> W/L/T % vs. Common opponents —> W/L/T % vs. Conference opponents—> W/L/T % vs. All Opponents —> Best Net Points in Common games —> Best Net points in all games —> Best Touchdowns in all games —> Coin toss.


No playoff spot has ever been decided by the coin toss.









TLDR: Keep winning and it doesn’t matter ;)"
"Tie breaking procedure is givin [here](https://www.nfl.com/standings/tie-breaking-procedures).  

Basically it depends who the loss is to first and foremost."

I’ve honestly been curious to this all year. Super annoying to see the positive cases reported on monday knowing damn well the guys positive on monday were more than likely positive on gameday
"None of this is cut and dried.  Vance felt sick, and tested negative, then tested positive days later.  Tests aren't 100% accurate, and the conditions for which the test is checking on takes time to develop.  If a few virus molecules enter your system, you aren't going to test positive 5 minutes later.

Testing on game day does not make the situation any better.  Especially with all the false positives."
"A lot of the rapid tests are only somewhat effective. From experience, having known people that have been tested, the rapid tests come back the quickest (these are roughly 60-80 percent effective from what I've been told) and they recommend you remain quarantined until the culture test comes back. The culture takes roughly five days and is more effective. So, you can be negative on a rapid, but come positive on the culture. Is the NFL using something that we the public doesn't get? Possibly, but may explain why."
"There should be accurate rapid testing, but the Ravens have no right to be upset about this. It's been the same protocol for every team with every game, including the teams who don't have outbreaks. If memory serves correct, it was the pre-game test before the Cowboys game where Vance McDonald tested positive. He took the test, played 24 total snaps in the game (20 on offense and 4 on ST according to PFR) let alone all the time on the sideline, he apparently sat next to Roethlisberger on the plane ride back to Pittsburgh (if someone knows how to confirm that but I'm pretty sure I read that somewhere)...and there wasn't an outbreak. Because unlike Harbaugh and the Ravens, Tomlin runs a tight ship and doesn't allow a conspiracy theorist on his staff to flout safety protocols."

"I loved this line - I was at the game that preceded this in Baltimore when Dennis Dixon almost managed to pull out a W.

Unfortunately they followed it up with Ls to a 5-win Raiders team and a 5-win Browns team."
Was this the first time Mike used “and things of that nature”?

"Idk how many people have to explain this until people like you actually read it, pay attention and actually understand it. The Ravens outbreak is not the same as the Broncos. 

The Broncos had a small handful of players test positive from the same position and then it stopped. The Ravens entire team and office is affected and they have no idea who else may still test positive. 

How the hell are you guys so oblivious to something that’s so easy to comprehend?"
"You idiots don't understand it's for the safety of the STEELERS PLAYERS that this game has been postponed. Jesus this is getting ridiculous. I want to see my favorite team play football as much as the next person, but not if it means next week we will have 20 players out with COVID and fuck our entire season, not to mention the healthy risks involved.

The Broncos had CLOSE CONTACTS that caused their team to sit out their QBs, not legitimate positive tests. The Broncos played it safe, the Ravens have a mass outbreak. These aren't even related.

Edit: I typically avoid harsh words like that but I'm keeping it in. It's been fucking mind numbing seeing the anger over keeping the STEELERS safe and healthy down the stretch. Fuck."
"Would we rather the NFL made this game happen while Ravens players were still testing positive? 

That would mean our guys would be catching the virus too - we can all see that, right?.

Not saying the NFL is handling this season well, but I'd rather our guys stayed healthy if at all possible."

if we lose a playoff bye because of this i may be deceased
This is pretty stupid
If the playoffs are expanded to 16 teams the ravens should be disqualified from getting the 8th spot. It would be weird but all of this is unprecedented.
"WOW! Ravens just placed 4 more on the list.
This is nuts
Mark Andrews, Matthew Judon, Willie Snead IV and Terrell Bonds

Edit- I guess it’s not 4 more, they just finally added them. Maybe after another -positive?"
Fuck this person and his baseless conjecture.
Now seeing reports that they have been offered the option to fly to Pitt tomorrow
"I just watched the Winston dance video.  How are they preventing spread from normal activities.  Even if their not dancing without a masks I’m going to assume the virus is still going to spread in a tight locker room.

Same thing with weight room.  Unless their limiting weight room time to like 60 min a day and having a capacity of like 10 it can still spread.

And they do practice right?  And practice plays.  For secondary guys it might not be a big deal - but if you are practicing plays with a qb and a center and a couple guards and dline their too close to limit spread.

I’m having trouble believing these outbreaks are do to protocol breaks versus things that need to be done.

Testing every day is the thing that should work.  Keeping a guy away when he has enough viral load to spread."
"[ADAM SCHEFTER] NFL still is waiting on the results from today’s round of COVID tests, per sources. Ravens cannot go until they are cleared - if they are cleared. There will be uneasy, uncomfortable people if trip goes on, but two organizations and a network awaiting word."

"""Pondering."" Yeah, it sure seems like Pinky and the Brain are making these idiotic decisions."
Gonna go to wednesday huh
It blows my mind that the NFL is bending over backwards for the Ravens.
The NFL DOES NOT want to push this game. My assumption is that their number one priority is containment. If they have information putting other players at risk then that’s probably why. And I’ll take healthy Steelers over a delay every day of every week.

At what point do we get to say the nfl is rigged.

"Ravens fan checking in

I say we forfeit"
"To add to it, the ravens' next game is pushed to Tuesday, while the Steelers' is pushed to Monday...."
"This is getting ridiculous at this point. The Broncos situation was much different, just a handful of guys in an isolated incident that was directly and undeniably the fault of members of the organization. The ratbirds are in the midst of a legitimate outbreak which sucks for them and I honestly hope they can get it under control for the health and safety of everyone involved. At this point though, our schedule has been massively disrupted through no fault of our own, and the league cares less about maintaining competition than they do playing games.

It's not like we weren't some competitive imbalances this year due to covid, but it seems like the Steelers have bared the brunt of them WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING WRONG. If Mike Tomlin doesn't win coach of the year I'm going to go ape shit."
Denver Donkeys...I like the alliteration
They want to force a week 18 game so we don’t push their shit in by 50. It’s all about ratings.
"Tebow was likely on speed dial.

Him or Brian Griese."
"To be fair, the NFL wasn’t relying on generating ratings from the donkey game. Having said that, the NFL gives zero fucks about what’s fair."
"The word ""gorgeous"" has nothing to do with the name ""George,"" etymologically."
They better bump their next game. So unfair.
i mean theyre not far off...
Kinda odd how the ravens got the favourable reschedule
It's not even the fact that they rescheduled again. It's the fact that it's on at a time when everybody is at work.  The NFL can't even make any money if nobody is watching the game on TV because they also won't have fans at the game.  WTF is the play NFL?
"is not the ravens, its the game. they know this game will pull viewers so more money. nobody would have watched that broncos game, one could even argue that no quarterbacks means more viewers since more fans are interested to see how it plays out. ravens vs steelers are always great games, especially this year. Lets stop being so ignorant and look at this objectively"
"I thought in Baltimore, they say it like sheeeeeeeiiit?"
To be fair Broncos were dumb enough to not have a “covid” quarterback who practices separately from the others which the NFL recommended to avoid issues like this.
"I listen to DVE every morning through iHeart...can you listen to the Steelers through that? I’ve never tried

I’m working until 5 and just might take my old school radio in with me"
Some double standard bs
"&#x200B;

>Ravens players recently conducted a players-only meeting in which  they expressed concerns regarding playing on Tuesday as they've been  adamant about wanting a day to practice, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport  reported. Rapoport added that other notes to come from the meeting were  that the Ravens want to play, but health and safety must come first.

They better change the game against Washington to Monday as well. Cause this is bullshit otherwise.
SNIP SNAP SNIP SNAP
I’m over it at this point. The league should be embarrassed.
"Jesus fucking christ. I cannot believe how badly the NFL is pissing down their own pant legs because of this situation. 

It's not hard. Their coach violated protocols that directly caused this outbreak. They should have to forfeit, not play six days later (after throwing a wildcat temper tantrum) and cause a cascade of moves to other teams as well. 

The disparity between how the league treats teams in regards to COVID is insane to me. 

Ravens fans can talk about Conner all they want, but it wasn't directly traced back to a coach just fucking refusing to follow guidelines. Folks who can't see the substantive difference between the two are blinded by their homerism. 

I want this game to be played. But at this point the NFL and their indecisiveness have portrayed them, yet again, to be a bunch of buffoons. 

Fuck Harbaugh
Fuck Goodell
Fuck COVID"
I just wanna say: Fuck u Roger Goodell just let us forfeit we don’t care about ur television money
"If there was no positives today, why did they wait to postpone till now? If the reason is the Ravens need to practice fine whatever, but why wait until ~24 hours before kickoff to make that call? Quit jerking us around for fucks sake"
Is the next week game still on Sunday? No way
This fucking whole thing is some major bullshit.  If I was your team I would be raising all sorts of bloody hell right now.  Like how at this point just *playing* the Ravens is a risk in itself... they should forfeit and stop playing around.
Must be nice to have the nfl bend over backwards for your Neanderthal team
"Bro this is ridiculous at this point, almost laughable."

Take my upvote. Great find of a recent picture of John Harbaugh there.
"The ravens are playing chess right now while Goodell is playing checkers. The games gonna be pushed back to week 18 which will expand the playoffs to 8 teams. Ravens will slide right into that 8th spot. If the Steelers are able to stay in first, they lose their first round bye. Thus leading to #1 Steelers vs #8 ravens for the first round of playoffs with the Steelers essentially not having a bye week the entire season."
Double-header Sunday we play the Ravens at 9am and the Football Team at 4:25pm.
Ratbirds will get the 2 RB's and a couple of lineman off the Covid list by a Wednesday game time. I don't believe  in coincidence.
"What the hell? Time to award the game to Steelers and take a game off the Ratbirds for not complying with protocols. Come on NFL do the right thing, we've been screwed around enough."
"Steelers are the only team getting jerked around. Other teams are being forced to play, but not the Steelers' opponent.

Rooneys need to put their foot down and stop being a doormat."
it already is next week.
"Come on, Baltimore, get your shit together."
I am really tired of Crybaugh and his shinnanigins. They should not benefit from a problem of their own doing. The Steelers need to take their frustrations out on them.
The NFL needs to find a way to force the ravens to forfeit and force the Steelers to pay their players despite the rules.
They need to change there name to The Virus Monkeys.
wednesday at 3;20 PM because NBC commited to the rockerfellar xmas tree lighting
okay this is getting ridiculous.  It's time they tell the Ravens 'sorry boys it's a forfeit'.

Just let us forfeit goddammit it’s not that hard
I heard they’re practicing tonight and tomorrow. If they’re so concerned they shouldn’t be able to do that 🤷🏼‍♀️
just keep moving the finish line
"So....according to the above, these players will NOT practice tomorrow since they are worried about the outbreak.

Right?"
"It is reasonable, health is most important.  But, there should be harsh punishment put on them for causing this.  We should get their first round pick next year.  That sounds fair to me.  Ha."
"Cute coming from the team who actively broke protocols lol.

Also, didn't Harbaugh get fined for not wearing his mask consistently during games earlier this season? Get outta here with this nonsense."
"Lmfaoooo bitch made 😂

How many guys you think come off their covid list tomorrow?

The NFL gave them what they wanted. The biggest crybaby HC pleaded his way into this. “We’ll be ready for Tuesday” stfu. Player safety? Stfu. 

Goodells ravens, what else can you say?"
"Honestly that’s fair, but if it gets rescheduled again, it’s gotta be a forfeit. Steelers have been ready to play all three times"
Can we at least get any players back? By any I mean tuitt..
"I actually agree with the Ravens reasoning on this, I can understand wanting to make very sure that its contained, but fuck man Steelers getting shafted."
"Feels reasonable. Players want to know the outbreak is contained before getting on a plane/bus together. 

I'd rather see this get pushed to week 18 than be played midweek though. This throws everything out of wack for the rest of our season."
"I seriously hate that team. I had respect for the rivalry at a time but after this, all the whining, all the league bending over backward to help them get players back, totally messing up our schedule, I want to see them crushed mercilessly"
Answer should be: No.
""
Well that's an interesting twist to this debacle
"A forfeited game counts as a game played and a 2-0 win.  So it would not be a cancelled game, and the players should be paid."
"Maybe this is one of the reasons the NFL seems so intent on playing the game, because teams might end up being on the hook for player payments regardless."
hen I guess they just don't want to pay the players for NOT playing the game. ..also NBC has MILLIONS tied up in purchasing the rights to the Thanksgiving Night rivalry game that would have likely had the highest ratings of the season.
Imagine if the game were to be forfeit what that would mean to future contracts if only players with guaranteed money get paid. Interesting.

"This year, the Steelers lost their bye week, lost their ""mini bye week"", and now have to play WFT on am entire week's less rest, and then have another short week against the Bills. The Steelers have gotten massively screwed this year, and we have followed protocol the best in the league. It is fair to assume we will play the whole season on about 5 days rest, which I imagine is the lowest ever, or at least close to it. Absolutely asinine what's happening to us."
Tuitt went on the Reserve/COVID list along with Hawkins and Buggs on the 27th.  Does that mean they are eligible to play on Wednesday with 5 days of negative testing?
"So we'll have 3 days to recover and prep for Washington?

Sounds fair!"
"in the words of coach tomlin...

we.  do.  not.  care.

steelers will play thu, sat, sun, mon, ~~tue~~, wed and will be prepared.

i'm tired of the whining (outside and inside).  i enjoy the adversity - let's just line up and hit.

"But don’t forget, “ThEy HaVe OnE oF tHe WeAkEsT sChEdUlEs”"
"And this latest PPD is the worst, because the Ravens had no new cases! The prior ones were at least understandable and needed to happen for health reasons. But the Ravens literally just asked the NFL to move the game and they did! Just a day after making the Broncos play with a practice squad WR at QB. The rest of the delays were just unlucky, but this one feels like a product of clear favoritism."
I actually think the Seahawks have been handling it better than us. They haven’t had a single positive test
You had a bye week in week 4 though. Some of what you’re saying is accurate but man there are some revisionist fans in here

Don’t let them find this out. The game will be pushed back even further! Haha

Okay but how many of the close contacts can play?
"Just take your ass whupping and move on Baltimore!

Geez."
"Lamar Jackson is the least of the issue. The real issue is that the NFL is continually fucking with an undefeated team.from the Titans game on out. The one team that keeps getting fucked(through NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN).

Is the Pittsburgh fucking Steelers."
"Unpopular opinion:  Lamar Jackson is probably the most replaceable player on Baltimore's roster.  Their backup is literally the exact same player anyway, he's just called ""RG3"" instead.

Meanwhile the NFL let Baltimore get half their fucking offense back, including offensive linemen for whom the #2 guys on the depth chart are not genetic clones of the guys who are #1 on the depth chart."
We all want to play but at the same time we don’t want them to infect us and derail our season for sure

"Alternate headline:

""Pretty much everyone except Roger fucking Goodell unhappy about handling of Steelers game."""

Maybe they should be unhappy with how their ownership handled someone obviously breaking protocols by not wearing his mask or his tracking gear at all times.
"So if I’m getting my facts straight... the Ravens strength coach broke protocol, got basically the whole team infected, then the game gets moved from Thursday to Sunday. More Ravens test positive meaning the game gets moved again from Sunday to Tuesday, while Denver who did exactly as they’re supposed to do had 1 positive and 3 close contacts in the QB room get absolutely hosed Sunday. Now the Ravens are saying they must get practices in and would prefer to play Thursday, so the NFL compromised with Wednesday and THEY are the ones who are unhappy.... 

Crazy double standard by the league with how they’re handling this compared to Denver and absolute incompetence by the Ravens. Also why is Baltimore basically calling the shots here? It’s our home game, and the leagues call. They should have 0 say."
"J. Zucker? Sounds familiar...

I don't want it to happen for several reasons but at this point the game seriously needs to be forfeited
"They'll move the game to week 18 long before they force them to forfeit. Should they be forced to forfeit? After everything came out about their coach, yes they should. But the NFL has too much at stake and money in the game to make them forfeit, the nfl cares more about money than their players it's a sad truth."

So now we’re playing December 7th?
That’s better than on Sunday...
"After their lost last week, they got out out of the playoff picture. But the league has been saying they will add an 8th seed depending on how the season goes. So if I’m the ravens and I’m already out of the playoff picture, why would I go and play the only undefeated team in the NFL and go another game back when I could get get it postponed, mess up the NFL schedule and steal the 8th seed. 

The only way to prevent this is make them forfeit if we can’t get Wednesday’s night game played.

Edit: Definitely meant Ravens have everything to gain. Sorry"
"Hows that our gain? 

Thats the ravens gain fam"
The 8th seed would only be added if a whole bunch of games got cancelled and they couldn't be played by adding a week 18.
"So it’s good that they screwed protocol, skipped a game they should lose, get a playoff spot, and we don’t get a bye for being a one seed?"

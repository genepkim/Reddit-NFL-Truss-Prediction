He always does that to the Titans. This is the trap game.
"It's a 1:00pm game, so unfortunately unlikely to see 500 yard, 6 TD Ben. All his 500 yard and 6 TD games were either late afternoon or primetime games. 1:00pm Ben is, unfortunately, when we usually see worst Ben."
50/50 on this game hopefully they don’t sleep on an 0-2 team per usual.  Watson is scary good imo.  Keys to winning are constantly pressuring him and limiting mistakes.  Something else to consider their coach has poor game management.
"It’s the trap game, I said it earlier in the week. Texans are a desperate team."
I’m with ya bud. 9 hours til kickoff!
"It’s definitely the trap game, there’s no way we should have better odds to beat the Texans than we had before we beat Denver and the Giants."
"10% Texans win.

1% 500/6 Ben game.

89% ""something in between""."
"If Ben doesn't throw the ball to a Texans defender, we should be OK."
 I hope they come out with a W. That is all.
You're not alone. I've been thinking these are the games that they seem to traditionally lose.
Trap
Cue admiral ackbar
Deadass though
"Stop saying this is a potential trap game.

The Texans are a good football team. They’re far better than their record."
So damn true
"The Texans aren't the Giants, Broncos, Bengals, etc. Are we favorites? Yeah but not overwhelmingly so. 

Too early in the season for that I think."
"He is good at football, when I see Claypool get a catch I say “Yes”. I think he is good at his job, I hope he stays in the Steelers employ that is all."
When I see Chase Claypool not targeted I say “no”.
I agree.
Vote upward.

I love it when Chase does well at that sport that he plays
"I see this post I say ""Yes""."
"Les claypool was in the band primus for a long time. But for a short while he did a side project called “les claypools flying frog brigade.”

It’s the most random thing in the world, but whenever I hear chase claypools name I always mutter “and his flying frog brigade” under my breath.

This has nothing to do with anything but I like that band name and needed to get that off my chest"
"When Claypool not on field I say “no”

When Claypool on field I say “yes”"
As a Canadian fan of the Steelers I had to order his jersey. Hopefully he can become a big part of this team.

Is that you Geno?

What do women’s pants have to do with TJ and Bud???
We don't seek comfort in fuzzy blankets
"STARTING DEFENSE

PLACE AT THE TABLE"
"The nickname of this new defense should be:

Women's pants - they don't come with pockets."
Can't believe Dupree is alright now that Watt is on the other side
"Attn AFC North: Draft all the 'elite' QBs you want, these two are just going to plant them on their ass no matter what"
Lets fucking goooo
I love how much Bud Dupree has blossomed since TJ Watts joined the team!

"I have watched too many high caliber Steelers squads go into should be win situations and coming up short. Titans, and Raiders in back to back weeks of when they sucked."
I’m still amazed at how many people think Houston is a definitive “bad” team when any team in the league would be 0-2 after playing KC and Baltimore to start the season. Pittsburgh would be 0-2 if we had to do that no doubt in my mind.
Uhhhh dude. Shut up. This is a trap game for sure.
Already wrong lol
Not looking to accurate rn
Holy shit 😂
Yikes
Haaaard disagree based on what I've seen from my Steelers lol
Don't post this! Unless it's after the fact!
not quite 35-13 but ill take a win anyday
We should get their Watt because we beat them.  It'd be just like when Mega Man beats a boss and gets their weapon.
Would be a great meme if we didn’t have a third-rate secondary.
This didn't age well... I still have hope
Well this aged poorly.
"I’m worried that Keith Butler is going to do some stupid shit and try to blitz Watson like we have been doing against the Giants and Broncos. If he does that, we will absolutely get picked apart by Watson. Hope Butler is smart enough to realize that."
"Thanks for sharing your anxieties.  ""Worry is interest paid on trouble borrowed"""
Maybe you shouldn’t be too worried. I saw a stat this week that said Watson had one of the worst QBRs when pressured. So maybe that’s not such a bad game-plan.
"Disagree, you should be putting as much pressure on Watson as possible. No doubt that he will break many tackles but you have to keep him uncomfortable. Their O-Line is pretty bad, force him to make throws."
"Don't worry, be happy. 

It's game day my dude."
Watson is terrible under pressure.
"I think a good combo of pressure and contain can go along way. When you have a stout front AND speed on the outside you can neutralize running QB's. Danger is Watson just throwing to Hopkins running free..oh, wait..."
"I’m mad 

>He mad

But I aint stressin"
"We play in the division with Lamar Jackson, I'm not too worried that Butler won't scheme well for Watson.  I am worried about the drop off in run defense from week 1 to week 2 and of course, the secondary needs to be better this week."
Maybe you were right:/
Let’s hope this game doesn’t come down to Butt’s intelligence.
We will shut down every thing but the QB run. Watson will run all over the place. Big Ben probably has a pick or two. We probably win by 3 or lose by 14. This has trap game written all over it.
"Honestly I doubt it.


Texans have the worst O line in the league and we have the best pass rush.  Hopefully he realizes that we can get pressure and sacks without blitzing"
"Your worries that the DC of the best defensive unit in professional football might not understand defense at the same lofty level as you, Internet guy, are probably unfounded."
Stfu and stop posting reactionary bullshit after one half of football.

This post aged... humorously
"How ya like them apples?! We did it!

Edit: Guess I should have said break past 27, since that was the highest output we had last season!"
I like the optimism
"OOOOoooohhh boy, we're trying"
looking pretty possible right now
We literally could have ran 3 yards and gone past the 28 points mark

"Hey guys, giants fan coming in peace. Just wondering and had a quick question on who you guys think I should start at WR2 for my espn fantasy team - Juju or Diontae? I just picked up Diontae and not too familiar with your guys WR situation. I had Juju starting ever since week 1 against my giants and of course he goes off but he only got me 11.8 points last week and I unfortunately lost by 0.2 points. I’m leaning more towards starting Diontae but wonder what y’all think. Thanks for the advice and hope you guys beat the Texans today.


Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions. I’m now leaning towards putting Juju back in the starting lineup and benching Diontae. Good luck to all of you guys in fantasy and against the Texans"
"Full PPR diontae, standard or 1/2 juju"
This is tough because Dionte has been getting a lot of targets lately. I’d say Juju because Diote has played a little sloppy the last couple games (muffed punt and a fumble). I’m starting Juju as well.
Why not start one at flex and one as WR2? They can both be supported every week
"JuJu has been out of practice with a hurt knee.  I'm sure he'll be good for the game, but something to consider.  I'd probably go JuJu because he's really clicking with Ben since his return, but honestly you can't go wrong with either."
"If you have another strong WR starting and can take a mini gamble, I say start Johnson. I have Johnson starting this week ob my fantasy team.. I feel like he’s going to have a breakout game with Ben soon, and as betting it’s this week."
"I'd go JuJu over Johnson on this one.

Johnson's hands aren't 100% surefire and he's already displayed some less than desirable catches/drops this season. With that in mind I think JuJu gets more attention because the Texans will take advantage of great field placement and punish us for turnovers. 

Thinking we play this one more cautious and Johnson is a wild card."
juju is the safe bet jhonson is the boom or bust stress out watching the game till the boom or cry through the bust. i have jhonson in this week because i think hes going to boom today
NFL network reported Ben made an effort to work with Diontae a lot this week. That combined with more targets may mean a big game for Diontae today.
Its really a 50/50 honestly. Good luck

I like how he thinks I could actually make it to the game anyways.

Be very glad you didn't see that.  I was working that day and I kept checking the score and every time I looked i was another TD for the Texans.  One of the most ridiculous lopsided stat losses of all-time.
"Here’s the ESPN summary for the game. The Texans had a 40 yard fumble return for a TD, a 70 yard INT return for a TD and a 65 yard INT return for a TD. They managed a FG on their own. 

https://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=221208023"
I watched that one. The most frustrating game I've ever seen. 400+ yards of offense and your defense gives up 40+ yards and you lose because your O has 3 turnovers that are returned for TDs.
"I was there and people were screaming for Tommy Maddox's head. I still remember a guy repeatedly screaming ""burn in hell Maddox!""  They dominated in everything but a couple of pick sixes made it a blowout loss."
The frustration of that game still feels like yesterday.  Be glad you missed it.

I wish there was a nfl package that they didn’t play commercials. I’d rather watch the players stand around BS’ing for five minutes than watch another State Farm commercial. Jesus
"Vince Williams has played out of his mind so far this year, all 3 games. 

just don't put him on a WR please"
I can’t believe that non-call on Claypool. You could see his whole arm being held from the moon.
This is the most pathetic excuse of a fucking referee crew I've ever fucking seen
I am going to lose my fucking mind.. I have now watched for the last 2 fucking years that the Oline is allowed to fucking hold TJ whenever they fucking want. It might be that I’m biased so I’m always watching but some of it is just ridiculous. Dude is getting fucking tackled.
Having JuJu > not having JuJu
FIRE THESE GARBAGE ASS TRASH CANS WITH STRIPES
"I'm not going to start praising Conner as just an incredible RB but anyone saying he's not a good player clearly is expecting too much. He gets the job done, and that's all we need."
"2 timeouts and half a minute? Yeah, let's kneel on it."
I’m probably the king of excusing drops but both of those were must catches
Like am I an idiot that's pass interference by every definition of the rule no? He literally made him make that catch on handed by wrapping both arms around one of Chases what the fuck
Is that not DPI? Holding a full arm back?
I'm glad the players aren't as mentally weak as some of the posters here.
If I hear “Texans are 0-2” one more time my brain is going to explode
"This is why I hate prevent defense. Defense gets soft in order to not give up a TD instead of stopping a score. What's the point of it, as long as they have timeouts? By the time they get to the redzone it doesn't matter anyways and you're just letting them get there for free. Watson took them 75 yards in under a minute. Dumbasses."
McCloud is a madman holy fuck he ate that hit
"If you are blaming Ben or Claypool, you are a fucking idiot who doesn't know shit."
This officiating crew is a joke.
Conor at 5.3 yards per carry. McFarland at 7 yards per carry.  Maybe we should keep running.
"I can’t believe we pulled this one out. The first two games were mismatches, this is the first win that actually tells me this team could be legit"
"When your entire defense is based around pressuring the QB, it’s hard to win when the refs refuse to call holding"
2 minute drill ben is my favorite Ben
Can we just tell Ben that every drive is a 2 minute drill?
I dont know about you but that was not claypools fault. That was PI as fuck these refs are blind
"Nice pick but holy shit these holds are getting ridiculous, how do our opponents have 0 holding calls in 3 weeks?"
 I hate these tik tok commercials so much
WERE 3-0. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME WE WERE 3-0?!?
Are we....not gonna talk about how his arm was held
Love how the NFL just decided to not call holding this year
"Every time the other team scores I think them stillers are a bunch of bums


Every time the stillers score I think them stillers are GOIN TO THE SUPER BOWL"
I am not a fan of drops and things of that nature
McCloud looks like our kick returner moving forward.
How the fuck is that not pi?
"Well... fuck... freaking 1 hand held and no call and he STILL almost had it.  Also, eat a dick announcer... you're ALLOWED to say he got away with PI."
Fuck these refs!! Last week we got called the most bs DPI but apparently you can hold a receivers whole ass arm down
So no one saw the corner pulling Chase’s arm when he was trying to make the catch?? No one????
That was a good drive. In my opinion scoring a touchdown was the proper strategy there.
Juju lead blocks SO well. Esp for a No.1. Then the 2pt too!
All I'm saying is we're MOTHAFUKKIN UNDEFEATED SINCE THE RETURN OF THE CHONKY KING. THATS MY MOTHERFUKKIN QB. 3-0 🅱️🅱️!
"Official: 2 Watts beat 1 Watt.

#science"
Imagine not covering JuJu lmao
"texans were giving up the most QB pressure in the league

Steelers were getting the most QB pressure in the league

NONE OF THAT IS WORKING OUT"
Just removed my blue sweatshirt to reveal my Steelers shirt. Our fortunes are about to change.
"damn, Ray Ray don't give a fuck."
"Every success by this offense is in spite of Fichtner, not because of him."
"After a 3-and-out, give up an immediate sack, run up the middle when you need 19 yards, throw a 14 yard pass when you need 15 yards.

Everything about that was unbelievable stupid."
The run on 2 and 19 is like pulling out just to finish on yourself
"He fucking had claypool's arm, WTF????"
How is that not holding wtf?
Well that'll work... NOW GET A GOD DAMN TOUCHDOWN (and the 2 point conversion)
That TJ hits gonna piss some people off lmao
Ok Ben... now we need a drive.. don't let this pick go to waste
"Tennessee next week, that’ll be rough as fuckkkkk but if we can shut down Henry who knows"
I hope this is a lesson to most of you. It’s not over in the 1st quarter. Ben is a bad motherfucker and our defense is not something to fuck with. 3-0 baby. Let’s GOO!
"JJ talking to his brothers like he lost a bet and doesn't want to pay, lol."
Imagine how many sacks tj would have if they didn’t hold him every play
LET BEN RUN 2 MINUTE OFFENSE ALL GAME. ALL OF OUR BEST DRIVES THIS YEAR ARE BEN RUNNING THE OFFENSE.
Maybe a hot take but we are better with Ben
I want us to keep JuJu so bad
Lmao. They went 75 yards in 50 seconds.
Tomlin better shred this fucking secondary up. What the fuck are they doing back there?
They never overturn spot challenges but that spot was so bad this one will be
Why are we handing it off to Connor on 2nd and 19????
WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU RUN IT ON 2ND AND LONG
HOLY FUCK REFS
He held his arm the entire fucking time
That is fucking blatant DPI!!!!!!
"If the refs won't call PI, expect them to keep doing it."
im praying for a big turnover here. we really need it
"fuck it Houston, just foul us. refs are blind as shit"
TJ THAT MAN HAS A FAMILY
Mike hilton's got dollar signs in his eyes this year lmaooo
thank god he was down fumble out the endzone would be a turnover
claypool is a unit
"Claypool is love, Claypool is life."
For all the shit we give Fichtner I think that was a really great playcall from him
"Reading this game thread has been the text version of the ""they had us in the first half"" meme haha."
What was that stat before about the Texans winning a bunch if they have the lead going into the half?
wtf I never kneel on madden what are these coaches doing shake my smh
We've secretly replaced every Steelers receiver with Ike Taylor. Let's see if they notice.
"Redzone fg. Erggg

Also, Jaylen Samuels being in on 3rd and 1 is one thing. But running a delayed handoff out of shotgun on 3rd and 1 with Jaylen Samuels is another.

Randy, that was honestly just fucking stupid."
So I gotta say. I don’t think our secondary is the same as last year.
Blatant hold on Watt... Nice refs.
That drive looked way too easy for Houston.
Where had minkah been in the last 3 weeks
Holding on tj again
"""QB sneaks are too easy""

Every Steelers OC"
I feel like if James Harrison was chasing me I would at least make it across the street before stopping for a breather became a thought.
Where are the Juju haters now that Ben is back?
They scored in thirty fucking seconds
How the hell did our secondary go back to being SO awful when all the same guys came back???
"[For your halftime show, here's Roger wiping a booger on a girl with one leg.](https://gfycat.com/exhaustedsparsefennecfox)"
"When the offense does well, the defense shits the bed and vice versa. Both rarely play well in the same game."
"Secondary does not look good. Minkah is invisible. They can't rely on the pressure getting there every time, they're getting sliced up whenever Watson has time to throw.         

Also I know we're getting the ball back at the beginning of the second half, but come on, with 25 seconds we should've at least taken a shot or two downfield. Every point counts in what looks to be a shootout against a great offense"
"We’re down by 4, we get the ball back, and Tomlin has been very good at turning things around at half time. Let’s take a minute to appreciate that we aren’t the Rams and aren’t being blown out."
Remember: we’re the Pittsburgh Steelers. We’re not allowed to win challenges.
refs cant see shit
James “Donte Moncrief” Conner
"So many passes off hands...


Makes you appreciate Ward and Brown(who is unfortunately batshit crazy now)"
I'd like one turnover please. Thank you football God(s).
TJ is being held every play
Just held his fucking arm down
DPI WTF
Missed PI
He would have had the fucking catch if he had BOTH HIS MOTHER FUCKING HANDS
These refs are fucking ass
How is that not pass interference?
WTF. 21 was grabbing Claypool’s arm
Another week where the refs should lose their jobs.
I wonder if we can train an AI to make reffing calls. It could go rampant and still be better.
Nice of Watson to tell Hilton where he was throwing the ball.
Watson got a little too cute staying in bounds and got rocked
Defense please end them with a big pick
God xavier grumble flashbacks oh my god lol
[deleted]
"Ok. Prediction, Mike talks to BoB at half time. Trades JJ for 4 cases of Iron City, and JJ starts for us in the 2nd half."
Check 41 for roids. 1 man can't stop Vance
I know Huston has a terrible O line. But for fucks sakes our secondary still needs to play
Fuck deshaun and his guitar
Secondary blows. I was worried with how bad they looked against Daniel Jones and fucking Jeff Driskel so I'm not surprised Watson has carved them up.
Bro they are holding like crazy
I browsed 8 sites for divorce attorneys today
Who else thinks Randy Fichtner should be forced to smoke crack and pcp before each game so he isn’t so predictable?
God imagine if this team didn’t start so slow every game
See kids this is why we don't panic in the first quarter
We like wide open passes and things of that nature
I’m sorry but Steven Nelson looks awful this year so far.
Nelson looks like absolute trash today
Can we please have an offense and a defense at the same time? Like... just once?
Did we resign artie burns in the form of Steven Nelson?
Our secondary is buttcheeks this year.
I don't really care for the leagues decision to stop calling holding penalties this year. Is the offense not already at a huge advantage at all times with all the other rule chsnges? They need to gimp the teams that rely on a pass rush to succeed? Come on
Why the fuck did we keep going out of bounds with like 1:50 to go in their territory?
Anyone a little worried about Minkah?
He is half a yard passed the first down marker
Good challenge. We'll see where the ref's dart lands.
These refs fucking suck that spot was off by like 2 yards
2nd and 19. Let's run for 3 yards. Jesus fuck what?!?!
Fucking ridiculous decision to run on 2nd down
Way to take advantage of that nice punt return.
Offensive play calling is abysmal. Running on 2nd and 19 with this team is a bad decision. We don’t have Derrick Henry who can get 8 yards on any given play
DPI?!?!
Had his arm
HOLDING HIS WHOLE HAND
They refuse to call pass interference holy fuck dude
That was PI but Randy what the fuck are you doing. You get the ball at the 45 and get 2 yards. Worst OC in the league
Great pick. Also great hold on Watt that led to the pick instead of a sack
Holy shit watson got murdered
There has been some outrageous holding on TJ going uncalled
"1. Did the NFL get rid of holding calls? Seriously, I have to ask.


2.  DeShawn for protocol right? When you're slow to get up they have to take him under the tent right?"
Bens been overthrowing the fuck out of Claypool today
Melodramatic yinzers in shambles
Juju looking like Ward on these blocks
Nice! 2 points
END THIS FUCKING GAME DEFENSE COME ON I FUCKING BELIEVE IN YALL
I shrieked so loud at the TD my boyfriend thinks his ears ruptured
"What a phenomenal play call

Claypool is so dangerous"
"they are very close to breaking the 25 game streak of having a TO in a game

hope I didnt jink"
"Well I owe the D a big apology, way to step tf up!"
"That's a dub, ladies and gents.


See you next week for a another edition of ""I HATE EVERYTHING"" from this sub."
alot of no calls on tj this year

"Come on, secondary. We can’t get a sack on every down."

Ahhhh the ol’ run run pass punt. You hate to see it
Oh my God Dionte Johnson has some great moments but sometimes I really question his football IQ
Time for a signature 96 yard JuJu TD.
Wanna see me throw over ‘em mountains?
"I think after Cleveland cuts Baker.

He should keep doing the commercials. Except show him trying to break into the stadium."
The first quarter was The Vince Williams Show
Are we just not calling holding on TJ watt today?
Hey guys ready for another 3 and out??
What a great defense we have right? Best in the NFL right?
Does our secondary and Keith Butler know they’re allowed to cover their receivers? You don’t have to stay 5yds away from them at all times...
The holds on TJ are infuriating. I mean he obviously always gets held but these ones are ridiculous.
#R- E- L- A- X
I had zero hope Ebron was gonna catch that lmao
HANDS: RATED E FOR EBRON
EBRON CAUGHT THE BALL. OBVIOUSLY FIRE TOMLIN
Hilton is the best tackling corner in the nfl
Huh using the tight ends does something. Who would have thought.
Can we let Ben just always run the two minute offense no matter the time on the clock?
"“hah, I knew the Steelers would suddenly play completely differently unlike you reactionary idiots” -Cool Guy"
Holding isn’t a penalty this year. Just hug the lineman and let it be.
Cool cool baby shit soft D
Nelson regressed so hard
Nelson’s been garbage this year
VERY COOL VERY GOOD PLAYING.
Our secondary is really concerning.
I guess our defensive gameplan is to let Deshaun Watson develop fucking arthritis by torching our secondary so maybe he can't continue to dominate us in the 4th quarter!
I can’t believe the D couldn’t have closed out the half without points like Jesus
a blind monkey fucking a football could cover better than our secondary this year.
Brooke Pryor on twitter saying “looks like [TJ] is fine”
Really fucking bad spot... jesus
How can an official miss it by THAT much?!
"are these refs blind, they are constantly spotting it like a half yard to a yard behind where it was."
He literally smacked the ball down a half yard over it
GOOD CHALLENGE TOMLIN
What a horrible spot we shouldn’t even have to challenge that
Defense I'd like to order an apple turnover.
We're overdue for a turnover.
I'd be okay if ray ray took over pr full-time
RANDY YOU ABSOLUTE IDIOT!!!
Nothing like a run on 2nd and 19
His arm is being held the whole time?
Holy no call on the PI
How can you not see that holding? That's bs.
 Missed DPI

No harm, no foul. Young buck gotta be smarter than that."
We got lucky on the fumble there.
Of course Fichtner doesn’t cover his nose
Do we even need to run a play.  Can we just kneel down three times?
"DONT  BE PROUD, TAKE A KNEE FOR !"
Steelers had the ball for 11:50 of the game's final 13:27
"Man if we can beat this offense, I really like our chances against tennessee next week. Really loving this team so far this year"
"All you jumpers, complaining butts have to explain yourselves. You jump ship so quickly you weak willed fools. Stand beside your team."
"Well, if we are gonna be good for one half, I'll take the second half every time."
3-0 boys... see y’all next week
You have 24s and 2 timeouts. Try for fg range! Fuck
You all need to chill. We can't get a TD on every single drive. That drive looked clean and we got some points on the board.
Why in the hell didn’t we go for it on that 4th and 1? Damn it. Teams are just going to do a three to five step-back with their QB and do an air assault on our secondary all season long if they can’t fix it
What a blatant hold.. I know they intend to flag less holding calls but geez does he have to rip TJs helmet off first?
"Run, run, pass, punt. GIVE ME THE FUCKING PLAY-CALLING HOLY FUCK"
"Oh look, the return of the run, run, pass play sequence"
Every time DJ catches a punt it’s going to be something great or something absolutely terrible
So this will be the rude awakening game huh?
"secondary has been lacking all season, but still alot of game left to play"
"If I’m a coach this year I’m telling my whole o-line to hold on every play, refs aren’t calling it so why not"
Ya’ll need to calm down. It’s been 1 quarter.
That Houston defender trying to scissor kick the ball out of Ebron's hands lmao
"Alright defense, now we need you to get in the game."
"Man I've never seen one of our TEs do that. That's pretty hot. 

And they didn't call the clear holding by the defender lol."
Put your pitchforks and torches away. Stop overreacting in the 1st quarter.
I'm just so grateful to have Ben back. Last year a 14-3 deficit would've been an L. This year we actually have a chance.
Sometimes it's really gag worthy how far a network manages to crawl up its own ass when promoting itself.
Alright this is it time for a MAPLETRON TD
With a name like ray-ray McCloud you can only be good at football
Love the James Harrison commercial
17-14... id be drooling at halftime.
>WR Diontae Johnson is being evaluated for a possible concussion and his return is questionable.
Derek Watt out of the game  with a hamstring injury :(
"Fuck the announcer... ""TJ in on defense for Pittsburgh... but JJ always a factor for Houston'.   Like TJ wasn't the runner up to DPOY last year and not a factor?  Fucking dickhead"
Holy shit how did Juju get THAT open?
Fuckers better Pay JuJu
hot damn I love Ben & JuJu so much. Pay my boy JuJu in the offseason PLEASE
Can we stop playing zone now please thank you
This secondary looks bad.
"A QB Sneak banged Randy Fichtner’s wife, it’s the only explanation"
3 yards to the first? Let’s throw it for 50+ yards!
That’s 100% a first down
Holy shit guys we might win a challenge
I think that's actually a good challenge
He had that by a mile!
Can’t wait to see how we get fucked out of this one
The Virgin short gain vs the Chad 30+ Yard penalty
Alejandro was just trying to find a flag to salute downfield
I feel so drained watching Steeler games. It's always close when it shouldn't be and it's too stressful.
"God it looked bad live,but on the replay it was even worse of a drop"
Houston should feel happy?  I would be upset at any points on their side... they gave up two 4th down conversions after being GIFTED that challenge
Holy shi...ok McCloud
Nothing says “I want to win” like a  2nd and 19 draw play.
"need 19 yards?  run right up the middle.

FUCK YOU FICHTNER"
Colquitt has been incredibly underwhelming
Smh running on 2nd and 19
Run on 2nd and 19. The standard is the standard!!!!!!
"Tuitt is like, fuck this I'll do it myself."
REFS ARE FUCKING BLIND HOLY SHIT
You can just hold his arm like that?
Uhhhh can you legally hold on to an arm of a reciever
Blatant pass interference
Big surprise...Dupree comes around when he has a legitimate counterpart in Watt.
"I swear, it’s like our defense plays phenomenal on 1st and 2nd downs then just says fuck it on 3rd"
Defense comes through
PAY MIKE HILTON FFS
LETS GO HILTON
THE STREAK CONTINUES!!
Thank God for Watt
THERE WE FUCKING GO BABY!!! HILTON YOU SEXY SON OF A BITCH!!!
"Watson is a very mobile quarterback. D-line is getting penetration, but Watson is looking good extending plays. Really great to get that pick. Hopefully we can capitalize."
"3 straight outstanding drives by the D (with one bad pass play given up) holding the Texans to 0 points.

Offense needs to stop fucking around and take advantage of this."
I hope the Steelers end this drive by scoring a touchdown.
Lets go Connor I know you still got it!
JAMES FUCKING CONNER IS HUNGRY LIKE THE WOLF!!
Loving how Conner is running today
Everything EXACTLY as we needed on that drive
HERE WE FUCKING GO
AND THE 2 POINT??? Is not even my birthday yet!
TJ out-Watting JJ today.
I'm just glad he didn't fumble that through the end zone.
Well he is damn lucky but still NICE PLAYCALL!
MAPLETRON
Their defense is exhausted. Steelers got 35 min ToP already
The Offense finally clicked boys!
"While obviously it still would have been bad if that had gone through the end zone, Claypool continues to show how good his awareness is because his sole focus going down was trying to save that ball."
"Last time we started 3-0 we won the Super Bowl. I hope this team stays healthy so they can keep this chemistry going and continue to develop. 

Titans next week gonna be dope."
Tomlin haters getting ready to eat crow.
We don't do comfortable wins and things of that nature.
UNDEFEATEDDDDDDD
"Yikes, that gave me flashbacks to Grimble vs Broncos"
how do you even give up a td in 40 seconds? you have to be trying to be that bad
"Gonna be a close game, can’t wait for the yinzer overreactions every time the Texans get a first down, including my own"
I need me a birthday win. COME ON BOYS!!!
Best believe I'm already drunk in order to get through this game! Steelers 27 - Texans 20 book it!
They call dpi on other teams?!
"Juju is the ultimate grinder, the man isn't always flashy but he gets those extra yards whichever way he can"
"""Pittsburgh has gone 20 straight games without a score on an opening drive.""

..."
so weird not hearing the crowd on a PI call
"Running out of the shotgun. 


Isn't that one of the things we hate? Lol"
If you're gonna run it just give it to Connor???
You have Conner as your power back and you run it with Samuels. No wonder we never score a TD on an opening drive.
"WHY SAMUELS!!!!!!!!!!

it was all working and they got fancy with your worst RB"
"Somethings wrong with our secondary, idk if it's the scheme or what but there's a BIG difference between now and last year"
Get Vince Williams off of Brandin Cooks Jesus Christ
"Ah the ok run, run, pass, punt offense...ugh.."
Vintage 96 yard Juju TD incoming
How is that not PI. That’s definitely catchable regardless of where it lands
"Alright Ben, we get it. You can still throw deep. Can you just get a first down?"
What. The. Fuck. Are. We. Doing.
"I don’t want to be pounding beers at 1:40pm, but here we are!"
That was a great punt! Past the 50 and enough hang time to allow the guys to get down there. Awesome
[deleted]
Randy Fichtner and Keith Butler need to go. I don’t think they’re good enough to win a Super Bowl
What a fucking hit Vince
"One day we gonna dominate a game, not today, but one day"
6 DBs and still pass for the 1st lol. What a joke
Uncalled holding on that
Nothing like TJ getting tackled!
This is fucking bullshit. TJ is getting held so badly
TJ getting held every play lmao
Dude the holding is so bad you can see handfuls of jersey
Hey can we maybe stop with the zone D?
Allow me to reiterate: this secondary is fucking trash.
where the hell is our pass coverage. watson is killing us. he's marched down the field multiple times.
Why does this feed look so bad after a quarter and a bit of football. Jesus Christ if you don’t have something nice to say don’t say it at all.
Juju is looking more like Hines Ward every day. Great blocking by him.
Mcfarland is so much faster than conner its disgusting
I personally believe there isn't anything wrong with Ben or the offense. I think it's more of a play calling issue. I swear they only want to start playing ball and looking good when they're down on the scoreboard. Otherwise they are completely lackadaisical. It's EXTREMELY frustrating.
BEN WITH THE CUT BLOCK!
BEN WITH A FUCKING BLOCK
BEN WITH THE BLOCK!!!!
THAT WAS 100% BEN RIGHT THERE! WHAT OTHER 38 YR OLD QB IS THROWING BLOCKS ON A 270 POUND LB
NO WAY THIS WORKED 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That block from Ben. Put him in the secondary he can do it all
Diontae Johnson is headed to the locker room (not sure if it was mentioned on TV - I heard it from Missy Matthews)
Flashbacks to last week when we killed Lock on that sack.
I want more McFarland.
Pretty sure 18 is being evaluated for a concussion
Really not a fan of just running twice there
Derek Watt hurt and Dionte is getting checked for concussion. FUCK ME MAN
"Everyone is talking about holding on watt.


I'm still pissed when we played byron leftwich and the jags and they held the shit out of us on a 3rd and long and byron ran for a first to seal the game.


Fucking holding!"
"Really wish we’d bring in some young, fiery OC."
WE HAVE A LEAD! Now can all the people crying please relax? And we get the ball back after half
things have turned around ever since I changed my shirt to the one I was wearing the opening game
He ran harder to his celebration spot that into the endzone.
See I told you pessimistic fucks.. Fair weathers coming back all excited all the sudden fuck off. You’re either here for the team or you’re not.
Okarafor solidifying his starting job at RT forever
Josh Allen sneaky top 10
This Secondary man. What was that
"Wtf happened to our secondary, we didn't lose anyone from last year."
d-defense? b-b-best in the l-l-league? h-hello?
WTF IS THIS DEFENSE?!?!
Either a sack or we give up 20+ every time.
"What in the fuck are we doing on defense here, we just needed to keep them down for a minute."
"5 plays, 75 yards, 50 seconds. Pretty fucking tough to give up a TD drive that quickly."
Is it the scheme or the players?
The secondary is looking mighty suspect.
Offenses playing against the Steelers defense have not been called for holding this year.
Can the D put together a better game plan during halftime?
45 seconds right down the fucking field
Nelson sucks so bad this year. What the hell??
"If our defense plays like this against Baltimore, we will be blown out."
Who needs 3 points. Fuck it. Take a knee.
Fuck you Butler !!! Great defensive play calling you schmuck
"Why not try to do something, at least just let Ben heave it there, but no, we'll just kneel with 24 seconds left."
2 time outs and take 0 shots at the end zone
Jeff Driskel did the same shit to us
"Better see some actual half time adjustments. If this team truly wants to make it far, let's see they're willing to get out of their stubborn ways."
I would like Coach to do locker room speeches so we can start kicking ass again
Steelers defense has gotten really close to getting home on a number of occasions - I honestly think there is a small element of bad luck there. What concerns me more is the regression of the secondary - especially Nelson.
"$50 we come out doing run, run, pass"
"The Secondary is not playing as fast as usual.
But that's not the only problem. 

We're playing soft zone defense and Deshaun is tearing us apart. We have to play more aggressive man coverage."
Roethlisberger pointing out the fucking spot is the energy I needed today
"Ben ""Wheels"" Roethlisberger"
He got that
That was a bad spot
BEN WITH THE STIFF ARM
Oh shit a Tomlin challenge...
Ben is pure fucking speed
Bad fucking spot
refs dislike us today it kinda seems o.o
That's a Ben that wants to win.
He absolutely got that
Give that big man his first down he worked hard for that.
Spot challenges are so damn risky. But I think he was there
He's easily a half yard over
Ben’s face with that stiff arm has to be a meme later
Wow... thats a shit call.  Game doing the fucking FREEZE FRAME on his knee down and the ball at the first or maybe JUST shy by an inch.
These refs are embarrassing for that challenge and that PI lmaooo
Catch the fucking ball
This drive went to shit
Thank god for Bos at least
Catch the fucking ball
"Guess we're feeding Bosgod again.

We can't keep fizzling out in the redzone like this."
Thank you Houston for running the ball twice
"We love 3 yard runs on 2nd and 19, don’t we, folks?"
Ok...why would you play a draw play on 2nd and 19 with a future HOF QB?
These play calls are Adam Gase type shit
This is why we all call for fichtners head every year lol
"I feel like the call came into Ben as ""run it up the middle for 20""."
Should have been PI... FUCKERS... they called that shit on us all day last week.
I guess you can hold onto a WR's arm now?
Jesus there's swallowing whistles and there's these refs. Are we sure there are actually refs in the stadium?
"I'll say it again, fuck these refs"
Looks like the Texans remembered they can pass on us at will.
Trash refs.
"Oh shit.


Watt drilled Watson"
Big tiny Mike Hilton!
Watt held that whole play holy shit. I'm losing it guys. My neighbors have got to hate me now
What could go wrong pointing at who your throwing at
Just let Ben be the fucking OC. Randy can just chill.
This has been a huge game for ebron
When the offense is clicking they're dangerous. Please more of them kind of drives.
🅱️ONNER STRONG
Jesus JuJu... i REALLY would have loved you keeping that held tight through the ground... cause I hate trusting Refs on anything catch related \~\_\~
"God Conner is the most ""when he's good he's great, and when he off, he's infuriating"" running back for me I love him right now though"
HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE
"I'm not going to exaggerate at all.

WE HAVE THE BEST PULLING GUARDS IN THE NFL."
"Alright defense let's show the fuck up, give it back to the offense, and run this motherfucker out."
I love watching the fanbase’s opinion on Conner change so much every half hour
Juju's just been quietly doing the dirty work this year. They gotta get him a nice little ten yard in route or something so he can work with some space
TJ has already won the Watt bowl
i feel like conner never tries to dodge anything. he always just runs straight ahead and hopes for the best
Wait... Did we just call the right play???
I still fucking hate the touchback rule
"Claypool showing up at the last minute but showing up nonetheless!! 

See ya Texans!! 3-0 boys!! Victory pre-roll!!"
Houston is a complete team. A win here is really good
"Ayo claypool almost made me shit myself, all good tho"
Joe Burrow is on the ground every other play in the Bengals game. He is not going to last if the Bengals don't protect him.
"Buckle up everyone, Browns have a positive record for the first time in over a decade."
Once again reminded of that god awful fumble out of the end zone rule.... but luck might actually be on our side today
The defense had an amazing second half
"TJ and Derek : ""So... mom officially loves us more now"""
"So excited with how the team has started this season. Up the Steelers, never doubted the win today!"
Here we go steelers here we goooooooo!!!!!!!
I said it and I'll say it again. Our Secondary is looking mighty suspicious
"As soon as I bought a Minkah jersey he lost his superpowers. All my fault, everyone."
Who’s worried?
"I said this when it was 14-3:

The only thing l'm going to say is good teams battle back from bad starts. They make adjustments and improve over the course of a game. The next 2 hours will determine if we are a good team. hope the answer is yes. Because so far it hasn't been.

... I think we can say we are a good team now."
LETS GOOOOOO
"16 years as a Steelers fan has taught me to never be confident or comfortable about ANY game. So I'll *hope* we win, but I'll *believe* we'll win when there's 30 seconds left and we're up by 10"
if we can continue to play D like that we’ll win
Offense is churning nicely this drive
"We actually didn’t start with the classic run, run, throw 3 and out this game. Incredible"
Jaylen as a third down back? Huh ?
21 straight games without an opening drive touchdown 😭🤦🏽‍♂️
"Steelers figured everybody plays the pass with samuels on the field, the got too fancy there.

just run it up the damn middle behind your all pro C and G"
Oh don't start this shit
Middle has been wide open for 6 years now I swear.
TJ held like a newborn baby
Alright Fit Ben time for the deep ball.
"Run, Run, Pass - Zero ingenuity"
We were doing so good and you default back to the run run pass fuck off fichtner
The more desperate team is going to win today.
"texans: 0-2 after playing two of NFL's best teams
Steelers: 2-0 after playing two of NFL's worst teams. could be a reality check for both teams"
Diontae returning punts is goddamned roller coaster
"Fumbles too much, dumb enough to fair catch at the 4. Get him the hell off punts, don’t care how shifty he is."
Ya all miss switzer now??
Diontae is not very intelligent
"Why does Johnson continue to return punts? He's, like, an idiot back there. Fair catch inside the 5? The fuck?"
Diontae is such a boom or bust on punt returns. He'll either make a boneheaded play or a huge return.
This is gonna be an ugly game..
I missed Ben’s bombs down the field. But I only miss them when they are completed.
Jesus Bince he has a family man
Odd play calls so far
"Bince might be a one trick pony, but that trick is really satisfying to watch."
I don't get how teams can watch the Patriots dynasty running the same 4 high percentage plays for two decades and not attempt the same thing.
Tj is being held every single down
I still believe in us.
Our 3rd Down defense is trash
We really need a td on the next drive if only to restore our confidence
If we don’t get something going on offense this next drive then we might get killed. Defense clearly isn’t going to win us this game so it’s up to Ben and the offense to take it into their own hands.
Minkah officially looking bad. This guy needs to make a play
This discussion thread is absolute cancer lol
I’ve been to most other NFL subs and can confirm that they’re all just as cancerous when their team is down.
id suck a fat d1ck for 10-14
i hate that new rams logo so much
BIG BEN WITH THE BLOCK
Great block Ben!
Ben trying to lay the wood
Ben with the block
Chase is too big to not be in here.
WELCOME TO PITTSBURGH YOU CUTE FUCK
Ebron caught that!
A long sustained drive. That’s what I’m talking about!
EBRON COMING THROUGH CLUTCH!! FUCK YES BABY!!
Been waiting for them to unleash Ebron
EXACTLY what was needed. Defense finally rested and got the touch.
If we could just not give up more points until the half that would be great
"Alright Minkah, I smell a tip pass coming your way"
"Ok so if we hold the Texans to nothing until half, this is a totally different game"
Stilllll holding TJ
Did Diontae return? Looked legit shook up after that hit in the reverse
>FB Derek Watt has a hamstring injury. His return is questionable to today's game.
"Aw, man. Poor Derrick."
I am so sick of running in first and second.
"Ebron is just a skinny lineman playing TE, dude is huge"
Conner is looking good today
NOBODY WAS NEAR HIM
WE GET THE BALL BACK AT HALFTIME TOO LETS GO
Woohoo! That's my quarterback and that's my receiver!
JU JU!!! you making me see our super bowl chances are [TRU-TRU](https://i.imgur.com/wrIKDh9.gif)
How can we drop seven and STILL leave guys open??
Our secondary has more soft spots than a baby's head
This steelers d looking real weak rn
Right. Down. The. Field.
Holy shit how did they March down the field that fast
Goddamn just letting them walk down the field.
"It's like every time people start to take us seriously we do stuff like this and show why they shouldn't.

Our secondary is looking like dogshit today."
Wonder how our 20 second offense is
Yeah I actually thought we'd go into halftime with a lead
"This secondary is really, really bad right now. Whatever issues they have they need to correct fast. I'm not expert enough to know if its scheme or talent but they fuckin suck."
Man what happened to our D? Come on boys!
Defense looks not good right now
Just when I thought my blood pressure was going down.. they pull me back in
How is the defense so inconsistent? Every drive has been 3 and out or fucking easy drive for td. That’s so fucking bad
"With this pass defense, who cares if you have a good run defense if teams never have to run against you."
It's even more painful to know that this is what we're gonna have to deal with the rest of the year. Because you know that no changes are gonna be made to the scheme
This zone shit has to stop
"Ben with the forward kneel, making sure he keeps those rushing yards."
"Never thought I'd say it this year, but we need the offense to bail out the defense."
Why can't the fucking offense and defense click at the same time?
Gonna need a lot more than 26 to win today
Nelson has sucked this year must have slacked during the off-season
Damn some of those streams must be very far behind lol
God he's just sailing these long balls man
Bruh these guys are open deep. Ben is just overthrowing them by miles
He got that
Hit em with the big stiff arm lmao
Good challenge
Ben with that Dad strength.
He has it by a yard easy
Ben’s accuracy is suspect
Two shitty sets of refs in a row. Aren’t these guys like trained for months and shit
FLACCO SPECIAL
Horrible play call but I’ll take the penalty lol
BALL DONT LIE
Ben's deep ball has not been pretty.
What a bad play call on 4th and inches.
"This is a bad string of calls, makeup call... and now another makeup call because the makeup call was a bad call..."
2 terrible calls in a row lmfao
Should have been 7. With how our secondary is getting torched 3’s won’t win it
Right in the hands lol
Catch the fucking ball
"Ben, less pepper. WAY less pepper. Ffs"
Can’t be getting field goals when our defense allows tds in 40 secs.
CATCH THE FUCKING BALL
I can’t wait for this next Texans drive where they successfully target Nelson every play.
Ray Ray got wheels
"Thankfully our defense showed the fuck up.

Let's get a damn touch down offense!!"
Solid tackle by Edmunds
its a shame terrell is so fuckin shit at coverage because hes above average in run defense.
"That's it, I love McCloud. Switzer (as hard as does try at least) would have been in the dirt on that one but this guy made it into a decent return"
McCloud runs like he thinks that at any point in time he may have to run through a brick wall and I love it.
"Instead of Killer Bees we got Big Macs? Vance, Ray Ray and Anthony? Does it work? If not I'll see myself out."
Ray Ray is a grown ass man
Run play on 2nd and 19?? ARE WE GIVING UP ON THE DRIVE DUDE THE FUCKKKK IS THIS
2nd and 19? Let’s give it to Glass Connor. Great playcalling...
This game is making me remember how much I hate Randy Fichtner
It’s Randy Fichtner’s world and we’re just livin in it
It's almost like they should have actually fucking tried on second down so the third isn't so hard.
Need 16yds and we run a 15yd route 👌🏼
WHERES THE FUCKING FLAG ON TEXANS 42 on the kick?
I would love to see a play action pass (not a screen) at some point this season. I would also love us to go no huddle at some point. We used to do these things with some frequency.
Thanks a lot Feiler
The worst part of the run on 2nd & 19 was that it wasn't even a draw.
We ain't winning football games without takeaways.
hell yeah tuitt!!!
Uh oh Bens hurtin. Ben dropping 300 yards and 4TDs this half.
So just hold his arm the whole time. Cool
refs are so fucking bad
Wow thats hella PI lol
Man that would’ve been a hell of a catch
Ummm. Refs?
these refs need to be beat
Our inability to score TDs in the redzone is really the story. If we lose I blame that.
Edmunds just loafing around in no man’s land
TJ getting sick of this shit lol
That’s what we fucking needed!!! TD next CMON!!!
Watsons definitely hurt
Hilton is a fucking STUD
Anyone else notice how jacked Jake from state farm is?
"So it’s week 3, two injured QBs, and we still have to play the Bengals twice still. I feel bad for Burrow."
"“YOU GONNA HOLD ME? FINE. ILL GET EROUND THE OUTSIDE AND COOK YOUR ASS LATER.”

-TJ"
"Taking off the homer glasses for a second, Watson is playing really really well. He reads the pocket well, scrambles well, can make most of the throws... Its been impressive. Lots of people here shouting at our secondary, but it is pretty darn difficult to cover zone when the QB can extend for that long and make throws across your body.   
It makes me fear Ravens a lot."
Feel bad for the dude who was happy he benched ebron in fantasy.
"I hate the Browns, but man Chubb is a fucking beast."
Vance refrigeration back in business
McDonald: Puny defense.
8 points would be so fucking huge right now
James Conner!!!
Give juju half that touchdown. That block was CLUTCH
"No hesitation on that run, just a missile."
NO MORE JC SLANDER
That’s the kind of drive I want to see from this offense!!! Everyone contributed
BIG CATCH JUJU
Juju with the pure class block there
LETS FUCKING GO BOYS NOW D UP LETS GET THIS DONE
Hold it down defense and get Ben that ball back
D has to make a stand. Let's go!
Hell of a drive boys. Way to execute for the TD and Two points. Defense needed that break! LETS GO BOYS
Nice block JuJu
AHHHHHHHH LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
28 Points is more than they scored in any game last year.
oh mama i'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
JJ on the sideline watching the new model outperform him.
This TJ Watt is pretty good
Our team is so strange.  Third and long on defense is always risky.  Third and short on offense is low succes.
"so glad they went for it, would had been a tough fg"
That was... dark
If that went out of the end zone I would’ve cried
"Perfect play calling, this drive has been magical"
That was dangerously close to a touchback.
C L E N C H.
BRO THAT WAS SCARY AF
THANK GOD
Thank fuck that wasn’t a fumbled out of the end zone bullshit
Just take 3 knees
I want another score just so we can get over 30 points for the first time since 2018
"Gotta give the defense props for stepping up big time in the second half. The offense finding more consistency really helped as well. Once we can put it together for a full 60, we'll be tough to beat!"
"I thought, with Texans being 0-2, this would be the game we let slip.  Glad to be wrong.

I think Ben is primed to make a run."
We haven’t scored 30 since 12/2/18 against the Chargers.
Second half defense brought it and offense clicked 4th quarter
3-0 biitttcheesss
our secondary just doesn’t compare to our d-line and linebacker core
3rd and 10??  More like 3rd and BEN!!!!
Not even gonna take a shot? Randy you fucking coward.
Wait aren't we losing?? Shouldn't we have tried something there
These passes aren't perfect but they should still be caught. Holy fk.
This dude is so much better than Switzer when it comes to punts
So far I'm loving RayRay wayyy more than Diontae on returning punts
[deleted]
"Please lord, let them not blow this turnover on 2 runs, 1pass, punt BS...."
"Blow it up fire all coaches and coordinators, trade everyone for draft picks. Ben is washed up/trash, defense is overrated. Our season is over./s

Where are all the folks saying this stuff in the second quarter? Go Steelers!"
"Two things are going to happen:


1. We're going to win this game.


2. Haters on this sub will bitch about it in every way possible.


Ride or die."
"Ben hits a guy in the hands
Some people in this sub : BEN AND TOMLINS FAULT"
Jesus can they cram any more commercials into this
If Fitzpatrick doesn't get his shit together the FO's gonna turn around and give his money to Juju.
Conner has dropped balls that Bell would've caught... I miss him 🥺
"I can’t stand Randy. On 2nd and 19 why don’t you call a quick in, out, or slant so then you’ll have a manageable 3rd down😃😃"
Lets have a healthy win here. Bless the knees
"LET'S GOOO! 

P.S. I miss the Tomlin grinning face flair that used to be here"
Won't be able to watch the game since my buddy is getting married. Have to settle listening to the Steelers radio. Let's go! Here is to 3-0
"Chinese food is on hand, dogs and myself are in jerseys, the good weed is ground up and ready to rock for kick off, victory pre-roll on stand by, 120 ounce water jug refilled with ice and refreshing water.

Let's fucking do this."
I want the Steelers to win
"omg leaving TJ unblocked on the first play of the game 

the balls on HOU"
Im liking the play calling so far
juju is hines ward 2.0
Chill out on ebron yall that bell was below his knees 3 ft behind him
"THATS WHAT I WANNA SEE FROM CONNOR, FUCK YEA"
"I love ben not forcing deep shots, just taking what theyre giving us"
Fucking beautiful seeing an actual check down in action instead of immediately going straight for the check down option.
Why not give it to Conner to pick up the first?
What a weird playcall on 3rd and 1
That's a good first drive. If we keep on pushing the ball but hopefully end with TDs we'll win.
Just hate these shotgun runs we continue to get stuffed on
That shite run call disrespects the supreme Juju effort to get the first down and keep the drive moving.
Texans have serious speed outside that’s gonna be an issue. Crossers against man is gonna kill is
Why was Vince covering cooks
Like a knife through warm butter
Bruh why did they not call holding
I really don't have a good feeling about this game
wheres minkah at
Where’s Fitz? Dudes been a ghost this season so far. I’m thinking that Butler has tightened the game plan because we have an offense this year. Stop that.
[deleted]
Ok.  Fuck this.  Everytime I wear a jersey we play like hot garbage.  I'm taking it off.  Sorry guys.
Banner is my eligible receiver. Get better soon big guy.
Run. Run. Pass. You think opposing teams will figure it out? /s
I was really confused when we didn’t start the game with two runs up the middle and then a sack. I’m much more comfortable now.
"Run Run Pass, never saw it coming 🥴"
Hilton is iffy at best in coverage but holy shit he is by far one of the best blitzers and solo tacklers we have.
Good defensive series there. Gotta get pressure on Watson.
Who calls for a fair catch that close to the end zone???
What in the hell lol its like I'm watching a madden game
Offense looking like doodoo
Only need 7? Better throw a deep ball. Ffs
Another week of questioning over half of the offensive play calling... and it being a butt clenching close game the entire time it seems.
"Wtf Ben, just throw for 8 yards.  Stop overthrowing downfield and killing our field position"
Ben finna blow that new elbow out with these overthrows
🅱️INCE
"I'm not worried about the slow offensive start. I think we'll figure it out. Has to be hard on Ben to be playing with so many new characters after a whole season off. 

But I want our play calling to be better to help them gel."
Our secondary is so ass that we literally shut down every single teams running game and we still get torched KNOWING they have to pass
God damm we fucking suck today
Why is everyone so wide open
Has Minkah played this year?
Our secondary is good for allowing 2-3 20 yard completions on every opposing drive
Why aren't they calling holding? I'm not sure if I've seen it this year
Bush getting it done!
Another 3rd and long where we flubbed the zone coverage...
Remember when the defense was good
Bush 100% saved a TD there
Classic Steelers. Go down by 11 and the start playing for real.
Defense can’t get off the field. Offense can’t stay on the field. It’s going to end with us losing by more than 15.
[deleted]
Highsmith didn't set the edge. Oof
What the hell is going on with our secondary? It should not be that much of a liability anymore
calm down everyone the game isn’t over
"If the offense is going to keep putting the defense back on the field after 3 & outs, this is going to be really ugly. Houston start their drives almost near midfield every time."
WHY ARE WE PLAYING ZONE??!!! The Texans WR are not that good I really don’t get it
[deleted]
“fire tomlin” incoming
Glad I'm working and not able to watch.
Wondering how many more times TJ Watt gets tackled before there’s a holding call.
"The only thing I'm going to say is good teams battle back from bad starts. They make adjustments and improve over the course of a game.

The next 2 hours will determine if we are a good team.

I hope the answer is yes. Because so far it hasn't been."
I love MacFarland man lol he's gonna be so good long term
Thank you for using McFarland
McFarland runs like a chicken with its head cut off
Mcfarland is so damn fast
Calm down everyone. There are 40 minutes left in this game. Let's go Steelers.
You guys are honestly the hardest fans to listen to when it’s not going our way. Be a fan not a fucking critic.
Nice block Ben!
BEN WITH THE BLOCK
BEN WITH THE LEADING BLOCK 💪
Lol Ben throwing a block
Damn that Snell run opposite the FB was actually a really good call
I just went from frustrated to happy so fast I think I got whiplash
I thought ebron was shit and needs to be cut?
Fine... do it the hard way... fucking showoff Ben
Great play to Ebron for the TD!!
That’s a fucking drive!!!!!
What a throw by Ben & an even better catch by Ebron. That's what he was brought in to do
And good throw
LETS GOOOOOOOO
"Ok, now its time for the D to show their stuff.  The secondary needs to tighten up and get a turnover."
"So anyone know how that grounding was grounding?  I am not in the mood to look up very specific rules... but I was raised with 'if you throw it through the back of the endzone, its never grounding'."
Is CBS fucking with me right now with no Ray Liota with Chantix?
Still holding tj
Hilton never misses tackles man
Watt/Dupree 2020
Everyone gonna chill the fuck out now?
OH HILTON MY HILTON
Jesus that punt tho
Ray Ray got us about 8 yards more than Fair catch Switz
Ray Ray.  Nice to have a return man that is actually capable.   Been a long time coming.
That punt almost went into fuckin orbit
Diontae being evaluated for a concussion as per Missi Matthews
Conner showing off all those muscles just to get touched and go straight to the ground...
"JUJU!!!!, SHOUTOUT TO CHUKS FOR PLAYING LIGHTS OUT RIGHT NOW"
"Wow busted coverage

JUJU!!!!!!"
I'll take that blown coverage
JUJU!!!
Juju!!!!
FIT BEN TO JUJU BABY!!!
Texans ran away from JuJu like he was Hopkins
Duuude I was like Juju baby why you walking?
"# I TOLD YALL TO RELAX

We got this 💪"
Hope Dionte is ok. I think we’ll be seeing more Claypool the second half of he can’t come back in. We may get to see what the kid can really do.
Overreactions help turn the tide.
"""Ben is too old and the defense is hot trash."""
Can’t believe he literally walked in lol
We get the ball to open second half
uhh wait defense it isnt halftime yet!
Oh come on now... don't give up a free field goal to end the half
Tj being held on literally every fucking play is driving me nuts
Our zone coverage is awful. Or was that terrible man?
1 turnover please to thank
EVERY time we blitz we get pressure. Fucking. Blitz.
I mean who likes a lead? Why carry one into half?
Oh come the fuck on guys... Just fucking hold 'em for three.
That drive was too easy good lord
Defense is just completely deflating is rn
Holy Christ D...
WHY DOES LOOK LIKE OUR DEFENSE IN 2018?????
Nelson... pls
Did Nelson just not want to even try to jump and defend that?
i don’t understand how there are so many no calls on tj
"need to start getting that pressure in faster and secondary needs to clamp down. watson is getting the ball off way to quickly, need to keep those receivers covered tighter just a little longer"
Does Nelson have Watson on his fantasy team?
that was the most predictable thing ever sadly
If we lose this game that texans drive is the defining moment of the game.
Why the fuck we just waste it
"alright i can only say its fine so many times.

&#x200B;

what the actual fuck was that. watsons an amazing qb but we should be able to guard cooks, cobb, and fuller. this is so bad"
Defense is in shambles.
We'd be up by 14 if we incorporated bubble screens. You know it's true!
The defense has did the complete opposite of what they did previous 2 weeks
Anyone thinking its gonna come out soon that Minkah is playing hurt?  This much regression makes no fucking sense to me.
Like do they tell the secondary that the middle of the field is made of lava or something in practice.
Those reality shows are trash.
If we come out this half in fucking zone..
It's weird how hard it is for us to convert on third and one.
Ben with these adrenaline deep balls
Claypool would have caught that but Fichtner is being a fucking moron.
Ummmm are we going to talk about how that bomb to Washington was COMPLETELY catchable???
I think Ben got it with the extend
challenge that
Ben is mobile lmao
He absolutely got it
Clearly a first down
Captain FastFuck? UrinatingTree is gonna love this play
Ben looking like Josh Allen out there
Ben thicc and quikkkkkkk
That's a first
That’s a good challenge. Ben got that
Ben is a graceful gazelle
"are we gonna win a challenge on Big ""Legs"" Rothlesburners?!"
"Kind of embarrassing that needed to be challenged really. It was well past the line to gain, and there wasn't anything unclear about that in real time."
LOL so everyone is fucking blind. OK!
Did sonic just have a commercial for ice
"No holding calls at all, and a bullshit lost challenge? Fucking trash refs"
That’s honestly fucking horrible what the absolute fuck! How in the hell is that not a COMPLETELY DEFINITIVE result
KARMA FUCKER
Good job Chase
4th and inches? Throw to the endzone
"God I wish charles davis would just shut his fucking mouth for 2 seconds. I know it's his job, but he's bad at it"
"Idk about that call, but good play by Claypool to get the flag."
The ol’ Flacco special
These drops are killing me
CATCH THE BALL. MAKE GOOD PASSES.
Ben's not hitting guys in stride very much at all
"3rd & goal, 15 out? Well fuck us."
Sweet hands conner
"You're right, I do not feel good about this"
Now we have to watch this secondary 🤢
"Yup, a penalty and two dropped passes will end a drive for ya"
Is our defense going to hold them to 3 and out?
"Good stop, big return.


Big Mo on our side"
Excellent return
We got a returner here fellas
"Absolute huge dick play from RayRay, that hit should’ve rocked him and he shrugged it off like it was fucking nothing"
Good stand for the D. Maybe that last drive of the 1st half embarrassed them.
"Oh good, run on second and 18, but not first or second and 10"
2nd and 19.....and you run it?
"2nd and 19, better run it up the middle..."
A run on 2nd & 19. lol
"And there's the ""give up the drive altogether"" 2nd down inside run lol"
I love that we decide to run on 2nd and 19. There’s NO chance we can convert so we may as well waste this possession am I right guys?
What a joke
Shoulda gone for it
colquitt has been less than underwhelming so far
"I don't mind running on second and surprising them, but it can't be Conner. Idk why he runs through the center every run. Should of brought in Mcfarland."
"Just fire Fichtner and have Ben call all his own plays. Or hell, crowdsource them. Literally cannot be worse. “Twitch plays NFL” anyone?"
Watt gets held every play. So annoying
Was that a tiki bar-boat?
Doit tuitt
A torn titty would suck.
"please, we need a td here. come on"
"Best field position of the day, 3 and out"
Such obvious PI
Not gonna call that DPI? Literally holding Claypools hand.
ben 15/27 jesus.  with 6 drops.
How was there not a flag?!
Lamarr Woodley for the TFL...sorry...not used to Highsmith yet.
We need a turnover so badly
Anyone got a replay on the Claypool no call?
TJ has been getting held all damn day. He got tackled on that one and no flag.
ANOTHER TJ WATT HOLD fuck man
FINALLY A PICK
HILTON
OH COME ALLL YEEE FAAAAAITHFUL
[deleted]
MIKE HILTON!
finally a turnover
LET’S GO D!!
Nice work D!!!!!!!!!
HILTON YOU MAGNIFICENT BASTARD
Let's gooooo hilton
Tj watt makes that play right after he was held and blocked in the back. This man is a legend
That no call on Watt is a makeup call for not calling him being choked all game
I love picks when the guy who picks it just comes out of nowhere
Turned on renegade for a little pump up and we got an interception. Coincidence? I think not 💪💪
I think Ben really misses Health Miller... because Ebron is getting the same type of play calls he did unlike with Vance.
Time to get that Ebron Jersey
Is it just me or is Conner always looking around for the hit rather than running when he breaks through the first tackle?
Oh no here comes 3rd and short
Ben with the absolute missile way overthrown lol
CONNORRRR
"James conner rushing TD



Stillers goin to a super bowl"
Atta boy James!
JUJU
"JAMES FUCKING CONNOR

JUJU BLOCKING SCHUSTER"
Let's sink that 2 point conv too!
JuJu with that Heinz Ward like blocking..ya love to see it.
Let’s go boys
Nice block by juju there on the TD
Did he catch it?
I admit I was a bit down on Conner in Week one.  He looks good today.
PLZ DFense
Thought that was a drop lol
"Wow that was a truly impressive drive, well done, let’s gooooooo!"
We got 2! Wooooooooo!
Mmmm steeler schizophrenia
Safe to say we made some adjustments at the half. Let's GO.
Man TJ getting all those fourth quarter sacks and fumbles last year is why I wish he got DPOY. He makes big plays when it matters all the time
Long drive boys......long drive please
Soak this clock and kick a field goal and I'll be happy
"3rd and 26, ya love to see it. 

Time to torch that clock."
3rd and long and no BS PI call? It’s a miracle.
JAMES FUCKING CONNER
A little off topic but... You literally can't see shit through these camera setting. Either let me see more than 5 players at a time or don't charge a month worth of salary for fucking game pass come on..
Fuck sake. We always wanna do this the hard way
I fucking LOVE that play. Ben must’ve called it
Wow amazing playcall
Great play call.
3 for 3 on 4th down plays... eh... fuck you Fitchner anyway
"Wow Josh Allen converted a 3rd and 22 


Hes been getting rekt this 2nd half, but that was great"
Well done. Washington was scaring me there. Just drop after the first lol
Benny snells mouthpiece having a spinning rim on it is so on brand lmao
Why do we care about running the clock when they went 70 yards in 40 seconds like we NEED A SCORE
Lucky that wasn't a touchback lol.
That was was close to being a touchback
Ok...that was scary
"Geesh, that was closer"
I was scared af
If the Ravens and Chiefs beat these dudes by double digits then damn it so should we!
3 and 0
"Everyone call for Tomlin's head in the first half, how'd you like those 2nd half coaching adjustments?"
If the Steelers score 28 points we win. Lol 28 in 3 straight
"*Oh Mama, I'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law*"
UNDEFEATED
It was so nice having a good secondary for 1 year
How Edmunds doesn't get absolutely grilled every week in film is beyond me
Our secondary has seriously regressed
Btw that was terrible clock management (as always).
Nelson? Bad in coverage. Minkah? Nonexistent. Hilton? Neutral. BINCE? Why tf is he in coverage
"Yikes. All I heard all offseason was how amazing this defense was, but now they are getting lit up this week after getting lit up against a career shitty backup last week. 

I think this also shows that the ravens are legit...like really legit."
Browns and Bengals winning... FUCK TODAY
Conner you should have caught that.
#HIRE TODD HALEY
u/EmmettButcher I don't see a Houston TD right there... I see a sack and  your deleted comment.
I think I'm more mad about this game than the Jesse James TD call in terms of refball
"Texans will tire out.


Steelers bend bit don't break.


Going 3-0"
Lmao refball every week it's unbelievable
"We seem to always put linebackers on fast receivers, just Steelers things 😎"
Who knew our “fire everyone” game would come in week 3?
I know this thread is like this every week but a lot of you need to find a new team to watch. Every time the Steelers don't play perfectly it's the end of the world. FOH with that
It’s not an overreaction to question our secondary at this point
Remember when Steven Nelson was good last year?   I do. Dude gets touched up so often now.
Nelson has been getting burnt all year. What happened to him?
Running like he's trying to get to the front of the cafeteria line
That was obviously a first down it's actually rigged if it doesn't get overturned
Good play by bush not biting on that fake
Good shit Edmunds!!!
I thought our team was gonna give up 7 on every drive? That’s what the gamethread led me to believe
What a waste of a 2nd down
"i cant fucking stand fitchner, tired of these shit playcalls. couldnt design a good td drive if all of our lives depended on it"
It would be nice if Minkah would hit someone instead of just waiting with his arms out
Baker mayfield is so annoying
That's what I'm talking about! The reports of the Steelers demise were greatly exaggerated
Ahhh yes another day another game where I’m uncertain if my young 29 year old heart can take the Steeler suspense. HERE WE GO
TURN DOWN FOR WATT
Does anybody know if DeCastro is back?
I have Bears and Falcons instead of our game. Fuck fuck fuck
HERE WE GO! Who’s ready to be stressed for 3 hours?
We should start calling our defense women's pants because they don't have pockets.
WHAT AN EFFORT JUJU
nice effort  19!
juju a beast
JUJU THE FUCKING ACROBAT
"I’m a more cynical Steeler fan and give Juju shit but he’s a different player this year. Whether he’s just amped up or he just phoned it in last year, I don’t know. But if he keeps playing like he is, it’s going to be a hard decision for contracts."
There u go conner.
holy shit play action
Offensive like is giving conner some running room. Hoping him(and the ground game) do well today
Good catch vance
Still better than a bubble screen
We’ve showed em like 10 different things this drive
Shit play call. C'mon man
Not a bad opening drive. Obviously could have been better if they capped it off with a touchdown.
Michael Irvin is clearly high during the pregame
"Samuels didn't even get close. 

Well at least Bosgod will be fed."
Very obvious how much we were missing decastro with that drive
I love Chris Boswell
Benny Snell is in the doghouse. Tough scene for those saying Snell should be the starter after week one
I refuse to believe fichtner called that whole drive
"Points are points, but bad call on the run with samuels."
"I wont put too much stock in the first 8 mins or so of the game, both teams are still figuring each other out and adapting to the feel and flow. 

Let's get another 3 and out and a solid 2nd drive, and I'll feel better about the momentum.

We kinda need to punched in the mouth first before waking up"
What ever happened to the nfl streams sub?  Game isn’t on in my market
First time they mentioned all the watts playing
Every week I forget about Fichtner and every sunday I'm painfully reminded
Nelson what is you doin
Vince covering Cooks deep...
Well that was embarrassing
WHY IS BINCE ON COOKS
Fuck butler
Bleh. Hilton should have had that.
DeShaun coming out knowing he's got something to prove today
How can our secondary suck this much. As soon  as our blitz doesn’t work and the ball leaves qbs hand you know it’s a completion
"Typically slow defensive start. No matter how good our defense they usually look bad the first drive, last drive before the end of the half and late 3rd quarter."
Need Minkah to stop sleeping back there and get involved
now this is the usual first drive run run pass offense
4 man rush. 3 get the QB
Play calling from first drive to second drive is so different?????
run run pass will never work
"Why do we go run, run, pass when our running backs can’t run?!"
Ahhhh the ol’ run run pass punt. You hate to see it
60 straight game with a sack 😈
Hilton is a monster against Bubble screens
"Defense bounced right the fuck back. 

Now do the same thing offense. Do it. Do it."
3 weeks in a row where Johnson fucks up on a punt return?
"Let that ball go, Dionte!  What the hell."
Sounds bad but hopefully it’s his nuts and not his groin
Get DJ outta the GD PR spot
"He knew he fucked up as soon as he called for that fair catch, I don't think he knew where he was on the field"
Dj needs to develop some game awareness
diontae is a good player with some bad decisions
Did that look like a groin issue or a hit to the balls? Hoping nothing serious.
Hey... a Benny Snell sighting... at least he didn’t fumble.
Might as well punt on third down so we do one thing Houston isn't expecting (besides fair catch at the 4 yard line).
"Wow our offense is still rusty, you hate to see it in your own red zone YIKES"
That offensive series was fucking ridiculous!
Bince...Da man...
At least Bince Williams is playing his heart out
"Well hey, at least it wasn't run run pass lol. Run pass pass new era"
Are they even aware there’s a game today?
Man go back to Steeler fucking football on offense. I-formation with Watt leading Conner/Snell and use both TE’s in the pass game. Look at the strong offensive teams using 2 TEs they’re lethal and we have Ebron who can be a monster. This play calling is holding Ben back
When our defense produces more yards than our offense yet again...
🅱️ince playing like a man possessed.
Vince looks scary as fuck so far this season
"Fichtner: Let's run it.

Ben: *60 yard bomb to a receiver 40 yards downfield*"
I would've liked trying a slant 2 straight plays
"that 2nd down play looking like PI to me

after last week we are owed a few

Ben overthrowing everything by 20 yards tho"
This offense is our weak point. Cant beat good teams with a bad offense. Idc how good the defense is
"You know... I am starting to wonder if our secondary scheming is not all that good. Over the years, I have placed the blame on lack of talent...but now we have Haden, Fitzpatrick and Nelson...and Hilton as our nickel.

I know some people love to blame Edwards for everything on down to Climate Change...but something bigger than that just doesn’t seem right."
"Lots of game left to play. That first drive was great, I'm fully confident we can recreate that. Unfortunately we're losing the field advantage game, but I foresee a turnover coming in the next quarter. Secondary got burnt on the TD drive, but I'm not overly worried. As long as they communicate and adapt, we'll be fine."
I feel like we lost half our secondary
are we about to get embarrassed?
Watching Bill Belicheck eat a subway sandwich on a strip mall bench is jarring
WIDE OPEN. wtf are they doing.
Of course hes wide the fuck open
Pretty obvious hold on TJ there
Watson is gonna have 40 passes for 400 yards at this rate.
TJ is blatantly being held
Dude that tackle is holding TJ so slickly I hate it
So basically if they pass we’re fucked
"Lamar Jackson takes that for 50 yards

shit"
"Well this is getting ugly fast. 

We're in trouble boys."
Ok lets try this thing where we complete some passes and score a touchdown.
zone is getting torched. Need a td bad on the next drive
"MFW they had us ranked like the 7th best team, LOL!"
"So first quality QB we play against. And defense looks like utter crap. 
Offense looked bad all season thus far. 

It’s disappointing to see considering KC (34-20) and BAL (33-16) handled HOU easily."
"I guess they don't call holding anymore.

Better to start adjusting now than when they inexplicably stop calling holding in the playoffs like they do every year."
Incredible how badly this secondary has regressed
Lmao this holding
we actually suck don't we?
Why does our pass defense look so much worse than last year?
"Come on guys, us dolphins fans are rooting for y’all hard"
"Please god, let the Steelers get at least 1 TD"
"Good. Run run run. Our top two backs came in averaging somewhere around 5 yards per carry, and we have an explosive young guy to complement them. Let’s run, rush rush rush."
if we settle for a fg i will be so angry
James “down at first contact” Conner
God ebron looks like he's about to drop everything he does catch lmao
Look at Ben with the block.
SNEAK IT COWARDS
BEN OLINE MASTER
This play calling is so good when we're actually playing to win
We are perennially bad at short yardage runs
i swear if we don’t get 7 here...
Ben's feeling pretty good if he's out there throwing lead blocks
If there was ever a time to run run pass
Just run it with conner
EBROOOOON
"YESSSSSS

FUCK YOUR FLAG"
"There it is, fuck you refs."
EBRON!!!!!
THERE WE GO EBRON
"Not watching a stream today, but apparently what I’m watching is still behind. Rip. I guess CBS all access is still technically a stream?"
ok can we calm down now?
We REALLY needed that. Hell yeah!
That catch has some Santonio Holmes SB43 vibes
That was pretty hot ngl
Let the big dog eat!
E squared.
What a fucking pass and catch. That’s huge.
Did he try to kick Ebron?!
Ebron haters suck it.
get lamar off of my tv
Let’s get the fucking ball back for a quick score before the half
Secondary needs to bulk up now.
"Just when i think you couldn't get any dumber, you go and call a play like that.... AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF"
Needed some time to put offense together... now if the secondary isn’t exploitable...
Nice long drive! Gave our D a chance to catch there breath and do some game planning. TO incoming
I hate being on the west coast. I just want to watch my boys!
Way to punish the scramble
Literally every time we blitz 5+ it works.
A demon possessed me as I yelled the words “GET HIM!”
[deleted]
Yay defense! Keep doing it like that!!
Time for a Claypool big play.
We're going to get to see 2 minute ben !?
Did Johnson lose his PR job after that fair catch at the four
Conner is just not explosive man. Great story and I love the guy but I’m tired of watching him run.
what is this run run pass 2 min offense?
2 minute warning this is where Ben shines
We have got to stop doing the same fucking run run pass shit
Bring Willie Parker out of retirement I stg I can’t bear to watch us run it
Conner just trying to run into people with his back because of all those back workouts
DJ and D Watt injured..
This is the Ben effect right here baby.
Head Injury for Diontae
Ebron getting his hands dirty this week. I like it!
Enjoying this drive
occasionally screen pass  to conner has been working pretty well. Reminds me of Bell days a bit.
OH... THAT WAS FAST LMFAO
JUJU STYLING ON THESE FOOLS
How do you blow a coverage that bad?
BOOM SHACKA LACKA!  Nice fucking pocket protection... that was a big blitz
Ben to JuJu for the TD...music to my ears
But ThE GaME is OvERrr guys
"Best drive of the season, that was so satisfying to watch holy shit"
Chefs kiss
There's no way this is happening without Ben. God how we all missed him lol
VOODOO MAMA JUJU
"And just like that, we're back on top. And we get the ball back after the half. Oh ye of little faith!"
Great fucking drive. Damn I love JuJu man. I hope he stays with us.
That  is called wide ass open
Ok now secondary please stop their 2-minute drill before the half.
JUJU LETS FUCKING GOOO
Lets just run no huddle for the second half.
We were down by 11 for about two minutes.  During that time half this sub were about ready to become Ravens fans :/
FIRE GMJR
JUJUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!!!
Defense needs to force a stop here this is huge now
The offense needs to keep this up. I hate when they get a lead and start to play conservative. PEDAL TO THE METAL AND CRUSH THEM LET'S GOOOOOO!
"So your kids are misbehaving and the solution is buy a bigger house?

What kind of fucked up message you sending Rocket Mortgage?"
Holy wide open... Even juju was surprised by the looks of it
Gotta worry we handed them the ball back with too much time left on the clock.
"Wish we ate up more clock on that last drive, knew Houston would drive up the field here"
"NFL Sunday football, now with 100% more commercials!"
Yeah just play soft zone..
17-17 is worst case scenario. 21-17 cannot be an option
"*Watson carves up zone d left and right*

Butler: let's keep running zone"
HELLO? DEFENSE?!?
Predictable
You have GOT to be kidding me.
I thought this was supposed to be the best defense lol
Are you fucking kidding me
walking all over our secondary
bring a blitzer please
Yoooo that made me sad
Our secondary literally has no discipline
Wow..... Looks like it's gonna be a shootout.
Nelson didn't even fucking try
What happened to our secondary? Ugh :(
This 2018 all over again
Secondary is imposter
Nelson having a tough start to the year
50 second drive... Pathetic!
Wow we are getting torched.  :(
Nelson is shit
This defense is boggling sometimes.
Unbelievable. Defense looked like they were ready for half time
You would score 100 points against us if you ran a quick pass every play
Haven’t heard shit from heyward or Tuitt once this game. Not good enough to beat Watson
Gotta run a play there... see if getting into FG range is possible. They had two TOs. That’s frustrating.
I’m reading on Twitter TJ watt went into the locker room holding his arm and may be hurt. Anyone see info on this?
This Secondary has to answer our questions. What has happened to them?
Need some Turnovers baby
I’m more worried about Nelson over minkah
I know defenses are at a disadvantage because of the no contact rules and having ahard time practicing but this can't be considered acceptable to this team.
"Butler probably made zero adjustments during the break. ""Keep playing hard, zone will work eventually!"""
"I have to get the ""damn I hate #26"" out of my head after barron last year, McFarland looks nice"
We also aren’t gonna kick a field goal at mid field...so that’s different
"Ben deep ball pls, that’s the third or fourth tough miss today"
That's a fucking first down
Bens going to give me a heart attack
"Hey guys, I know the first and second long ball didn't work.... but what about third long ball? Surely that'll work"
NICE RUN BEN
Fast Ben Roethlisburger
"&#x200B;

*First Down!!!*"
Good challange
Ben with the stiffy
He made that shit come on
"It's not often you win a spot challenge, but they should get this one. He's over the marker."
How do you fuck up that spot by a whole damn yard when you're right there
"Benjamin ""Hot Rod"" Todd Roethlisberger"
"Ben got it, whether or not the refs recognize is a coin flip IMO"
FUCKING REFS.
WTF
BULLSHIT
EVEN GENE SAID IT WAS A FIRST
Horrible call
KO your local ref
"So frustrated with the producers. They keep cutting away from the end of the play before they show us where the officials are spotting the ball. Hold your water for a couple of seconds to show us what is going on. 

They went to commercial for the challenge without even showing us where the ball was spotted."
That is THE most obvious wrong call I’ve ever seen
What an awful awful call
What the fuck
How?????
Fuck you ref
The ref who reviewed that play should be fired immediately. That was fucking ridiculous.
Claypool can ACT! lol
"Absolute hose job from these refs. Houston holds on every fucking play, offense and defense."
I hate that play call
bullshit ref call on the ben stretch.
KARMA
complete bullshit on the mark so idc
Lmao that was a horrible call. These refs are trash
We got bailed out hard
BALL DONT FUCKING LIE ASSHOLES
"I normally don’t complain about the refs..but that call was bull. And to the guy that got Sharkey’s, my condolences...get some Dino’s, son..!!"
The referees are fixing the mistake on the challenge
Well these receivers are not helping Ben
Oh come on... FUCKING CATCH THAT BALL
Al wtf dumb
ben kinda.. inaccurate today?
Is diontae hurt?
Let's put something together boys. We need it.
Drop drop drop
can somebody please catch
CATCH THE BALL
The fuck was that play call
God AV is terrible
Long. Painful.  Failed drive.
What a fucking awful drive
Catch the fucking ball
Thankfully Box is not Box from 2018. Something to be happy about
A clock has better hands
Super happy about Steelers special teams
guys quit saying ben should throw it less hard lol. its the nfl. these guys should catch these passes
Anyone else see McCloud just eat a hit that would have taken most players out of the game?
God damn McCloud took a fucking hit and took off like a Fox in a Arwing!
Not used to special teams clicking. Especially kickoff coverage.
I think McCloud may become the featured punt returner
ok let the texans do that thing where they blow the game.
Ray Ray is pretty good at this kick/punt return thing.
Well fuck... just got embarassed on that blocking assignment
Running the ball on 2nd and 19. You hate to see it
A draw on 2nd and 19.... on your own 20. Great call. What a pioneer
Why do you run on 2nd and 19
Who thought.the run was the right call?
Running on 2nd and 19 is chicken shit
"Starting to think they may be better off with Feiler at RT and Dotson at LG. No disrespect to Chuks, more about Feiler struggling at G."
Need to protect your first ballot hall of Famer better
I swear our offense is best when it's no huddle
Ben being injured would be soo Steelers lol
"We rely way too much on defense. 

Let's get another stop boys."
Where is Dupree today?
We finally start with great field position. Let's take advantage.
“outstanding field position”. Alright now let’s do something with it!
"gotta be kidding me, we needed a td"
Wtf!! I didn’t know you can grab arms now!
We gotta get juju involved
I guess you can just pin the receivers arms now.
Missed PI
Holy PI Batman
I would like an interception or a fumble please and thank you
Fuck these refs
Splish splash our offense is playing like trash
Run the ball
Are we capable of guarding the middle of the field?
This defense is getting abused
Secondary is asshole.
I feel like I've seen the same thing happen 12 times this game holy shit
3rd and long.. guess they'll pick this one up as well... 🤷🏼‍♂️
Fuck this defense today
glad the secondary is enjoying their front row seats to the game!
LFG!!!! Hilton been having a great game today.
MONEY MIKE
YESSSS!!
MIKE HILTON
FUCK YEAH
There's a spark. Now go get it offense.
YES FINALLY
Yes! Hilton
Looks like he pulled his hammy when he jumped
Praise Mike Hilton lol
Fuck thought Watson was out for a moment there.
"Lucky that wasn't a late hit on TJ, but nice job Hilton. Let's go get it now."
"Watt very lucky to not get a flag there, phew"
Let's put some points on the board offense. Preferably 8.
"[Mike Hilton, next March.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/8b/97/018b9783b964a36bb05fe05605d3c702.gif)"
If we go three and out I’ll be fucking livid
"Please offense, play like our last drive in the 1half"
Butler has been our DC for 6 years?  Holy shit time flies.
Ebron lookin' good!
"I’m not sure what happened there, but I liked it"
"I don't ever want to hear Phil Simms say ""Chubby"" like that again"
Our inability to get short yardage is obnoxious.
We are allergic to gaining short yardage
There's some Benny Snell Football
His arm is too damn strong
"Why have one feature back when you could have Conner, Snell, Samuels, and McFarland?"
"Just run for it Ben, you're practically the fastest man on the field!!"
The Vance Truck rumbles
LETS GOOOO
Vance is fucking awesome
CONNER BABY LETS FUCKING GO FOR 2
JAMES CONNER MUTHAFUCKA (real nice block by fieler)
Huuuge drive
Nice run for 6
OH BABYYYYY
Trubisky and foles is arguably worse than Rudolph and hodges.
Feiler redemption! Conner looks good today
Fuck yeah
Let’s goooo 28-21
"I feel like Rick Flair right now!

WOOOOOOOOO!"
Worried that the 2pt gets challenged
I wouldn't hate a pick 6 right here.
that’s what happens when TJ WATT isn’t held
WATTTTT!
"Its THIRRRRRRD DAAAHHHN


... and 26"
TJ Watt is going to be worth the entire Steelers organizational worth lolol
OH MAMA IM IN FEAR FOR MY LIFE FROM THE LOOOONG ARM OF THE LAW
"The defense has been looking leagues better in this 2nd half, I can't tell rn if it's due to adjustments or what but they look good"
Lots of game left and have to work the clock out and at least get 3. Watson scored 3 TDs in under 3 minutes in the first half
Please put it away here. Don’t be conservative
STAY IN BOUNDS!
Back to back 100 yard rushing games. Seems pretty good to me.
I need 16 yards from JC here
Defense really stepped up in the 2nd half. Gotta close this one out.
VANCE MCDONALD JUST KILLED THAT MAN
Field goal ends it
go for it fk em
How many fucking times are they going to waste a perfect opportunity for a playaction pass?
Bubble screen time
JW LETS GOOOOO
Fuck It. Go for it.
GO FOR IT. DONT BE A BITCH.
I love that play call right there.
No one is saying just kick it jackass.
I love the ambition
buuuuurrrrrn that clock baby
I’m sorry everybody. Just put on my 7 jersey at the start of the 4th. Should’ve wore it the whole game.
Holy shit that’s scary
Danny Smith and a whole pack of gum in his mouth as usual lol.
Luckily ball didn't go through the end zone
11 is my next jersey.  I love this kid.
Chase Claypool 🐐🐐🐐
Sure he's not fumbling but he's also got like 8 yards on as many carries.
Could've easily been a touchback lol but we don't live in our fears
Very lucky that didn't go out through the end zone
That was lucky.
3-0 BOISSS
Better give it Conner...
Fat lady is warming up in the tunnel
😀about to go up 3-0
Victory formation
I was depressed half the game but not anymore
"Don’t forget guys, the game was O-V-E-R after 1.5 quarters of football"
Kick the FG just to score over 30.
Can someone explain to me why the clock started to run before the two minute warning without us snapping the ball?
"After the defense allowed that score to end the half, they pitched a shutout in the 2nd. You love to see it"
Shutout in the 2nd half!
"What a performance by the defense in the 2nd half!

Feel real good about this team atm"
Name a more iconic duo than the Steelers starting slow in the first quarter and sometimes the entire first half.
what is like 83% chance to make the playoffs if you go 3-0
3 and fucking 0 baby
LMFAOOO WE'RE GONNA GET BLOWN OUT BY THE 0-2 TEXANS BOYS!
i see this place hasn’t forgotten how to overreact
I can’t fucking stand Villanueva man. Talk about somebody who doesn’t at all deserve the mark of 2x Pro Bowler. Thanks for your service but you’re not good
Secondary continues to be garbage
Vince on cooks? Why?
"Williams on Brandin cook. Nice. 

We need a coverage linebacker asap"
Defense what the fuck was that
"Sounds like giving advice to my first girlfriend I got frisky with. Don't do anything cute, just touch my balls the conventional way and focus on the basics."
Touch down bong hit!!
LOL at all you fucking nerds saying the game was over in the first quarter
"At least TRY, Nelson! You know.... jump or do something defensive!"
It’s hard to say you couldn’t see this coming. Jones and Driskel threw for 530 yards on us and they picked us apart. Now Watson has 200 yards in a half. The secondary regressed so much.
"So if we lose TJ, this game just got a lot tougher"
How many people want to bet we trot out the same defensive scheme at the half even though it's clear to a blind man that it ain't working
I don't think Minkah has made a play so far this season. He's due for a game changing play
"Good


Stop


D"
Good job breaking down so there was nowhere to go with the ball after the catch. Wait for help to rally and make the sure stop.
Conner runs like he thinks he's Leveon.
I fucking can’t stand this play-calling. Losing the fucking game and playing like cowards.
"We're playing against the desperate texans, the sportsbooks and the refs today. This was always going to suck, but fucking hell."
Oh shit... their OC remembered he can pass on us
Don’t worry Fichtner can mess up this momentum switch too
I cannot with these play calls. Stop with the fucking horizontal shit
IF we end up going 3-0 after this game...can people lay off the armchair General managing just a little?
Go for the touchdown PLEASE
Gonna check post histories to see how many of you said it was over
Man you guys are insufferable lmao
Ben is THE man though. Some of you dipshits need to recognize that.
You can tell Randy sits when pees because he runs it on 2nd and 19.
"Think I would've went for that, maybe that's why I'm not the coach"
Why hand off to our passing back when we need 3 yards?
I think the Texans just want this one more today.
I’m scared we gave Houston too much time
"Are you fucking kidding me?

Show the fuck up secondary."
Did they really just shit on us in 50 seconds?
Nelson is becoming a liability.
Well I have no way to watch the game but it sounds like this once great defense has fallen apart. If you ask me it's totally a coaching issue. How you go from amazing to bad this fast without it being on the coaches is beyond me. They've let the players get lazy and slow.
"I came in here looking to vent about the secondary a little bit, but jeez the bridge jumping going on in here is insane"
Catch the fucking ball
3 n out baby let’s go
It’s Either a 3 and out or TD drive for the D
"RAY RAY, A FUCKING STATUE"
Why run it up the middle on 2nd and 19?!
That punt sucked ass!
I need about 4 packs of cigarettes and 2 30 racks after this game
"We need 7 here with a conversion, no FG boys"
Look I just want the win but for fantasy purposes I’d love to see another Conner-6 here. Rolled him and Juju today
Honestly the defense looks like it’s regressed a bit from last year. Hopefully they pull it together as the season progresses.
"Losing to Bill O’Brien

lol"
Id rather have casper the friendly ghost out there than Minkah. What the hell happened to him?
"One thing to all Americans here. I get it you guys WANT YOUR GUNS. All Good. You guys DONT WANT FREE HEALTHCARE. ALL GOOD. 

BUT HOW THE FUCK DO YOU GUYS ACCEPT THIS MUCH COMMERCIALS DURING THE GAME."
Here we fucking go!
"Anybody else plays the game audio on two sets of speakers to get that ""bar"" vibe in the home?"
May the best Watts win!!!
Ahh yes. Here we are. Another week of overreactions and crazy takes. I’m ready baby.
"LETS GO BABY!!!

WHO RIDE!?!?"
"Shoutout to my fellow East Coast noontime drunks, and even bigger shout-out to my West Coast brethren pounding those Bloody Marys. Let's get this W boys."
"Who’s ready for some Steeler Football?
Its time for egregious overreactions, terrible playcalling and even worse penalties on todays viewing of the National Football League"
"""expecting high wattage"" I quit I'm going back to bed."
"Drink every time you hear ""Watt"" or ""Brother"""
Did Houston just forget about TJ on that first play?
Iron Mike....we love you
Holy shit Juju! Lets go!
Holy fucking shit juju
Holy shit what a play juju
We have to keep juju holy fuck
Did Juju just backflip for a first?
Juju been playing like a te this season
we didn't go run run pass in that first drive
"Holy shit, you love to see that effort from Juju, especially with a bum wheel"
Mcfarland sighting!
Looking good so far. Eating the clock up
WHO TF IS CALLING THESE PLAYS?! AINT no way this is Randy 😭😭
Why run with Samuels in there
BOSGOD
Is JJ playing?
So tired of seeing Samuels in the backfield
"Honestly it’s okay with the fg, liked the look the offense has"
We are really stupid when it comes to personnel.
Finally got a stream going
"I love how half the people are shitting on the play calling and the other half are impressed that Randy called that drive. It was a bad third down call but come on guys, that was improvement!"
I'd watch Attenborough narrate a documentary about paint drying.
What has Danny Smith been doing bruh out ST is good this year
Nelson was like 4 yards behind him. Yikes
"Can someone pm me a way to watch the game? /r/NFL streams is gone. Please help. I'm not in the coverage area.

Edit: thanks everyone!"
Steven Nelson is worrying me. Hopefully last year wasn’t a fluke.
Vince Williams on brandon cooks?!?!
Need to pressure. Send an extra rusher.
"Vince Williams covering a WR. Brilliant, Keith Butler."
Cover the middle of the fucking field
Man coverage is not working
Williams is gonna get torched
"Bill o Brian is stupid enough to just run ball, so I have hope"
And this is why you don’t settle for field goals
"Keith Butler is such a dog shit NFL coach. Houston had two TD plays exposing Williams and Hilton in coverage, the only two guys who get attacked through the air. Get them off the field in passing downs"
"I.

Hate.


Cover.


One.


Please stop.


Thank you."
"Damn, we did everything that drive except stop Watson from carving us up like swiss cheese."
"Secondary has left a lot to be desired, especially compared to last year. Nelson doesn't look like the same player, haven't heard Minkah's name called much, I think maybe last year was just some guys having the best year of their careers. Too bad they can't keep playing like that."
I don't have a good feeling about this game rn
Run run pass. Defense is predictable and offense is even more so.
We can’t rush on the worst run D in the league
Lol ugh. 2 obvious runs and pass. Such a bold strategy
Run run pass punt jump off a bridge into the Allegheny River
Run run pass strikes again
Hate all these running plays when our rb is James Conner
Well shit... Offense needs to wake the fuck up.
[deleted]
Would love to see Randy open up the playbook a little.
"Claypool took on two blockers the whole way down the field and still got deep enough to force that return back inside.

Guy impresses me every time he steps on the field."
BINCE
Hate all these running plays when our rb is James Conner
"Randy, the playbook isn’t a fucking Denny’s menu, you can’t just order the same shit every day for fucks sake try something else for once you bastard"
"Roethlisberger’s brain must be pure mush at this point. Like, it’s kind of amazing that he can even walk and chew gum at the same time much less ply football."
"Now that’s our Steelers defense, LETS GO"
There you go Hilton! You gotta spend all day making up for the td but that’s a great start.
There we go D.
Don't fucking fair catch that
If weren't not getting to the QB then they're hitting guys wide open 10-20 yards downfield. Also why the fuck would you fair catch inside the 5.
WHY FAIR CATCH AT THE 4 YARD LINE?! LET IT FUCKING BOUNCE
Why the hell would you fair catch that!
Danny Smith football baby! It’s never Mike Tomlin’s fault for employing incompetent coordinators!
plant your heels at the ten dont go backwards bud
WHY WOULD YOU FAIR CATCH THAT
"Wow, just let that punt go instead of fair catching"
Brain fart should’ve let it bounce
Godamnit diontae
"You know what, this is some damn good tackling this year. It really is showing."
"""The question is: WHY?"""
McCloud has been looking great back there anyway
Diontae is not long for punt return duty.
Why would you fair catch on the 4 dionte
Let it go Diontae what the fuck
Wtf why didn't he let it bounce into the endzone?!
"Alright, I've never played this sport and I think even I would have been smart enough to let that bounce"
"I can probably explain that but it’s still super shitty.

He assumed with that booming, low flying punt that the punter outkicked the coverage. At the last second he looked down and saw that our outside contain was literally non existent and both gunners were right in front of him so he instinctively fair caught it.

It sucks, it makes sense, experience will be make that better. I’m guessing Danny Smith gives him the greenlight inside the 10 if he likes what he sees. Maybe he shouldn’t."
Ben just calling a timeout so he can call his own plays
At least Ben can still throw deep?
Jesus. Go back to the dump off passes
What are these play calls
Lmao wtf was that
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING
More Claypool please
Ah classic goal line bomb
Why take double coberage when the checkdown has enough room to run??
"A 10 yard first down is just as good, Ben."
Holy shit ebron was wide open underneath
Ben we get it. You still have a cannon. Now settle down and play winning football
I’m hoping this is just a slow start
VINCENT
BINCE BABY!!!!
Holy shit vince
What shitty field position yikes
Ouch! Down population you Johnson!
Turnover this drive. Calling it
BINCE AND HILTON SHOW BOYS
Big Vince baby!
"Bince Billiams, thank you"
My Cousin Vinny again with the sequel tackle for a loss.
Ben is trying to hit Covid with the long ball
Our secondary is ass
We didn’t even blitz and he was wide open.
Secondary needs to tighten the fuck up.
Soft as baby shit zone secondary.
Our secondary has been spotty this year.  Need to tighten it up.
"Keep running, Houston.  It's the only we we can stop the ball right now"
Why would you even try to run against us lmao
"Watt getting held, again"
Just remember - last week the defense was on fire all of the first half and then came out flat. There's still plenty of time in this game. Be patient. The second half could be the complete opposite
How bad is this secondary? It’s reminding me of 2018 season
Uhh holding?
Will there ever be a holding call for tj?
"Holy fuck, are they not calling holding at all?"
"So far, a typical slow Steeler start.  Hang in there fans, plenty of game left to go."
If you’re the Texans why even stop passing?
That’s a killer to give up the first down there.
Great job Bush!!!! Perfect way to read the TEs eyes and play the ball.
Holy shit that was so sad our guys ran into each other lmao
Somebody name one bright spot from this game so far. Please
This is disgusting
Our Pass coverage is just bad this year. I thought we fixed the problem from several years ago.
What a shit show lmao
I wish sometimes we had a mobile QB. Or even a secondary. Why does Texas even try to run?
I'm not certain I understand what I've seen so far. Any film guys able to break it down for me? Seems to me like we have decided we are not interested in winning this one.
I know it’s early but we look really bad
"We’re losing right now, but I’d much rather this team play than whatever that abomination was last season. That was such a dark time."
Our coordinators are an absolute joke
Playing bad in every conceivable way
STOP PLAYING ZONE
WE NEED TO RUN RUN RUN THIS NEXT DRIVE AND GO THREE AND OUT
Hard to win when you’re fighting two teams. Can TJ get a single holding call
So is our defense not as good as everyone advertised?
"Backups in on the right side, Wormley and Highsmith and they just run at them

good time to have them in"
sigh.
"So many people who don't know shit about football saying Minkah is bad. It's not Minkah, it's the fucking scheme."
"Defensive backs need to step up, theyre getting torched. Maybe we need to get out of zone? Watson's just picking us apart."
Yep already like this kid
I see you McFarland!
Wow he is F A S T
I liked that McFarland. Keep doing that.
Oh shit y’all have McFarland he was an animal in college
Daddy McDonald 🌭🌭🍆
I could really go for a Vance MacDonald shadow-realm stiff arm today
Shit I think even Buffalo would smoke us at this point
"I love Ebron, dudes a huge Target."
Ben blocking.....
I wish we had another hefty back for plays like that. Can I have fast big and can catch. Can I just have it all???
Ben getting in there with the cut block lol love it
You see this?? We don’t need the big passes. Keep it short and simple and we drive easily
Johnson knocked the wind out of himself with that hit.
Thought Snell had it... jeez
Need a score here
Ben out here throwing blocks 👌🏾
Looked like McDonald was supposed to release.
🤦‍♂️
YESSIR
EBRON
Why didn’t Vance run open? It’s like he was just standing there
That was a GUTSY call!!
"Wow, sick catch"
Rollercoaster of emotion drive there
Clutch.
Ebron is balling out today! LETS GO!
"Yep, that was grounding"
Ebron bout to go off let’s gooooo
Back in it bois
Whoever said Ebron looks like he's made out of clay obviously doesn't know chiseled marble.
phew. alright come on defense
"Defense give me an int now, I want the lead"
Nice to finally have a TE that produces again 👀 McDonald went totally quiet not too long after that iconic stiff arm.
Nice catch
Quick three and out
Let’s go D
Lol he tried to kick him or something?
Ball don’t lie
"Don’t fuck it up D! We need you to hold them to 3 & out.

Or a pick 6. I’d definitely take a pick 6."
Ebron is one physical loon. Red Zone maniac knows how to make the space
What was that kick off?! Saved by Allen
More Steelers in the back field than down field
DJ hurt?
Big D stop
that was a delay of game to me but I'll take it
3 & out! Here we go!
With how often Ray Ray has fumbled PRs I’m not any more confident with him back there
Is NFL Sunday ticket worth it? I live in Philly and finding a stream that doesn't have a lot of cancerous ads that works on my fire stick is absolutely rage inducing
God damn I wish we had a punter like that.
"If we had a good punter, our special teams would be insane."
"When your defensive line is as good as ours is, there will just be less holding calls. It's be 3rd and 30 for houston every time"
Noooo Derrick :(
Derek noooooo!!!!
Why the fuck are we running the clock out?
B b b but...run run pass... why aren't we punting waaaahh
17-14 COME ON... ILL DO ANYTHING!
Conner as our 7th string reciever?????
GOOD JUJU
HELL FUCKIN YEAH JUJU
THAT IS HOW WE PLAY
JU MF JU!!!!
Fuck yeah that's what we like to see lol I thought he was about to step out of bounds there
JUJUUUUUUUUUUU
"just think, yall were super tripping ten mins ago"
We went 7 plays for 63 yards in a minute without using a single timeout or a pass traveling more than 8 yards.
Haha juju wide open... he walked to the end zone
Where are the naysayers??
Lol doesn't get easier than that
Let’s get a big defensive play now
I can't believe I have to miss this game
BD strip sack inbound
"Okay if we stop them, we need to use our timeouts and try to get the ball back. Lets go defense"
“Juju’s on that beat..... in the endzone”
Wide open.... again
I can’t believe we are back to having a soft defense. Last years defense was so fun to watch. Why can’t we have both a good offense and defense at the same time?
Our defense needs to fucking nut up here!
"He’s targeting Hilton every time. Great in the flat, terrible in the secondary"
PICK INCOMING
Tuitt seems off this year...I wonder if the injuries are starting to take their toll
..LMFAO... i don't even know what to say
Garbage
Jesus...fucking....Christ...
Nelson is trash
LMAO sick
"Hello defence, are you there?"
What the fuck was that
"TJ not on the field that last play...oh man, pls let him be ok."
"Ate our fucking lunch of that drive, damn."
Nelson pushed him up to get the ball lmao
Nelson has been getting destroyed this game
Vietnam flashbacks with the secondary this year
Watson on pace for 400 yards passing
21 first half points given up (and no given turnovers)?
"""let's watch steelers tape to build confidence""

that's how shit our zone d is."
Situational awareness is something the Steelers will never be good at. Working the sidelines on their last drive was completely unnecessary and led to 7 Houston points. When your defense is sucking you have to at least try to help them.
I feel like y’all forget how stressful these Steelers games can be.
"Watson is just really good at escaping the pressure, making our pass rusher less effective, which is the key part to secondary performance. This makes me worried about the Ravens game..."
Prevent defense prevents the Steelers from winning the game.
Oh man mccloud is fun to watch. More so than switzer was anyway
"Tomlin and his aviators, such an iconic duo."
I love that they're actually using MacFarland this game
Would have been messy not to get that
Connor needs to be the short yardage back everytime imo. Samuel's and McFarland both have failed to convert on 3rd and 1 today
That's my QB
Steelers Injury Update: WR Diontae Johnson (possible concussion) & FB Derek Watt (hamstring) have been downgraded to OUT for today's game
WHAT A STUD
Yes Ben!
Did anyone elses heart stop when saw that white jersey coming to meet him at the first down marker?
That's a first down!
Don't pull a hammy there Ben
Easy challenge
Can't see his knee when it goes down. Is that good or bad for us??
"Don’t know about that, knee looked down but hard to tell where the ball was when he went down"
Mobile QB? Started with Ben to the right
Wow that’s horrible
Refs have been fucking us all season
HOW THE MOTHER FUCK DOES THAT STAND?! END YOURSELF
"What the fuck, he got that with the extension"
Why the fuck do we have to play every game against 2 teams
That's pure bias
That is one of the worst calls I have ever seen in a review
"Steelers vs Refs

Edit: nvm"
The ol’ Joe Flacco strat
Lol always terrible calls against us
Is there some kind of conspiracy against Tomlin on reviews?
Holy shit deep on a 4 and 1 bailed out refs knew they fucked up
"So are the rules just... if its not a first down, fuck you and your challenge?"
Make up call
Shut the fuck up that's not on Claypool
WHAT KIND OF PASS IS THAT
we finally got a bullshit call holy fuck
My god do these refs fucking suck. Like cool it benefits us but make a right call every once in a while would you?
Are they just throwing flags to adjust for their shit calls?
"Ok, a bad call makes up for a bad call?"
Well I'll take a DPI to bail us out of that and set us up with good field position. Hopefully we get in the endzone this time.
Make up call
Two terrible calls by the refs
4th and 1 easy pass to an open Ebron? No fucking sling it 30 yards!
These refs are fucking assssssss
"Terrible call LOL, I'll take it!"
There we go. The equalizer penalty. Fuckers.
I think I would have declined that.
THE DROPS OMG THEY WANT TO LOSE
Dammit JW
Catch the goddamn ball!
James didn’t even close his fingers to catch that lol that was so weird
Gotta catch that conner
catchhhh theeee fuckingggg ballllll
This offense can’t get out of its own way. For fucks sake
At least a nice long drive like that wears down the defense
Deshaun Watson gonna throw a pick here after running around for 5 minutes
Why are our receivers and backs not named Juju dunking their hands in grease before games?
Edmundsssss
I want a Watt thread too :D
Great work D
Edmunds does never let anyone juke him
RAY RAY
I love ray ray
Ray-Ray can Run-Run.
"Wow. Excluding DJ's return TD last year, Ray Ray looks like our best punt returner in a while."
"Edmunds! All you Negative Nancy's, that kind of bend-dont-break, open field tackling is exactly why we drafted him."
RAY RAY
mccloud looking like dri archer should have been
I don't understand Houston trying the run this often when they've had so much more success through the air. I'll take it though.
"Really love how McCloud runs it. 

Hope we can settle on him being our returner so we can stop with the Switzer nonsense"
That guy plays football
I need someone to upload that ray ray punt return later
"You know... I think McCloud is going to be a significant transaction. He seems to be one of those guys who could take it to the house any time. 

And it has more to do with what I have seen thus far than this last good punt return. There’s a certain skill that kick/punt returners have...and that is that they improve on the fly. They don’t think... they catch and GO."
Sick blocking
You’re fucking kidding me why on God’s green earth would you call a draw play there?!
"2nd &19 run? OK, that was dumb."
With McCloud on the team we need to capitalize on the potential for Star Fox memes.
Wasted drive
Horrendous play call
yep running on 2nd and 19 will work eventually /s
How about some hurry up offense
Colquitt fuckin stinks
Can we get a sack
"Need more out of Watt, and need less holding out of their right tackle."
SACK
GET TUITT
YES
Do it Tuitt!!!
That was a great sack.
Dupree has been EXTRA quiet today
I’ll say it for the tenth time: why would you run the ball against us
"Do it, Tuit!"
Do it Tuitt!!
Good job D!! Can we pleeaaaase win this game it’s right in our grasp
BACK TO BACK THREE AND OUTS
This is great field position. We have to get a TD here
"If we do not get any points on this series, then there has to be a curse on this team like we aren’t allowed to have good offense and good defense at the same time."
How many sacks is that now in this game?
I feel like that spot was still like 5 yards back
"Let's start a twitter campaign: REEVALUATE RANDY

And just flood Tomlin's account."
Great follow up drive for the D. Excellent 3rd quarter after a dismal 1st half. Hopefully they can keep it up for one more quarter.
They too scared to punt to Ray Ray
Joe Burrow. AKA the Cincinnati Punching Bag
"Damn good throw, good attempt"
Fucking all over him what the fuck!!!
Got to love being gifted great field position and then pissing it away
Definitely holding lol
Okay offense let's wake up on the next drive shall we?
"Nice stop, rook"
Need a turnover here
Fuck that was our chance
Middle of the field is always fucking open with these guys
Was he not very close to the LOS?
Heyward has been a tip machine.
Jesus guys
Third downs suck
Third and long is our kryptonite.
what the fuck is with this secondary
Cooks was already in the fetal position before Watt hit him
of fucking course its edmunds.
There ya go TJ!
Edmunds runs past \*TWO\* Texans receivers to try to spy Watson when he still would have needed about 12 yards for the first.
YES HILTON
Hilton is such a stud
HILTON
THANK YOU HILTON
Finally!!! The defense did something
HILTON
LETS FUCKING GO
HILTON
There it is!!
Let‘s go! That was important now stop calling bullshit Randy
Now let’s throw the ball.
Same guy everyone was trashing earlier.
I take back my comment about our secondary being ass..man I missed that feeling of a pick
Now can we fucking capitalize
My fav part of that pick is they just talked about watsons ability to extend plays and then he extends the play into a pick. Lol
Did I just completely black out? When did first down happen
There TEs are getting a lot of looks
"Alright, Ebron. More of that, my man."
Fucking love DeCastro pulling
I’m ready for a claypool play
Conner looks in pain ugh lol not again
Some defensive hands to the face EASILY called there on our lead blocker... but no flag
**I'll fucking do it again meme
Defense doing everything they can to give the offense opportunities. We need to capitalize on these.
We’ve never had a bubble screen work
"The one time it makes sense to run, run, pass and they don’t"
Aside from the 1 run when Connor lost his shoe... is Samuels basically been removed from the gameplan?  I can't even recall him last week
Ben missing deep a lot today
Ebron giving me flashes of good ol' HEEEEATH
I’m getting stressed 😥
I get so fired up whenever Vance runs people over
Vance!
our TEs putting in work!
Ben needs some reps to get used to his newly rebuilt arm on the long balls
Atleast Vance has shown up to play today
Big Vance
GIVE ME A FAT TD DADDY BEN 🤤
Vance have a dip in?
Conner has been good today in my opinion
We need a td. I know our defense has pulled it together but I still don’t trust them to keep the Texans out of at least fg range.
Go for 2!
WOOOOOO
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO
beautiful! atta boy JC!
Boy Connor looks REALLY fresh and rested right now.  Workhorse back showing his talent in these type of situations.  AND A FUCKING TOUCHDOWN
This is gonna need to be a TD imo watsons too good to shut him down the entire half
Fuck Yeah!  That was a great drive.
Offensive line is getting fucking gassed on these long ass drives.
Wow we converted!!
LFG!!!
JuuJuuu!
LFG
I LOVE THE STEELERS GOD DAMNIT!!!!!
Sharp drive there! Wave the Terrible Towel!!
That ref wanted to call it incomplete
Alright we just need to hold them now and it’s in the bag
Juju is just a tank
Looks like Houston's defense is getting tired
That’s what happens when he’s not being held
Why must my butt cheeks always be clenched when I watch my Steelers?
Tj is dominating watt bowl
"""WATCH ME FROM THE SIDELINES BIG BRO!  IMMA HURT YOUR QB""  - T.J. Watt"
Our Watt is BEST Watt
Feasting.
Web have just over 32 minutes of possession
Big time TJ fuck yeah that's five sacks so far for the team
Sign TJ Watt and sign him NOW
I’m making a subreddit dedicated to announcers that instantly look idiotic
Houston has collapsed over the last 10 minutes
DO NOT LET THEM PICK THIS UP.. got em on their heels
3rd down and half the distance to the parking lot... dont give them a penalty for the 1st please.
Ray ray take it to the house and end this
FINISH THEM!!
Our running backs were basically the three musketeer today
Come on boys: a long drive ending in points.  My heart will thank you.
Can we get a big play for Minkah as an extra cherry on top of this game? He needs one.
James Connor for 40 yards rushing this drive please
Watt you beautiful motherfucker
Why did he run out of bounds there?
I’m fine with running if it looks like that
that man went FLYING
"It seems like every time the color guy says something nice about houston, they give up a big play lol."
Not this conservative bs
END IT
^^go^^for^^it
First Dahn!
I love this team!!!!
THATS A GREAT CALL LETS GO
*Herm Edwards voice* “Hello?? You PLAY to WIN the game!” Be aggressive!
Totally thought they were going for the offside. Houston thought so too lol.
I LOVE THE YUGEEEEE BALLS ON TOMLIN
You love to see it
He'll save the children but not the Texan children.
LOL WTF
"Aw hell yeah, reporting eligible in here."
"Run it again, Boz boots it, go to 3-0"
Boswell looks like a weirdo. Just wanted to get that out there.
"""Better to have died a small child than fumble the football.""

The man ain't wrong."
BIG CLAY
Bro mapletron
“Fumble out the back of the end zone...touchback”
"Damn, that ref psyched me out there, thought he was bringing his arms up."
We almost went a full game without a fumble
Heart attack averted for another week
BIG PLAYPOOL
Fuck Grimble.
Chase Claypool is a fucking monster!!!
Claypool da gawd
BALL GAME
Man I love watching mister Claypool
3 knees baby. Nothing better.
Lot of people would like some more fantasy points here but I’m pretty sure this is gonna be 3 kneel downs
These sonic commercials are not as funny as they used to be
Hell yes boys!!!
"Defense came out of the half HARD, I love to see it"
I’m proud of how he came back the second half. Complete shut out
FUCK YA
Look you whiny yinzers the sky is still up there
you guys are gonna talk all this shit now but then turn right around when the steelers do good

This playing desperate has to stop. Everyone needs to calm down a little bit and focus.
No call? Still should’ve caught that thi
This secondary is so bad.
"Hilton played that very horribly but was still inches from breaking it up.

R-E-L-A-X. It’s one drive. And it’s the first drive, where they’ve had an entire week to scheme that up. BOB typically has a great opening script, but struggles afterwards. 

I know it’s **so fun** to give up 8 minutes in but give it time."
"Ah there’s the run, run, pass we love."
Hate all these running plays when our rb is James Conner
"Johnson with the mental error, incoming big play for him to rollercoaster our emotions"
[Ben in a nutshell](https://imgur.com/a/nVX9Nk5)
A slow start for the offense and half of you guys have declared it the worst offense you’ve seen and the year is over.
Texans have a helluva punter
Our secondary is absolutely atrocious
Good Lord this defense makes me so angry. I'm having flashbacks of Cockrell and the boys from back in the day
Wow...I really wish the offense tried something there
Keith Butler is just as bad as Fichnter.
Jesus Christ what is that the 5th drop today?
Why check down on long 3rd and goal.
great drive to be stopped by 2 drops smh
Is Ben really throwing the ball that hard or can no one catch right now?
I understand this is only game 3 but this team is a mess right now. They gotta do better than this if they hope to go somewhere this season.
"Everyone that's shitting on Ben, remember where we were last year without him."
Did Fitchner just switch to Houston's team... 3 RB play calls in a row?
Colquitt is....worse than Berry?
"Texans outta gas. It's all 3 n out from here for watson.


Time to put the squeeze on"
THATS WHY YOU DONT FUCKING RUN
AV can't hold a block to save his life my goodness
PI?
"# HIRE TODD HALEY

We will not settle for 2 yard drives anymore! 😤"
Steelers need a peanut punch training camp.
I am feeling....not great
You guys know watson is really good and it's almost impossible for a defense to cover for like 5 seconds right? He's going to make some plays fucking relax
That look of horror on Johnson's face realizing TJ is completely unblocked.
"IM
HORNY 
OMG"
Punch this in and seal it. None of the kneeling shit.
3-2-1... 3-0
why has Mike hilton been better than minkah fitzpatrick all season
Woof.  Elite defense my ass!  We did not look good that drive.
We cannot be considered an elite defense this point into the season
These refs are ass lol we probably should’ve got a personal foul there
"I say it every year, but it blows me away every year how toxic this sub can be on gameday."
"Blame the Rooney’s and Management for this shit. They refused to hire a better defensive coordinator with the idea being “its the players fault they suck, we just need better players”

Well the defense is littered with 1 and 2 round picks, yet they still get embarrassed at will and no one is even close to the ball. 

Keith Butler needs to go. Period."
"Hey it’s OK to say Ben isn’t having a good game because he’s not. It’s not the play calling, it’s not the receivers. Ben is missing open guys, throwing behind receivers, and forced two passes into Claypool last drive."
People. Calm the fuck down.
Maybe don't 0ut Vince on brandin cooks.
Bince on a 4.3 Brandin Cooks. Lmao
"you know its a good day when Randall ""Corn on the"" Cobb burns us for a TD"
Damn Hilton looked like a bitch there.
Would be nice to see Minkah show up at some point.
"Not ideal tbh. Bunch already said it, but run run pass ain’t gonna cut it lol"
[deleted]
"Next on offense. Reverse to Johnson for a loss.  Bubble screen for no gain. Connor runs for 4yds. Punt.

If this happens I’m turning off the game..."
I swear this team has the IQ of a first time pee wee football player.
Farmer's trying to low key tell you they'll get you off on manslaughter charges if you stick with them long enough.
How can our offense possibly keep up with ravens.
"This offense is the dumbest shit I've ever seen..run a fucking slant, pick play, out, curl, fucking anything other than all go routes."
Goddamn Vince. Tell us how you really feel
This defense is a joke but after that deep shot into double coverage on 3rd and 6 I had a feeling it was gonna go this way
How the fuck you gonna let him complete that pass
"So I’m not an expert, so please correct me if I’m talking out of my arse. But our secondary, and particularly Bush and Minkah, seem really fucking good at making plays whenever they get to the receiver as they catch the ball, yeah?

SO WHY THE FUCK DO WE PLAY ZONE COVERAGE AND LET THEM FUCKING WALK INTO TEN YARDS OF SPACE?"
Intentional grounding has to be the stupidest penalty of all time. Aren't we trying to protect the QB?
"On that Ebron TD catch, would you consider that a ""fade""? I am arguing with my son about what constitutes a fade pass."
Run run pass? Puke emoji
Nelson lol you have got to be kidding
Wow this secondary is doo doo
"no pressure someone always wide open

feelsbadman"
Deshaun Watson showing Steelers fan's he's arguably a top 5 QB in the league.
I....was led to believe this defense was top 5???
Steven Nelson looks exactly like Artie Burns man. What is happening?
Ravens game is gonna be something
What happened to TJ Watt?
bill is 37-3 when they lead at the half? jesus christ.
Why do we continue to use prevent defense with so much time on the clock?
Trying to stay optimistic about this cause we're only down 4 points but what the fuck happened to the D? they were genuinely elite last year and now its like shades of 2015/2016 with this secondary
2 terrible calls in a row lol
Villanueva is so trash
Conner sucks ugh
Oh look another mistake by #78
BOSGOD
Ben is hitting these dudes in the hands.
Turnover incoming I feel it
[deleted]
JUGS machine for Washington and Conner. 4 star high schoolers would have caught those.
"I still think we win, but we are playing like shit."
INSERT SOME SORT OF SWITZER COMMENT
Draw on second and 19 as if we’re playing Madden against an 8 year old
I think it’s time for Minkah to pick 6 now
Is TJ hurt or just taking some plays off?
I CALLED IT
"Run 2 yards
Run 5 yards
Pass that’s someone drops comming up"
Why can’t James consistently run hard like this? I swear some games a gust of wind rolls through the stadium and he goes down.
Rather see Conner back there in this situation
"I would've loved for Claypool to just go down after getting the first down, but the rookie will learn."
"This is the most Pittsburgh shit ever.

No injuries, 2 weeks of getting it figured out, an opponent that is weak on offense, and we look like we walked outta bed outside of JuJu back flipping for 1sts."
99.9% of people don’t understand football in this sub. You do realize that one touchdown doesn’t mean the season is over and that our defense is garbage.
"Quit panicking yinz. We always start slow, we got this."
well...we finally face a decent team and we get exposed. Not surprised ig
the refs allowing deshaun to extend plays while they hold watt inches from a sack is infuriating.
[deleted]
"Wake the fuck up Renegades, we've got a game win."
Hello from California! Let's get this win Steeler Nation <3
"Here we go, Steelers, here we go! The standard is the standard and things of that nature."
WATSON FINNA GET EXPOSED
Derek pancakes JJ on Power G and Conner scores a TD....calling it now.
I don’t normally gamble on the Steelers because they are too damn flukey. But I like the 3.5 spread in this game. I think they take it by at least 7.
Finally some Ian Eagle in my life.
Anybody got a stream going of the game?
"I benched David Johnson in fantasy, don't make me regret it."
I really have been looking forward to this game in particular just because of what it would mean to win this
"Steelers now, Heat later! Let’s ride"
So Watt's going on today?
I dont know why I\`m so nervous
I worry about Watson surviving the day. We already broke one quarterback.
Good stop. Let's goo
"Who wants to keep count on how many times the watt brothers are mentioned, I feel like a lot already"
Three and out baby!!
Ayy no post punt commercial
Juju strong af
What the fuck we didn't run it?
ATTA WAY TO STRETCH JUJU
Wow. Juju
"Juju, I love you dude"
we need to keep juju please
JuJu a fucking beast.
Conner getting some yards early. Yes
Aight conner I see you
"JuJu with the field awareness, knew where the line was and got it"
We get to play with Conner this week? I dig it.
Wow he is fast
Derek vs JJ on that McFarland run
James Conner showing some real patience there
Ben looking crisp.
ONE damn yard
"Coulve been a TD but ill take it, offense moving well"
So fucking underwhelming
We were charging down the field. I think we should have went for it there.
Go for it
[deleted]
TJ strong
What insightful commentary
Williams on Cooks...
"""over cooked"" lol"
Jesus Christ
We needed to get more pressure on that drive.
The Texans o-line is doing a lot better than I thought they would be.
Alright Hilton shake it off
Gotta step it up Steelers
"Man after the second half last and week and now this game, our secondary really isn’t that great anymore huh?"
"Imagine giving it to Jaylen Samuels on 3rd and 1 and expecting results, great call Randy..."
Houston is desperate for a win can’t underestimate the danger of a desperate team
Defense needs to figure a way to defend the quick passing game. We'll be seeing it all season
"We gotta score on this possession.

The one curse with being a dominant run defense, is that they’re just going to throw the ball every play.  Doable in 05’.  Not 2020."
"This secondary is night and day compared to last season, idk what the fuck Butler changed but put it back the way it was.... NOW!"
"To you idiots blaming Minkah, what the fuck are you talking about?! He’s not even getting targeted."
I'm fine with us taking the first quarter to figure shit out on defense and offense. Give up the TD and that's fine. Just learn from it.
Something does seem different with the defensive scheme
"If there’s no pressure this game is over. Watson will pick them apart, especially if Haden continues to dog it and they keep targeting Bush/Edmonds/Hilton"
Now would be a good time to put it together in the secondary
"3rd and medium..goody

Can't wait for a run play"
Man Randy let's call some better plays for fuck sakes.
"Bruh, run run pass?"
Beautiful
A+ playcalling as ususal
Now we get to play from behind woohoo. Step the fuck up defense.
It's going to be one of those games
We should try a bubble screen
Lets see if our defense can redeem itself
We need to get the momentum back. Big time.
I’m really surprised Ben hung onto that ball. Took a shot on the arm with only one hand on it
We cannot be scared of 4th and 1 inside the 20 bro. Settling for 3 is gonna haunt us if we can’t figure it out on defense
Bince!
First quarter has not been great. We better get our shit together soon
BINCE
the Texans look like the steelers and the steelers look like the texans 🤨
"Me: *Googles take-out near me*

Google: Taco Bell? McDonalds? Wendys? Church's? Burger King? Subway? Oliver Garden?"
"Why in fucks sake did we change our offensive play calling from first to second drive. It was obviously working. Fuck this coaching staff, damn."
🅱️ince
Defense woke up after that last drive
THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SEND EXTRA RUSHERS AT HIM
Ok. Now Minkah go get that ball
Hilton Fuckin flying
"It took us a long time to get to Watson on first down.

I'm not upset but it just feels like he has forever to throw"
My Cousin Vinny with the sack attack!
Mike Hilton!!
I fear third and long.
Fair catch at the 4???
Back to back plays for a loss? That's my defense!
Just let it roll out
Gud jahb gud jahb
Jeez Diontae thinks way too much on punt returns
Godamnit diontae
WHY CATCH THAT?!?!? Our special teams is straight ass.
Does diontae smoke blunts before the game? Love him but that was questionable af
Godamnit diontae
3 weeks in a row where Johnson fucks up on a punt return?
IN THE COCK
DJ what the fuck was that! Cmon man
[deleted]
"The D hasn’t been amazing to start they year but I think they will get better throughout the season. The one thing I’ve been really pleased about though, is tackling. Our tackling this year compared to years past is exponentially better."
Reddit is really dragging along for me
looks like Ola went down there
Ah yes the goal line bomb
This offense looks ill in these last 6 or so quarters. Like they luck into nice plays and drives.
WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS HAPPENING
"Short run deep miss deep miss, this game is over"
Lets go back to that first drive..
Jesus christ why?!
Dial it back a bit there Fit Ben.
Who is Ben passing to? 3 guys coverage
DAYUM!
Holy shit
Alright boys this is definitely 2008 2.0
This offensive play calling is maddening.
His name is Vince Williams
BINCE is nasty
Need a TO
Helpless secondary
This secondary . . .
"Losing to a team whose coach is like the owner, gm, janitor, and head coach"
OMFG
Minkah and Nelson are not impressing me today.
Our secondary is getting exposed by a good qb. Gonna be a long season
We legit just sit in zone and wait what a joke
This zone we’re playing is soooooft
What is up with our secondary playing so loose?
Man.. this secondary is the weak link
Ooh man that was a tremendous play call. Right in between Minkah’s 3rd and Nelson’s 3rd.
Holding used to be called too annoyingly now they don’t call it at all when it’s blatantly obvious
"He got BUSHED!



YYYEEEEEAAAAHHHH"
Yeah this defense is overrated.
Are we still selling out to stop the run?
Hahahahahaha what a joke
Imagine seeing our secondary play like this and still ever trying a run play. How fucking bad are O’Brien and the Texans OC to even try it?
They should try letting teams think they can run. Secondary can't handle the work load.
Bush playing better pass D than the secondary
"Our secondary just taking the first half off, huh?"
Cam and Tuitt need to push up the middle
That's a big one for bush because that was IN that guys hands
P a i n
This defense has no heart I swear
Easy completion on a scramble? Figured
Fml
hm! didn’t like that!
Bruh... this sucks
Holy fucking shit make a play
"Honeymoon's over, boys.  Time to get to work and not make this a trap game."
One thing I don't love about our DBs is how much off coverage we play. I would love to see some more press.
🤷🏻‍♂️
"So how's the offense gonna respond? 2 runs out if shotgun and a deep ball that falls incomplete. 3 and out, probably."
We need this to get some damn motivation. Getting our ass handed to us
"Tomlin's team as ""unbuttoned"" as ever."
Fucking sitting in zone just letting WR's get set up and waiting for the throw from Watson
SO our defense isn't showing up and we cant run a offense who do I blame for this? The coordinators?
"Why do we always need these ""wake up"" games where we get lambasted and then collectively go ""oh shit we need to do *this*"""
This could get ugly quick
"This is embarrassing, but pretty ball is being played by the Texans today.."
"If we don’t score this drive, then I’ll start to worry slightly. We gotta answer"
"Ok guys, its 1st and 10. Lets do this thing called a screen play, those always end with a lot of yards."
"Really need this secondary to wake up man. Nelson Haden and Minkah will be the downfall of this defense, this team."
NICE BLOCKING AND RUN NEWBIE
Omg offense why cant you just not disappoint our defense.
I said it over and over again last week. Now do you believe me? This defense is too dependent on turnovers. Their scheme isn’t up to snuff.
Ring the bell
That deserved to be picked
Yikes I almost thought it was picked...good play vance
Get McFarland in open space and we in business
Our secondary communication seems to be very off. People completely blowing assignments. Vince Williams lining up across from Cooks. My hope is communication can be fixed and hopefully we can shut things down in the second half.
I feel like we are so much better when playing man. Whenever we play zone it feels like someone blows their assignment and they have someone wide open... Any thoughts on that?
Meatballs are ready lets fuckin go
Look at that! Ebron caught one!
Like that play call! Thats what you should do on 3rd and 1. Great 3rd effort by Snell
TRICK PLAY
Pancake for #7
Dionte hurt
Well executed reverse
SHADES OF COWER
dj was slow getting up
There ya go Ebron!
Say Go DJ! That's my DJ
Got to score here
how did we not get that
"Come on, punch it in baby"
Ebron runs like he is made out of clay.
Where is jujuuuu
Good thing there's no fans there to boo right now
Sneak it
Ben run 1 yard lol
Get chase in there
"Okay am I high or was that grounding

Edit: it was"
fuckin mint
Ebron or claypool
Let’s gooooooo!!!!!
Ebron!!!!
ugly
HOLY FUCK
Follow the fullback not Ebron
What a catch
Fuck off
FUCK YA
THERE YOU GO
Does Vance look lost to anyone else? I'm pretty sure he was supposed to leak out to the end zone on that play
EBRON WITH THE BIG BOY GRAB
good shit ebron
LeBron without the L!
Heeeeeeeeeeeeath
Dam what a catch !!!!!!
"Holy shit, they fuckin did it"
Thank you big E!!!!
Let's fucking go
HANDS
That was a pretty solid drive.
How will the defense respond?
Ebron szn
Ebron you sexy man
YES SIRRR
Damn. Great toss by Ben
Do your thing defense
Okay time for the front 7 to make a splash play to bail out the secondary and get our offense back out there while they're still clicking.
Fire sale on that sack
Dam I thought that ball was coming out
"Good stop, boys."
Great stand by the D. Let's close this deficit
Nice stop. Let’s do the double dip with the half.
TEEEE JAYYYYYYYYY
good starting field position come on bois
Ray ray is so good
there we gooo blitzburgh
Tackled by moron special teams? That seems harsh.
Okay offense let's get it done again and take the lead before the half so we get the ball back in the second half. Fucking scorched Earth on these Texan bastards.
"A bit late, but I love Ebron, and I am so happy seeing him score. Looked just like my Madden fantasy team."
2 minute ben drive plz
Good catch Juju
"Look I don't get paid shit to football, but if I was on offense and I ran on first down, unless I got at least 6 yards I would not run it again on second down. I'd rather run short crosses, out routes, hitches whatever quick passes to get a first down instead of run again and get stuffed."
Reminder to everyone that overreacted abotu 10 gametime minuets ago (myself included)... we get the ball to start the 2nd half
Nice
JUJU BAYBE
TD JUJU
JUJU MUTHAFUCKA
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
Big Ben FOR LIFE
Washington James Washington 7 foot 20 Washington.
That was a beautiful drive!
Let’s. Fucking. Go baby
So that just happened.
"That was beautiful, now let's get out of this half and do it all over again at the top of the second."
There we go!!! Juju with the walk in is always beautiful
thats an odd zone
PLAYING LIKE WE HAVE SOMETHING TO LOSE NOW LETS KEEP IT UPPPP
"I was mad early, now im happy"
Just let Ben be Ben
Now we are having fun ☀️
Everything tightening up. Looking strong. Here we go.
Ben is warming up
Voodoo Juju 🧙🏼‍♀️ it’s spooky!
Steelers started 1-4 on third down but converted their last three
Juju just Hoovering TDs
Edmunds is our best tackles
"""Big Ben is feeding his Tight-End""

Niceeee."
Claypool has consistently been wide open but Ben isn't looking his way.
"Will be give up a garbage FG, I bet we dooooo"
"Secondary, plz."
This secondary is just...
This zone is getting picked apart
If the defense got a turnover I would be soooo happy.
Tighten up defense
really edmunds? really?
Why the duck was Aikens wide open there? Good lord man..
kinda wish we didn't score too fast but i mean...
edmunds has not progressed in coverage since he got here.
Maybe they will get a TD.... then I’ll panic
Hilton is getting cooked this game
Sack right here is huge
Half the damn team was open
Hahahahahahahah Hahahahah
That was not ideal.
Yeesh... just bend over for them
That was just so easy
Secondary. What are you doing?
can we score in 25 seconds? :O
FIRE DAMNY SMITH
Nelson exposed
we cannot defend the pass. period. edmunds is trash in coverage. our entire secondary has been getting owned this year.
"So yeah, at a certain point it's not the talent. It's the scheme and the coaching. Needs to change ASAP."
This defense gives me 2016 vibes
"Watson to comfortable out there man, gotta get some pressure"
Does anyone have a livestream link?
Washington is making Cleveland look like playoff contenders
is halftime over yet? wtf feels like ages
Guys if we can make it 2 quarters more without a turn over we wont have to be reminded of that one ugly stat every game
3 bubble screens! Do it you cowards?
Hey! You! Get off of McCloud!!
ZERO holding penalties on opposing offenses this year
Like what I’m seeing from McFarland so far for the most part.
That spot...
I really like this McFarland kid
"I’m liking what I’m seeing from McFarland tonight

Although maybe let’s not send our rapid but pretty small RB straight up the middle"
"God dammit.


When is the last time we converted 3rd and inches. Fuck"
That NFL bite website is a fucking disaster. It just opens a fuck load of tabs. I really wish this free shit would improve the formats.
"There we go!


Alright Conner"
Really?  Seriously?  Our speed back on a half yard play
"what the fuck was that spot, that was a first down"
"Washington is just a lunchpale receiver.

Hard worker, strong hands."
"Shit, non contact just fell."
These deep balls yeesh
Is that Houston's 2nd hurt Dback this game?  Come on... have to be able to light them up now
That’s a TD if Ben stops overthrowing
"No more deep throws for you, Ben. That’s what, 4, that were war far over thrown?"
DB’s always pulling their hammy when they get beat deep
he got it!
Big Ben with the burners.
gonna be interesting this see this offense 8-10 games from now. i dont feel like they are clicking quite yet cause of the offseason and bens surgery. the best is yet to come.
DJ is out
That’s a first
It's pretty obvious he got that
Looks like a bad spot. They rarely change it though
Sick fuckin spot
whats taking so long wtf lol
So we ordered Sharkeys (Latrobe PA) and my fiancé got a typical burgers with all the goodies. They brought me a fucking burger with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches as the buns and no toppings. I’m irate
Omfg
Ben “fast Willy Parker” Roethlisberger
"Fuck these refs, 0 opposing holding calls all season too"
You’re fucking kidding
Robbed
Ben is the best RB in the league
Are you fucking kidding me
Bullshit
Ummmm are we going to talk about how that bomb to Washington was COMPLETELY catchable???
WTF?  That seemed pretty definitive.
What a terrible ref crew
"How tf, look at the ball when his knee was down"
How do they still fuck that up after the review
that was easily a first down
That's clearly a 1st down. Fucking refs
This is a fucking joke
Bullshit
Thanks Chase Claypool way to sell that
That's BS
Horseshit
Refs forgot to use their eyeballs today
Trash. Straight trash
That was a shit call
We finally get a call! Good job claypool
Lmao fuck these refs
Not even going to spot it more...wtf
Wow thats bullshit but thats the most normal thing in 2020 so I’ll take it lol
Had ebron wide open but ill take that makeup call
"""Call stands"" or ""Yes, that spot was terrible but we won't overturn that shit""."
How the fuck do you not overturn that call? That's absolute trash.
"Ok refs, refs OK..."
THE BALL WAS THERE REGARDLESS OF HIS KNEE
Rigged
WHAT?!?!
"BULLSHIT!

Jesse caught that ball 2! Electric bugaboo!"
Joe flacco play
LETS GO
Randy Fichtner getting bailed out big time today
I’m glad we got the pass interference call but wasn’t there someone wide open at the bottom of the screen?
Makeup call??
Alberto Riverton fucking things up again
They will not admit the spot mistake
"YEAH, PAY UP"
Ball don't lie?
Awfulw playcall but geez
That's not a bad challenge stop crucifying tomlin
Fuck these refs
Wtf
Make up for the make up call
Two shitty calls...but not complaining
Make up call lol
L O L
Nice Makeup Call
"I don’t get makeup calls, just call it right the first time???"
We’re only getting 3 huh....
We need to catch some balls    😡
Honestly that’s the second time he could’ve been called for that
Shut up refs I’m tired now
That play call lmao
Johnson and Watt ruled out
Ben! What the fuck was that rocket?!
Why can’t we catch?
Well its only 2 Watt’s playing now
Gotta catch that
Bruh
BOZGAWD
Why did Ben throw that?
someone catch the fucking ball.
"this drive really doesn't matter that much.

either the D steps up in the second half or we lose. it's that simple."
So do we know if TJ is hurt?
Defense needs a turn over. C'mon guys
A THREE AND OUT
Ray Ray McDonald
C’mon get off the field here
A stop 🤔
God damn!!
Did he not call fair catch??
Did we just get help from STs? What is this voodoo
"Ray Ray is Mr. Excitement, the last few years have been Dredd."
Ray ray got that off spray applied
Can’t wait for Ray Ray to bust one.  He looks soooooo close to breaking out for a TD every time.
Good job blocking
Our special teams is so much better than the last few years. Mr. Big Wad getting the most out of these players
No one cares about the border wall
Ben needs to be better at throwing the ball away holy shit
Time to punt
Well at least he caught 8t
Ugly
"How's the border wall going? I know I can't really comment on American politics at the moment (being a Brit) but come on, how silly"
Is it fake time?
It would be nice if the receivers ran to the sticks and then committed to their routes but oh well.
2nd and fucking NINETEEN. WHAT IS THAT PLAY CALL
Go for it.
Or they let us do the Steelers thing where we blow the game. Either one works.
How is cbs still in business? They’re like the blockbuster of television.
We need a great splash play from the defense
I am ready for a turnover
Time for a quick INT
Would rather take a screen or a quick concept on 2nd and length of the universe instead of a run.
HAVE to force a turnover here or we ain't stopping them
HOW IS THAT NOT HOLDING AGAINST WATT
DO IT TUITT
Do it Tuitt
Nice!!!
COME ON RAY RAY!!!!!
LETS DO IT TUITT!!!!
There he is!!!
"Great field position, WE NEED 7"
You thought you could escape Tuitt?! You thought wrong mother fucker!!
Gotta say... Houston has some great player names... a punter named Anger and a LB named Merciless.
How about play action on first down?
Did the Texans just swap us punters?
I miss having receivers who caught the ball
So ya’ll gonna blame Ben some more?
oh FFS
Love it when ben pumps out the camera lmao
Of course we get a 3 & out
No. More. Big throws BEN! Start pulling a Brady and just get yards.
No one can hold onto the ball today :(
I feel like every weapon is getting a drive instead of spreading it around.
Bruhhh what
BLOCK IN THE BACK WE’RE GETTING FUCKIN PIPED HERE
Thang god BoB is horrible
So easy for him to get quick completions
I liked that Coor's commercial 😂
Always open...
WHO THE FUCK BLEW THAT ASSIGNMENT??
He was past the line of scrimmage.
"Third and 10, fuck."
Fucking garbage zone
Wow great play by Watt
Fuckkkkk our secondary is a bag of ass
Watt blew that shit up!
It would  be nice to see minkah make a big play
"Bad defense today. Looks like scheme more than effort, don’t see anyone loafing out there."
LETS GOOO
Hilton!!!
Finally a pick
There she is
LETS GO MIKEYYYY
Nice!
THERE IT IS
Finally.
Pls offense
PICKED LETS GO
Watson’s head slammed so hard on the ground
Wtf are these commercials
Defense has stepped up big time second half. Offense needs to score now
No blockers over there and you're gonna screen huh? Fuckin joke of a Play call
Man I should have started Ebron today in fantasy
I am enjoying the play of this Ebron fellow
Let Ben call his own plays
Ebronhaving himself a game!
Atta boy Connor
Good run after contact Conner
"Sorry to ask, any streams for the game?"
Man Ebron has been great for us this game
Connor looked like he got hurt there
uh oh texans D. A little exhausted are we?
I’m getting shades of Xavier Grimble from Ebron. But in a good way
BennyBall
"Conner looks so slow when he gets the ball, no explosiveness"
What in the hell was that throw?
Fuck Big Ben with the over throws today damn.
BIG TRAIN VANCE 🚂
I guess Ben's repaired arm is stronger than his injured arm :)
Just me that thinks JC is afraid of putting his head down and earning a yard or two..?
Connor needs to learn to put his head down when he’s only got a couple yards left
I'm gonna call that a Health Miller special to Vance... because I just miss Heath today
Vance getting up from the knee was hilarious
Texans are gassed....pound the rock
I get sick to my damn stomach seeing Conner miss first downs because he hesitates :( Thats two times this drive I feel like he misread and missed a first down cause of it.
Vance just trucked that dude. I like it.
TOUCHDOWN
TD Conner
LETS GO DEFENSE LETS FUCKING GO
Way to punch that shit in!!
😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
Fuck yeah holy shit
FUCK YEAH
[Let's Go D!](https://youtu.be/J79L31W_ZWc)
Let's goooo baby!!! 🔥🔥
LETS GOO
"Whew juju made that close, hope they don't review it. Nice job though!"
"Alright boyssss time the pull out the ol' ""the same shit that happened at the end of the first half"" and then get the ball last and win it on a Boswell field goal. Woo hoo!!"
DPOY ALERT
BIG SACK
WATT
holy shit tj
Jesus Tj is a fucking animal
TJ WATTT YESSSSSS
WATTTTTT!!
TJ WATTTTTTTTTTT
Watt has some magic too!
1.21 TJ WATTS!!
PUMP THAT SHIT DIRECTLY INTO MY VEINSSS!!!!! TJJJJJJ
Let's gooooo!!
MY MAN LETS GO
Well one good thing about starting so slow all the time is we are a very good 4th quarter running team.
TJ WATT YOU FUCKING MONSTER I LOVE YOU!!
OHHHH A PICK THERE WOULDA BEEN SICK
TJ is looking so much better than his brothers.
We played Renegade in our house
He's gonna be seeing TJ in his sleep
Watt looks amped.
Man TJ what a freaking beast
LETS. FUCKING. GO.
Another tipped pass
Our D showed up! Here we go!!!
✊🏻
"Steelers defense is sorta good, who knew?"
Remember when JJ was the highest paid player? I guess it's going to be TJs turn...
I bet they’re missing the crowd now
Time for Haden to get a PI or a pick.
Time to wrap this baby up.
GOOOOOD STOP
my house is currently flooded from the amount of stress sweat ive got goin
Conner time
I guess if I was going to pick what quarter we play best in 4th is a good choice but it is the most nerve wracking way to play.
Can we not do that thing where we try and run time off the clock and just go for points to end the game.
Plz don’t keep them in the game... plz... I can see what’s coming but plz prove me wrong
alright JC
Time of possession is wearing them out
"Incredible 2nd half by the D. Let's burn some clock, get at least 3 and take it to next week!"
Well I would LOVE Connor to go down inbounds to eat up clock... but a 1st an not really hit is never bad for him and his health.
LOOK AT DEM BLOCKS BOYS
That's a great start by James
This Texans defense is gassed.
"Nice run. Wish he would have stayed inside of Washington and in bounds, but still a nice run."
Great run. Stay in fucking bounds.
Finish them!!!
Mc's block taking two players down..lol
wE dOnT mAkE 2Nd HaLf AdJuStMeNtS
Go for it
"Stupid question here, but why not handoff to Vance McDonald in these 4th and short situations?"
Go for it
YESSSS FUCK YESSSSS
"Ball.



Game."
Would’ve been the longest fg in Heinz history good decision to go for it
Go for it? Yikes I don’t like the position.
Honestly a tough choice here.
THANK GOD
Aha now that’s what I’m freaking talking about
Eat that clock and keep driving Steelers!
Great playcall I’m loving that
Bit of a risky call there.  I love it.
"I'm not a NFL coach but I'd take the 2 minute warning instead, timeouts are too useful"
Claypool!
JESUS dude my heart
WHEW
Didn't go into the end zone
Jesus tapdancing Christ... the 1st was more than enough.  But putting it to the 1 is money
Holy shit that was close
What a play call
That could have been disaster.
My.  Goodness!
What the fuck did charles davis just say lmao
Sooooo close to a touch back
WHEW
You like that?!?!!
Ball game
My opponent has Watson. Please kneel three times
"Great second half, man. Way to adjust."
How did Buffalo blow it
3-0
3-0
WE DID IT
Wow good stuff fam
3-0 baby!!!
"Hell of a game, much love all <3"
This secondary and Keith Butler about to get exposed. ...This is going to be painful to watch.
We’re about to get blown out
Our secondary is so fucking trash
I will die on the Switzer hill no matter what. Consistency>>>>>explosive plays
Fichtner has to go
How can you invest so much in a defense and still have it suck so bad
Gave up 21 points in a half to a team that doesn’t have any legit title aspirations based on their defense and O line. What a god awful half of football by then against an inferior opponent at home.
Why can't we just stick to the script and *win* when we're supposed to blow teams out of the water? Every game has to be a heart attack nail biter and i won't even be able to watch the end cuz i work on sundays. Just *ONCE* I'd like to leave with a comfortable lead and have it stay that way
Where are all the people saying earlier our defense is trash and James Connor sucks?
James Connor needs to go
"Hey I expected a 3 and out, ill take 3"
Bruh why the fuck is Williams covering Cooks
Defense picking up right where they left off last week.
The blitz isn’t hitting and our dbs can’t keep up. It’s going to be a long day playing a real qb.
If you get the ball past the line of scrimmage against us we are fucked lmao
Run run pass?
Love seeing yinzers absolutely lose their shit over seeing a football team run the ball twice in a row
Ben just got PLOWWWEDDD
Anyone miss Switz.
Holy shit I'm concerned all of a sudden. Ben is making wtf decisions.
[deleted]
Still early
Is minkah gonna do anything this season or nah
Hmmmm our O line not rushing to help conner might say something...
I don’t like conners running. He’s soft and weak. Glad they are mixing it up with the backs.
How does Connor not make those yards?
"Nice, great way to end the drive with a single play call"
What... that is NOT intentional grounding!   Through the endzone was always permitted????
Pleeeeeease O. Please get us some points before halftime. We need to carry this momentum.
Oh there you are Run Run Pass...
Run run pass
Run run pass
"Fuckin whiners and haters where you at

Crawl back into your holes"
Minkah has not looked great so far. This is like the third time I’ve seen him in the area of the catch not making a play
Nelson didnt even try!!!!!!!!
Nelson got Bitched
Jesus Christ. Like a knife through butter
Wtf happened to our secondary
Breath guys. It’s the September Steelers.
"Here comes a 80+ touchdown pass to JuJu or Claypool.

Please?"
"Steeler's D is honestly playing like they all bet on the Texan's today. Enough to ""look"" like they're playing hard, but hardly playing."
"watson is 14/18 for 202 yards and 2 tds.   
ben is 11/18 for 128 yards and 2 tds.   


ooof. 3 more completions and nearly 70 more yards."
Thats two shit calls if I ever saw some... That was more OPI than DPI.
Gotta hit the jugs machine this week. Fuck
easy td if they could catch the damn balls
CATCH THE BALL
Her jersey should be 2/3rds steelers lol.
"Great stop, let's go."
Texans offensive coordinator taking a page from Steelers.
"Texans stealing our offense! Run, run, pass"
"This Dan Fouts replacement, Charles Davis, sucks.  He's interjecting so many assumptions and arguments based on personal feelings rather than valid premises that's it's hard to listen to him.  Just call the F'ng game, stop trying to push your feelings of the matters.  Still better than Fouts though, and 1000x better than Simms."
Run on 2nd and 19 nice
2nd and 19 run? The fuck?
I like the running call as a surprise but what idiot goes for 19 through the center??
Maybe someday we’ll draft a punter that doesn’t suck
"Colquitt stinks, officially"
Turnover time for our D.  I’m feeling it!
Not winning this game without a defensive score.  Here We Go
Bleh... don't throw that high and thats an easy first down Ben
Wasn't TikTok banned by Trump?  Why are we still getting commericals for it?
"I kinda hate seeing knees within 5 yards of the endzone... but take the win, don't risk shit.   Still bleh"
"now. trade edmunds. for someone who can cover people. maybe bob woodward.  


and get watt on this team."
Glad for the result but why even call the second down play? You're on the one yard line. Just power it in.
"You guys are so whiny and negative... ffs.

Put your phones down and watch the game."
Fuck Randy Fichtner
Conner is so mediocre
Can we get a coach that makes it FUCKING EASY for once.
Hey you may not want to hear this but the defense got lucky last year that they played so many bad QBs. The secondary always sucked
The Texans are going to score 40 points in this game.
Nelson and Minkah have regressed significantly this season
Our pass defense is overrated
tj is out
[deleted]
Ben will definitely blame Washington for that
YoU jUsT kNoW hOuStOn Is GoNnA sCoRe HeRe!
Wtf was that dogshit punt? I could do better than that
[deleted]
Ben + White tight ends = BFFs
This ones over early. Steelers aren’t as good as we thought.
the second quarter literally just started can you guys calm down
remember that one guy we got i think his name is Fitzpatrick
[deleted]
Sucks the Texans already won though
"""We are going to lose, our play calling is so bad."" DOES YOUR PUSSY HURT? WAKE TF UP STEELERS NATION!"
What's the surrender index on that kneel. Coward shit.
Kick the FG definitely
Imagine if we had a good play caller.
why do steelers still have this dumbass as our offense coordinator
"So far we've seen Connor, Jaylen, and McFarland at RB. I am liking them mixing it up"
Praise be to Bosgod. He’s still a killer B in my eyes.
"Fuuuuuudge.


Except I didn't say fudge"
uh oh stinky
Mike Hilton is only good as a tiny linebacker
Defense feelin' themselves to much??
One touchdown and everyone loses their minds lol plenty of time to get a dub so chill
"Vince Williams, Terrell Edmunds, and Mike Hilton are liabilities only coverage. Sutton needs more playing time on obvious passing downs or the defense won’t be good enough."
"Idc how good this team is, our coordinators need to go."
People are still blaming Minkah for that TD. I can’t imagine being that stupid
BINCEEEEE
Who's hurt? What happened to his cock and balls
Idk why our guys aren't getting calls so fsr
Didn't someone question Ben's arm strength during the week?  It was like he needed to show it off
Feel like the offense is just too dependent on our defense. We have some of the shittiest gameplan in the league.
BEN WTF
It’s going to be a loooong afternoon.
HE WAS WIDE FUCKING OPEN HOW DOES BITCH BOY BUTLER HAVE A JOB
Just run prevent defense if you're going to stand 10 yards off of all receivers
Watson is unreal
"This team feels typical. 

We will be slow to get hot. But get hot a lil to late and miss the playoffs. 

Every year. Rinse and repeat."
We're relying so hard on the blitz it's a joke
"Face a good QB, get exposed. Baltimore or KC would absolutely thrash us"
"Hard to cover guys in a zone for 5 seconds against a mobile QB.

Looked like Minkah/Bush(?) lost Fuller in on of their zones when Deshaun took off. Have to respect him running toward the LOS.

Just a tough spot there."
Are we finally waking up?
QB sneak coming up.
Omfg intentional grounding
"God Damn, 1 yard guys"
Can’t score from 1 yard out
FUCK YOU REFS
"Jesus. Okay, maybe the playcalling suspect"
TAKE IT ALL BACK LOSERS
"I’d like to see them go for the kill here vs running the clock out cause we get the ball in the second half.

Somebody needs to throw out the 1970s nfl offensive playbook they keep using. Seriously, let Ben run go hurry up here and take the lead now and then come out in the second and keep fucking piling on."
You guys were throwing in the towel 15 minutes ago. Let’s go baby
Our defense is fucking buns today
This is fucking pathetic defence
Nelson is baby shit soft
Embarrassing.  Simply embarrassing. They have the answers to our blitzing.
Steven Nelson sucks
Well that was pathetic.
Watson is just better than the defense. He just looks like an elite player. Would be even better if the clowns didn’t get rid of his best weapon.
What happened to them not being able to stop our pass rush...
couldn't even keep the lead musth less keep it to a tie game
how’d i just know this shit was going to happen today? the more things change..
They will never overturn this. Terrible spot nonetheless.
What a waste of a five minute drive
Worst offensive play caller in the league... Randy should go somewhere
Defense needs to make some stops. I don't think we win in a pure shootout.
2 fgs from the red zone is why we lose this game. Texans offense has our defense figured out and we can take 3s when they’re getting 7s
Really want a turnover here
Great stop. Now let’s not settle for a FG and get that TD
Feiler has been so bad this year inside. As far as I'm concerned put in Dotson lol
Okay see sacks like that I don't like.
Should have gone for it
Shitty punt
"SHIT ON MY DICK, FUCK"
MINKAH!!!!
We give up a lot of first downs on third and long
Ben has looked great this game.
Ben is still rusty.
[deleted]
Oh no we suck again
Bring back fucking Todd Haley. Dude was ass but holy shit his replacement is 10000x worse
But what name is on Al’s helmet?????
"“ThE dEfEnSe IsN’t As GoOd As LaSt YeAr!!!1”
- some random redditor with terrible football takes."
BRING BACK SWITZER
I mean this had trap game written all over it. Texans are desperate at 0-2 and let's be real with the way our offense plays we'd be 0-2 if it wasn't for us playing trash teams.
Hot take. Our defense looks like steaming garbage and I am sad.
"Who’s ready for the inevitable 3 and out to start the second half? Run-run-pass, baby."
Ben is looking extremely inaccurate.
"Fuck man, we’re never getting the lead back are we"
WE SHOULD HAVE KICKED A FIELD GOAL AND GONE FOR 3 AFTER THE TD
"Dude why the fuck is the coaching staff so incompetent on this team. Special teams is ass, play calling is ass"
For everyone who was talking shit after our defensive drive saying “if you think the defense regressed you don’t know football” it’s time to wake up. If you can’t notice even from the first 2 weeks that this defense has regressed then you’re lying to yourself. The hope is that the offense can be good and help compensate but that’s tbd.
In the very back end recesses of my mind I kinda figured our secondary was overrated. Lots of tip picks last year and lucky plays. This sucks.
Ben struggling today sailing balls.
What an upgrade to our punter /s
If only we had coaches who knew when to throw a challenge...
its like some of yall just watch the game so you can come bitch on reddit. getting so old
Ok boys. LFG.
"Going against the Steelers D in fantasy.  d'oh.

I'll take a Steelers win over a fantasy win anyday."
would anyone be so kind as to PM me link?
"First test of the season, let’s goooo"
Anyone got a stream?
Is there a way to watch or listen on a phone? I'm having to go and do shit with my baby momma today.
HERE WE GO!!!!
TJ...meet Desean
Here we go boys
Hi guys
TJ was unguarded on that play
"Don't let up on the pressure, boys!"
"TJ getting in there early to say hi to Watson.

We're gonna kill Watson today."
Strong three and out
Wow we didn't fuck up a ST play
That’s a really bold blocking scheme Houston.
MIKE HILTON IS SO GOOD
RIP Webster
Let’s maybe go under center
I want a touchdown this first drive. It’s about time we do that.
Ben has missed on his first two throws. First was too soft and second he missed an open Ebron.
Come on Ebron :/
Ahhh Ben. Make that throw
HELL YA
What in the fuck was that jump lmao
Jujuuu
Great finish there
Ben got blasted
Damnit ebron
Almost a fantastic catch. Almost.
We're looking goooooood fellas
"Yea, you can tell JuJu put some weight on in the offseason lmao"
Ebron bruh
Haha Ebron nice Mongrief impression....
Well I’m glad I benched Ebron in fantasy
Good run JC glad we got 66 back
Watch...I'm gonna throw it over that mountain
Damn he had em
Juju has the heart
"god bless it none of my usual streaming sites are working, usual go to sportsurge.net and 6stream.xyz

anybody got a good stream they can link me???"
Not on tv here :(
good call on that one
Any good streams for the game?
I guess Hawkins is our new Banner?
It's BOZGAWD TIME!!
Needed the shovel pass
Not going for it is peak clownery
BosGod
Ugh
God. Damnit.
"Don't worry, guys, we're gonna respond with a bomb to Chase Claypool"
we got the pat's punts boost curse ppl this was expected
got diced up on the drive
Streams?
"It’s called making an adjustment. Secondary slipped, but we can adjust."
Minkah was in no mans land on that TD
Omg
Great job O Line!
Surprised there has been zero holding calls
Villanueva is fucking trash
Hilton is a beast.
We’re back
"Wow.  People think running twice in a row is some terrible call.  It's pretty normal, especially when we get 5 yards on first down.

Yeesh."
"When it works it works, but my god when it doesn't we get torched lmao"
"Hilton with a great fucking tackle, wow!"
This team has so much potential that will be hamstrung all season by ol' Randy.
Ok. Let’s go.
Wtf
There you go Hilton pt. 2
Great stop by the defense.
Think ola got hit in the balls
Fair catch at the 4?
Our D didn’t give up a third and long let’s GOOOO
Diontae with his head up his ass again.
"Bud was going hard at him there, better get rid of it"
Pray for Vince balls
Gud jahb gud jahb D
Diontae what. The. Fuck.
I like Diontae but he's not the guy to return kicks.
"Big Ben 96 yard, 10+ min drive incoming."
So why did Diontae catch that one???
"Sweet, just need a 96 yard drive. fuckin' easy"
LET THAT GO
Hope he’s okay
CHASE CLAYPOOL SCUD INCOMING
Anyone know where there is a stream of this game?
"Clean it up, let's go"
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
Big Ben doesn’t look great to start this one. Hopefully he gets in a groove soon.
Fuck me
Ah yes the goal line bomb... again
Interesting use of a timeout.
Screen on third anyone!?
Mountain passing
WHAT THE FUCK
Woof
Ummm.
Cool just throw it deep....
?????
. . .
WTF is this
not even second quarter yet
Holy christ man
How about high percentage pass plays to get a first dahn!!
Ben needed Clifford Franklin on that throw...(with Stickum)
Nice job defense
Our receivers cannot get open for shit
ben not looking gr8 today
"Another easy first down...this secondary is bad.

Where are the Minkah truthers"
Love you bince but you are a liability in coverage
Secondary looks confused
He didn’t even have to fucking move to get that open
Secondary gonna need a Sam's Club supply of cocoa butter for all these burns
Minkah been quiet this season - he needs a pick
UH OH BIG STINKY
Hey if we could cover a 3rd down play and not keep giving soft as fuck zone coverage... that'd be nice.
Bud getting handled....not good.
Watson is setting this defense on fire
This secondary gives me 2016 vibes
"he doesn't even have to make hard throws, guys are wide open"
don't you just love zone defense
"So we were in man on the first drive and zone on this most recent drive?

We just not getting d line pressure in the right area or what?  Texans line seems to be handling pressure well"
Finally Bush not getting burned in coverage
What the fuck is going on with the secondary?
Man we suck lol
Alualu is so good
Has minkah had one good play so far this season
"I don’t know if I’m behind or others are. But man, this is not the game I wanted. Where the fuck is Minkah?!"
What is Minkah doing
Somebody show Fitchner that you can do 5 straight passes
How are these receivers so open
Great job Bush!!
DEVIN BUSH! GO BLUE
Guess we see what defense we have when we play a competent quarterback
jwsus fuck
fuckin' ridiculous
LOL well
Fuck
Damnnnnnnnnnnitttttttt
Wow great start.
This is the way.
That’s just Watson being good
Rudy! Rudy!
"This Defense must focus on the media too much, letting all the praise get to their heads"
Alright time for the offense to show up!
Fucking pat mcafee
Secondary is getting ROASTED
i'd be disappointed if it wasn't so easy to predict this outcome. as soon as every media pundit jumps on us vs an inferior opponent you just know we're gonna go out and lay an egg
Heres comes the big play from BEN
If our front 7 is struggling to make big plays after big plays we'll have problems winning any game.
"Oof, slab up and respond boys."

"Not gonna call it quits on the season after 1 quarter by a real good quarterback, but it seems like the Steelers absolutely need to put points up on this drive to keep them into it."
"There’s way too many people claiming the Steelers suck cause of a bad couple drives... chill. It’s early in the 2nd, anything can happen"
Great play. What a call
The defense is defending the short field over and over. The offense needs to give them a break and keep the damn ball for more than 4 plays.
It’s only the first half people. We are a Houston turnover away from this being a different game
Come on you fuck nuts. Get your shit together.
Also no carries for Snell?
There you go AMC!!
Whew that was close
VEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
GREAT BLOCK by decastro
"What was with that yell?

""OooOOAAAhhh!!!"""
Connor is so average
Why do we suck on 3rd and short lol
Should have broken that tackle. Still great job
[deleted]
I do like this two tight end with claypool at WR set
"Okay Enron, keep catching the ball"
DJ doing his Grimble impression
again the double clutch
Just don't take a sack now
Really?
Fuck
OH YEAHHHH
Ebrooonn the monsterrr
Ebron!
Late penalty too wtf
Well shit...
Ebron!
Thank God for that!
"Wow, Double E. Great job."
EBRON BABBYYYYY
Beautiful catch
LETS GO BB!!!!
"Great work, let’s get that ball back"
Good ball ben
[deleted]
Anyone got the highlight link for that one?
HIGHSMITH SIGHTING
Let's get the ball back and get into the 2 minute offense
He got mobbed
GREAT SEQUENCE D
“WAOOOOOOOO”
Defense is flying all over the field.
"I slept in and I'm just turning the game on, how have we looked so far?"
The bud tj combo
Go for the td
Fucking momentum
Ernie Mills would have returned that for a touchdown.
Two minute drill time boys. Let's do it!!
So what do you do when passing works and we’re back in striking distance? Revert right back to the run run pass of course!
Any update on johnson getting checked for concussion?
Fuck hope Johnson is okay.
Playing James at X. So now we know who the backup X is.
JUUUUUU JUUUUUUU 🚂
JUJU
Let’s go!!!!!
JUJUUUUU
I'd let Ben call al his own plays
"Once again, we have to keep Juju."
2 MINUTE BEN LETS GOOOOOOOO
JuJu Baby
CMONNN LETS GO MAN THIS IS WHY WE THROW
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BOYS
JUUUUJUUUUUUUUUUU
Offense is warming up!
Offense looks great. Obviously we can’t always score but it’s mind boggling that we either do this or we 3 and out. Gotta have more real drives moving forward
It was the jersey.  I told you.
Stop somebody!!!!!!!
That was easy.  See not so hard.
That zone is bad.
Can't give up points
We will have no problem bowers in the secondary
Well
Come onnnnnn pick six
"What a breakdown defensively for Houston. Not only was juju wide open, so was claypool"
Over/Under on Mark Madden trashing Juju soon?
Well we let them into fg range way too quick.
That Watson kid is pretty good
Broooooooo
We need some pass rush Watson had all day to throw that ball
"Ok


Get a turn over and all is forgiven"
Deshaun watmontanabreesbradyson
Well tits.
Watson does look really good today. Gotta give him that.
Fuck
He is unable to jump I guess..
How about a kick return because both teams are half assing this final kickoff?
That was just pathetic.
Boo
What happened to watt
Alex Highsmith got rooked on that TD run
Ring the bell🔔🔔🔔
If we can just play some more Man to man on defense... I don't believe we cannot handle their receiving core.  especially with Hopkins gone
Big day for Mcfarland
Dude is fast
"McFarland shouldn’t be shifty, he should hit edges"
give me 24-21.
I do not like seeing him try to run up the middle
Did the move Terrell Edmunds to RB and change his last name?
Wtf
Must QB sneak
Jesus
Can't get half a yard.
ray ray always about to break it but trips or get tripped by his own man
wait what
Fucking sneak it
Holy shit kill me
Go for it
Wow they are struggling to say Okorafor's name
McFarland 8 YPC
I do NOT like McFarland up the middle
Got hosed on the spot and then get stuffed
"yes, i love it."
Great job holding onto that
2nd most eligible receiver!  And the first down
We better not punt. Go for it!
Can someone tell me how we are doing? I missed most of the first half. Give me the run down
can we at least get a fg :x
Big Ben
Ben: https://youtu.be/Xw1k20DpHfA
"If his knee hit, he's short. I couldn't see it"
Wowwwwww
Lol of course we lose the challenge.
FUCK THESE REFS
Diontae is out the rest of the game
Silly Ben had that
Bullshit
Need Haskins to turn it on and beat the Brown
I hate that nothing is ever overturned.
Wow did we get lucky there....
HOW THE FUCK
these refs are actually losing us this game
Bailed out!
Well thank god for the penalty cause that was not going to be completed.
Jesus H Fuck these guys.
REFBALL
Fucking garbage man.
What the fuck
"It worked. 


4th and short bomb -> flag"
WE ARE SOO LUCKY
NICEEEEEEE
WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!?!
Yeah he altered the route to catch the ball you dumbass
Possible make up call
Oop back to back bad calls.  I’ll take it though I guess.
NICE
unfuckingbelievable!!!!!!
Refs giving us a PI to make up for a bad call
Oh man. Chase took a dive there
Makeup call
WHAT THE FUCK???
Makeup for us lol
HAHAH SUCK IT TEXANS
WHAT THE FUCK
Thanks refs. I guess you did something
"The ""what did I do??"" Stance with your hands up make him for sure guilty"
FUCK SCOBEE!!
"I mean, I’ll take it I guess"
And the emmy goes to!
Makeup call
THAT IS THE WORST PASS LMAO
Ayyy lol
Damn we got lucky
Another drop
dude
Fuck
Pass has got to be there
FG then
gotta catch that man
Omg
Terrible choice
The fuck
i’m getting pissed
Defense....step up
She needs to work on her warrior stance
"Let's go D,  can't let us down now"
GOD DAMNIT
That penalty was costly
great stop
Good return
We gotta get a TD now
Ray Ray 🐐
Let’s give Ray Ray a screen pass or sweep!
Jesus
Never stood a chance there
We just setting up the punt
Need to get McFarland involved in some screens.
But why
Ahhh that sucks
If we somehow won this game I really won't feel like we deserved it.
SWITZER
We need to capitalize on this field position
Tuitt!
The only thing that is keeping us in the game is that Houston think they can run it
There Tuitt is!
Scared. Kicked it out of bounds
"Texans fan here, Do you guys think that every time we have a first down we are going to run the ball as well?"
I would decline every on purpose delay of game just to be a dick
Fox McCloud reporting.
This drive: 2 yard run -> 1 yard run -> 6 yard pass -> punt
WTF was that spot?
Better half time adjustments on the D side
"Alright, take advantage"
Punting is not on the menu for either team today
Jesus fuck man
How about a run
Garbage offense man
"""Nobody bit on that run.""

No shit."
We had the ball for about 7 seconds there
Football Team and Eagles need to step up. Wtf?!
Great
Omg we cant even get a field goal here
"Heart fucking breaking. 

God damn it."
Block in the back?
Wow...just wow.
WOOOOOW
smh
This game is disappointing 😞
Bince is our best db
How about cover the middle
YAY TJ
"Are you fucking kidding me? 

We're gonna lose this shit at this rate."
Football with no fans reminds me of baseball. There’s an intensity that’s missing. I think that works against the Steelers Defense.
Nice
Is BINCE our best coverage player?
Zone. Zone. Zone.
He got stamped
Watt got fucked up
LETS FUCKING GOOO FINALLLLYLY
"Alright offense, get it going"
"4-5 yard short first down pass instead of a run?  Well... yeah, that is pretty likely good play calling.  Now lets NOT run it 2 times in a row and punt."
Great catch Ebron!
Heaaaaaaaaath
I'd like to see a breakdown of us throwing to the flats and it doing anything.
Huge.
"Conner said ""get up off me"""
Ebron just killed the Texans that's like the 3rd bullet on his resume
Conner hurt again...
Finally looking like we have a rhythm on offense
Texans #41 let his tm struggle then let Connor get the first down lmao
"WTF kind of bullshit tackle from 41.

Trying to hurt Conner"
Trick play time
"FUCK, please stop overthrowing"
Mac Attack
Ben's bionic elbow
"6+ over thrown long passes. Ben, dial it back by 2."
I wanna see more MacFarland. Every other run he got ten yards
Vance and Ebron both on fire today
Need to get Ben some 11ft receivers
Let’s go Vance!
Vance is a truck
JC LFG
Wèèeeeeeeeeee
finally
2!
"Yes! Nicely done!

Here we go D, here we go!"
"That was an outstanding drive.  Credit to Fichtner, that was a perfect balance of running and passing, and a good adjustment to running without our FB."
Defense! Defense! Defense!
TJ is a fucking demon. I’d run through walls for this kid
LETS GO TJ
"Every time they say something good about watson, he gets rekt. Lol"
DPOY
3rd and 26 gotta hold them here
Texans are now playing 4th quarter Steelers. Game over.
Third and 25 scares me.
"Alright, now we run."
"Took a little bit, but we seem to be firing on all cylinders. Love to see it."
HERE WE GOOOO
I wish I could wear gold aviators...
Great stop by the defense. Need the run game to finish this one off.
That is how you run block!!
Alright JC!
Need the 4 minute offense
I hope we don’t play super conservative on this drive
Texans out of gas
Just stay in bounds fuck man
Cannot stop the run in the 4th quarter or just cannot stop James fucking Conner?
It’s almost as if preseason isn’t good for us
2 YARDS BOYS
Vance McDonald is ragdolling motherfucker
Texans melting
That’s a longggggg FG
"Run, run, run..."
Stay in bounds!
Damn... they blew up that run blocking there.  Time for a long field goal
Go for it please
Hell yes
LOVE TO SEE IT
LET'S GO BOYS!!!!!
Niiiiiiice
Let’s go!!!!
NICE
Great play call there for once!
I love u Ben 😍😍
I want a touchdown nothing elsse
Ball security.
Come on steel dickers lets get that TOUCHDOWN to put the dagger in em
Need Benny to save me in fantasy
Matt Feiler was amazing today.
Pass here
We need Boz on this one!
"What happened to the eagles?


I thought they were going to e good again for awhile with wentz"
Claypool
Caught them napping there!
We just need three here.
"Texans really just wasted their last timeout? Bosgod about to knock another 3 onto the board.

Bold move Cotton."
Finally a call went our way
WHEEEEEWWW
oh shit that was close to a major fuck up
That was terrifying
GET A TD FK EM
wheewwwwwwwwwww
HOLY SHIT!!!
Yoooooooooo
I think the clock is broken
How is it first and goal and still ticking?
"Congrats, Raven. You easily win the division. We suck complete balls."
Fuck it. We are way too overrated. Average at best
Yeah this is headed south fast. Texans are about to put up 40.
This defense is garbage without Watt
Y'all killing the secondary. There is no pass rush. How long do you think they can cover receivers for realistically?
I'd have preferred our first TO to be a bigger deal than just a pass punt.
time for the offense to do absolutely nothing with the turnover
Pussy shit not going for that.
Ben looks terrible rn
Our defense isn’t even good lol
leave it to the steelers to make a 0-2 team look good. Disgusting.
[deleted]
Will we have more points or 3 and outs in this game?
Conner looks SO slow.
"Ok so early draft list: OL, RB, CB"
Cut every single DB that isn't named Haden or Fitzpatrick. Cut them yesterday.
I just gotta laugh at all these dumbfounded Steelers fans. Player X regressed so much! No. They just aren’t playing Ryan Finley. The secondary was never very good. They got torched by Brady and Wilson. How quickly we forget that
WE SUCK DICK AT 3RD AND SHORT OMG THIS IS GARBAGE WHY NOT SNELL
I feel like he could have dived for that
Go for it
"This game is going to come down to the defense. I wouldn't have been worried in the past, but we haven't been looking good today."
Has our offense ever not gone 3 and out first possession 😂
Ben should have run there. huge hole and only 3 yard for the first
"Well, shit."
Defense has been looking like Swiss cheese since the second half last week
"Where are all those yinzers that bitch about ""not running old school behind Watt""?"
Ah yes fair catch on the 4
Nothing worse than getting kicked in the dick
Does it look like Ben is walking around with a limp to anyone else?
Why waste a timeout what
"Who the fuck was that to? A guy who was double covered, Jesus fuck"
Who are you passing to Ben?
This is a bit on DJ for that silly fair catch
TOLD YA. 41 got destroyed by Vance. Is leaving.
the secondary was a strength last year
Nelson and Minkah just giving up pass after pass
Nice work ladies!
"All things considered the defense isn't playing poorly, they're getting no time to rest and still making Watson work for it a little. Offense is hitting the snooze button hard."
why is mcfarland in?? conner has looked fine so far
..are we really not gonna get a td from the 1?
SNELL! SNELL! MACH SNELL!
"oh my god we're so fucking awful
sike LOL"
Need for the pass rush to get there. The zone won't hold if Watson has a pocket and time.
"Watson just throw the ball man, you don't gotta get hit like that."
JC from shotgun haters where?
Best Watt is injured :(
Nice drive! But they shouldn’t have went out of bounds so much
Hello haters (aka mark madden)
I think everyone thought this game was going to be a cake walk and forgot that houston is actually a good team.
Hot Take: McCloud as PR; McFarland as Rb1; Claypool moves up with DJ out
because fuck facemask penalties am i right? classic refball
"Washington should’ve laid out for that, Ben snorted cocaine before the game I think, he’s pumped"
Fuck fuck fuck
Oh shit that 3rd and goal I thought was 4th down for some reason
RIP Ben
Second time this season our receivers ran a route short of the sticks
Garbage punt
It’s so clear that people here really have strong opinions on the play calling but don’t understand the dynamic. Ben took a huge shot and the best thing to do is hand it off and hope for a good chunk of yards to make the 3rd down play manageable and let Ben get his bearings.
I wanna stop running but *our receivers can't stop dropping*
Gotta catch one handed ig
Why would they keep running??
Is cobb invisible or some shit
Every receiver is wide open!
Garbage secondary
We can’t stop the pass game. Butler went all in on stuffing the run and sucking the QB at the expense of our pass coverage.
It feels like we’re blowing them out but it’s only a 7 point game
Conner great run but fall on bounds
STOP RUNNING FROM THE SHOTGUN ON THIRD DOWN HOLY FUCK
Who is willing to bet the Steelers don’t try at all? I’m betting a Ben Knee.
Its so funny seeing the coach apologists in this thread. Our entire coaching staff is NCAA Div II tier.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Wonder when people are going to start giving Ben shit on these drops for throwing bad passes
[deleted]
Eh I don’t know if that was dpi. Looked like his arm got tangled when the defender was trying to pick it off.
Fuck diontae
"I know that was one of his *better* punts, but Colquitt fucking BLOWS"
Maybe we can get just blown out and our hearts won’t explode
Oh look more idiots blaming Minkah for Steven Nelson’s fuck ups.
"Potentially stupid question here: what if JuJu had purposely stepped out of bounds (as opposed to walking it in for a touchdown), hoping to really burn some clock and setting the Steelers up for 3 tries right at the goalline?  Would that have been a respectable strategy, given how much time was left and given that the Texans had all of their timeouts, or should you always take the points in that situation?"
Snell would’ve caught that ball
[deleted]
well..we're pretenders. We've been exposed. 😊
This game is done. Our secondary is straight fucking garbage
Now I see why Seattle didn’t care about losing Ebron
Mike Hilton is so fucking bad in coverage.
[deleted]
This offense is fucking pathetic. Doesn’t matter who the QB is.
"I'd say I'm shocked by the play today but that would be a lie.. typical Tomlin trap game against an inferior opponent.. nice to see ""The standard is still the standard"""
"Guys, Watson is playing out of his mind. Sometimes the other team earns it"
"So I’ve missed most of the game until now, have they been playing well??"
Who the hell is Travis Scott?
I do not like Slim Ben
As a ravens fan; I am absolutely livid the Texans def is this trash. Might actually be 3-0. Pff  fake
NFL corrupt as ever as holding is ignored as per usual.
"It’s funny how we always hold Tomlin accountable for when we win, but when we’re losing and getting our asses kicker, everyone looks the other way lmao"
Here comes some terrible Tomlin time management
[deleted]
"People need to stop blaming receivers when Ben has been inaccurate this whole game. Good news is Ben is a hall of famer so I think he can fix it, but those misses by Conner and Washington wouldn’t have happened if Ben threw better balls.

Edit: yinz can downvote all you want but Ben has not played a good game. Nit-pick on a couple throws all you want but we need Ben to play better, plain and simple."
"I’ve been saying it for 10 minutes, this game is over."
[deleted]
It’s pretty embarrassing to be wearing Steelers garb at the bar surrounded by neutrals watching the Steelers get molested.
Three more yards than Conner would have got
Fuck this game. About to turn it off. Make some fucking adjustments Butler
This entire coaching staff has to go. Tomlin and Butler first.
[deleted]
So at what point do we hold Tomlin accountable? I mean we haven’t won a super bowl in over a decade with fucking Big Ben and haven’t been to one in almost a decade. We constantly underperform
Is it too late to get our first round pick back lmao fitz sucks this season
"How about we stop blaming drops and start blaming the QB for throwing behind receivers. 

Ben missed Ebron running wide open on the phantom defensive PI. Ben is playing fucking hero ball out there. He’s not even coming close to completing these passes"
Oof Vince baby what is you doin
Oh no.
"Fit Ben wouldn't need to CGI the ball, he could throw it over them mountains there if wanted."
Epic Steeler TD incoming...
Who is hurt
Who is hurt
That fair catch was full special ed mode
my fucking gawd
"Dude, Ben what are you doin. Tryin for a flag?"
What a fucking shit show so far. Defense can’t cover. Offense can’t move the ball.
[deleted]
We need to have a talk with our secondary. Why is Minkah waiting i know he can read the QB much better than this. Be close before hand. Don't wait till they catch it to tackle
No time to panic...Big Ben will get us there.
"What I’m seeing is our defense keeps getting put in really tough spots. Need more out of Watt right now rushing against the moving turnstile Titus Howard.

One pressure so far and it wasn’t a good one as he allowed Deshaun to get outside the pocket."
Drop drop drop miss pass miss pass...
That’s what happens when you put a fucking fourth string running back in there.
VMC caught it!!
78 is just not that good anymore
GODDAMNIT
like just run to the outside.... its not that hard...
I love Ben
I'm feelin a Minkah play
"When we finally have a chance to go out and take the lead we do run, run, pass."
JUJU
We might need a DTD in this game
Smh
"I think our run defense maybe got even better. I don't even think our pass defense was much better last season. 


Teams did this last season too."
AFC North> NFC East
"Just trade Snell, lmao."
Lol can't get 1 freakin yard
Pathetic blocking on 3rd and short
His knee looked down no
Who gave Mike a ref flag?
Houston hasn't settled for any field goals while we've had to kick two. Smh
If Johnson ran up he would’ve gotten it lol
Go for it
We gonna try another 4th and short?
Man imagine having a decent kicker. We will probably never know that feeling.
What a crap punt
BRING BACK TODD HALEY
Pierre did a great job trying to sell that hold
How many times are we going to run that play with claypool across the formation and hand off to the back going the other way? I feel like we run it every drive.
Catch the fucking ball
ITS NEVER BENS FAULT!
Every school year is like no other CBS News.  God I hate that sensationalism.
Edmunds making an error in coverage what a surprise
Where can I stream this game??
Okay Randy don't be a fucking punk on play calls.
Bruhhhhh
Uhhh I think that’s a touchback right because he fumbled through the end zone?
Why did they make Jake from State Farm black? I’ve never met a black Jake in my life. Did the original white Jake offend people?
Conner is soft as baby shit
SON OF A BITCH CLAYPOOL
[deleted]
Minkah exposed again
BEAUTIFULLLL
There offense is in love with the pass when the run game is working
Good playcalling coach
"Seeing us pass this much with old ass Ben (he’s still solid, but definitely lost a few steps) in this close of a game with Conner having 10 carries for solid yardage just makes me miss Todd Haley more and more. 

I’m sure I’ll get downvoted but there’s a reason Ben’s interceptions and sacks have skyrocketed since we ditched Haley"
[deleted]
[deleted]
Name a less dynamic running back than JC. Lmao just gets out in space and wastes it
CATCH THE MOTHERFUCKIN BALL BITCH.
Is it time to panic on the offense? It’s not like it’s been even good these first 3 weeks and it looks like wet shit today.
I fucking knew it was a mistake to keep going out of bounds every play. Tomlins time management skills on display
"and this will be a tie game at halftime

edit: I wish it was only tied"
The only time James Washington was actually good was with Ducky Hodges
[deleted]
[deleted]
Bad drop...horrible player. He needs replaced and cut ASAP
I think it's time we put Justin Layne in. Nelson just isn't the guy be fooled us to believe he was
James Conner still isn't that good.
"DoNT WoRry GuYs, wE aRe GoINg tO bE FiNe"
"He gave up on that play before the ball arrived, expecting a flag."
This game is over. Our defense can’t stop them. Our offense can’t move the ball.

"Obama and Dan Rooney were personal friends.  I do believe he was ultimately a Chicago sports fan but he’d root for Pittsburgh in general, at least I remember him doing so multiple times throughout his Presidency.

Trump I’ve never heard say a word about the Steelers prior to his recent rally."

&#x200B;

Excuse me, WTF?"
Snoop Dogg!
No they just hold up the jersey of the team that won the SB. Obama is a Bears fan and Trump is a Patriots fan
"Well Obama appointed Dan Rooney ambassador to Ireland, and Rooney thanked Obama on the podium after XLIII, so Obama might have at least some affinity for the Steelers."
Obama is a notorious Chicago bears fan. He’s holding this for the Steelers win of super bowl 43
"Pretty sure Obama is a Bears fan (I also love the Bears). Still tho, it’d be really cool if he was a fan of my favorite football team and baseball team."
Chipper Jones is surprising
But what about Wiz Khalifa?  I knew he was a fake fan /s
"A better question is who gives a shit lmao it’s the president, they’ll hold up any team jersey of the city they’re in or praise any team that wins the Super Bowl. It’s all a PR move because dumb people seem to put stock in “omg this candidate/celebrity held up my teams jersey!!! Der, I’m gonna vote for/support them because they like my team!” No, they don’t. They just know the dumb people will buy into that type of cheap disingenuous bullshit."
Obama spoke at pitt when he was running for president. Had franco harris introduce him. Claimed he was a fan of the Steelers while watching the immaculate interception while living in Hawaii. I don't believe those time lines don't add up.
"I'm actually Obama and yes, I like the Steelers. Don't @ me"
Trump is friends with Big Ben.  They may even be eskimo brothers.

How about that second half defense?
We need 2019 Steven Nelson. 2020 Steven Nelson isn’t very good.
JUST HAVE A LITTLE FAITH ARTHUR!
"Did they score at all in the 2nd half?  

These knee jerk fan reactions drive me insane."
I feel like we're not respecting their o-line/worried about Watson running so we're not sending the blitz but all that's doing is giving Watson time in the pocket to pick us apart
Hey we got the W
You could so easily make this for the Texans' secondary on that JuJu TD
There was still a little meat left on the bone is all
"We're blitzing like crazy this year, any secondary is going to get beat up a little with this kind if philosophy."
Maybe let's try a whole secondary of Zac Effron clones....you don't know for sure it would be worse!
Get’cha head in the game
"Good news, the Steelers defense got their act together in the second half. Here are some DeShaun Watson stats to prove it.

First Half: 14/18 202 yards 2TD

Second Half: 5/9 62 yards Int

Also, the Texans running game could never get going."
The D really stepped up in 2nd half though..
"wasn't really secondary's fault, watson was getting a lot of time to throw in the first half because refs missed a lot of holding calls on TJ"
"Some were bad, some were absolute dimes from Watson."
The standard is the standard...
True
""
"Players ruled out for the rest of their games already include: Steelers WR Diontae Johnson (concussion), Falcons WR Russell Gage (concussion), 49ers TE Jordan Reed (ankle/knee) and Eagles TE Dallas Goedert (knee).

"I disagree, this call is integral to the rules of the game and removing it would change the way its played."
"The penalties usually have no bearing on the play because they're usually unintentional.

The rule itself has a massive impact on the game.

The 12 men rule is exactly the same. Are you suggesting they remove the penalty for having an extra player on the field...?"

"He only has one pick in three games. If anything, I feel like his decision making has been BETTER downfield."
This is his fourth game in 2 calendar years. He's getting back into it.
Ben is playing pretty well imo.
"Nah, Ben's throwing a lot less flutter balls, if any, this year like he did a lot of the last few years.  The surgery seemed to have fixed him."

I misread the title... I thought you named your kid Renegade.
Awesome! I have that exact same blanket!
Congrats on the baby! And thanks for making a new Steeler fan.
Congrats
"And on a win 💪🏼 couldn’t be better, congrats"
"Nice!

Welcome to THE NATION!"
You baby is gorgeous!!! Congrats!
Great taste...Go Steelers
Congrats Steelers bro

I’ve always wondered ...how is that as a grill flipper? It’s always caught my eye but I never pulled the trigger on it...
""
Last time we went 4-0 was 1979 when we actually won that Superbowl. Inject it into my veins!!!
Be fun to beat Arrogant Rodgers in this year’s SB.
It's not over yet
There's only one champ.  That season was a failure.  Let's hope this one goes better.
"Our offensive play calls were just amazing this game! The fourth down conversions were smart and well executed, and the runs to end the game were also super solid.  He gets a lot of hate here but commendable play calls on offense caused this win."
"Agreed... 

I remember my Dad moaning in disgust a few years ago with we’d go on 4th. Looked tight, especially fake to Claypool..."
"His play calling early was trash. I say this as one of the biggest defenders of him.

It got better as it went on.

The team just... They really really struggle to start games well. They need to figure out a way to come out and play with confidence and composure."
Idk about the deep ball on 4th and short lol
Pretty sure the OCs switched sides at halftime
"It's back thanks to multiple requests and positive feedback. Here are my real-time thoughts:

- Glad they're letting Conner run outside. He is much better in space than running between the tackles.

- Wondering if Ben audibled into the hand-off to Samuels. Seems weird to run the ball with him. If they're gonna run there why not let McFadden take it? 

- Unusual to see Mike Hilton get beat like he did on the Texans first quarter touchdown.

- Ben throwing deep on 3rd and 7 from inside his 20 will never not be infuriating. 

- Starting to wonder if Stephon Tuitt is ever going to be as good as was prior to getting hurt last year. He has been invisible this season. Which isnt unusual for him prior to the 2019 season.

- Steelers down 14-3 in the 2nd quarter and the defense still hasnt given up a touchdown on a drive that wasnt extended by a 3rd down penalty or on a short field.

- So far this has the feel of one of those games that the offense loses but everyone blames on the defense.

- Ben with a nice block on the reverse to Diontae but he should never do that again.

- When the broadcast returned from commercial at the two minute warning they showed a crude photoshop of Ian Eagle's face on someone else's head and that's when I realized how much Ian Eagle looks like Subway Spokespedo Jared Fogle.

- Great two minute drive for the offense. 

- Texans' two minute touchdown drive was the first time Steelers allowed a touchdown without a short field or penalty extending the drive.

- This is a good challenge by Tomlin. Ball crossed by half a yard before being OOB. If they dont overturn this it's a travesty.

- That's a travesty. His knee is down and the ball is over the line needed. Garbage call.

- I am so fucking sick of going deep on 3rd and 4th and short. They got bailed out by the PI but fucking stop.

- Too many drops today. Somewhere Hillibilly is blaming Tomlin for not preparing the receivers' hands properly.

- Concerning they could only get 3 on the opening drive of the 2nd half because it feels like the defense hasnt really stopped Houston outside of the first drive of the game.

- I started ripping Stephon Tuitt to my dad and he almost sacked Watson. Maybe I need to keep it up.

- I also hate running the ball on 2nd on 19. 

- I'd go for it here.

- Missed pass interference when Roby grabbed Claypool's arm. I wouldve assumed it was obvious when you see a guy only using one arm to try to catch a ball but what do I know?

- What will it take for TJ Watt to draw a holding call? He is held on like every play and it's never called.

- What a change in the defense in the 2nd half. 

- I still have yet to be impressed with Dustin Colquitt but I'm sure hes probably better than Berry.

- 3-0 feels good. Bring on the Tits!"
Love the Hillbilly callout
McFadden back on the team? Jk. Great write up
"I feel like they have to let Samuels run the ball sometimes just so the other team doesn't clue in that it's a pass play every time he's in the play.

""So far this has the feel of one of those games that the offense loses but everyone blames on the defense."" - guarantee that would have happened if the offense didn't score at the end even with a second half shutout. 

TJ Watt's lack of holding calls reminds me very much of prime Deebo."
"I'm a big Ebron critic, but really liked his game today. He looked solid"
How did we not get that call overturned for Ben’s scramble for the 1st down? The whole booth and Mike Pereria all seemed to be in agreement? What happened there?
Did the defense change anything schematically in the second half or was it just better execution? And thank you for these write ups.
">Ben with a nice block on the reverse to Diontae but he should never do that again.

The commentators called this one well, paraphrased, ""That was a great block, but the fans are going to hate that he's doing it""."
">What will it take for TJ Watt to draw a holding call? He is held on like every play and it's never called.

This seems to be a trend across the NFL, nobody is getting called for holding unless it's completely egregious. Probably intended to help protect QBs. Personally I'm a big fan of this change, I hate seeing drives get killed over questionable holds

Edit: holding calls were down 78% in week 1 compared to 2019"
"> Bring on the Tits!

Okay ladies you know what to do! Send them to Sleestak's inbox! lol

Great game by the Steelers that second half reminded me of the Super Bowl years."
Where was the comment when Tuitt finally appeared and got the sack?
"What the fuck is up with the lack of holding calls in general? Did the refs just unanimously decide to say fuck it, that's not a rule anymore?"
I'm very glad you're doing these even if they haven't gained traction again yet. You've still got your fans

0 POINTS IN THE SECOND HALF
Offense stopped living in their fears at the end. Defense pitched a second half shutout. No turnovers for the first time in like 10 years. Can’t be 19-0 without being 3-0. Here we fucking go.
"Hi there Steelers fans. I'm just a Texans fan here to thank you for your contribution to the fire BoB fund, we are now one step closer to firing the fraud of a coach. Kinda wish you guys had scored 40 on us though."
"""Bill O'Brian is 37-3 when taking a lead into halftime.""

*Tomlin lowers sunglasses*

""37-4"""
Thank god we held on to 3-0
Okorafor had a strong game
"Man it was like mass suicide in here in the second quarter.  Fire Tomlin, Minkah was a mistake, Fichtner sucks, blah blah blah - Jesus Christ!  Second half shutout, held them to 21.  Here we fucking go!!!"
Everybody get in here!
"Shoutout to Vance McDonald today, was hustling and getting great blocks to open up the run game."
2 Watts are better than 1
"JJ Watt - 1 tackle
TJ Watt - 4 tackles, 1 sack"
"Steelers had the ball for 11:50 of the game's final 13:27

D gave up ZERO second half points"
"In years previous, I definitely feel like this is a game we would have lost. Slow start on offense, defense playing like garbage in the first half, playing down to an opponent, etc. 


But we came out in the second half and did a great job. This really seems like a different Steelers team. 


Obviously, we have a lot more work to do with getting better in the secondary with coverage, and our offense definitely needs to get better too whether it's on playcalling or just executing plays properly. 

Also, proud of Conner. Not the biggest fan of him, but two back to back games in a row he does a great job of running."
2nd half adjustments? MORE OF THAT PLEASE
"Now that that’s done, can we agree to quit commenting “we suck” and “games over” in the first quarter of the game thread?"
WE BROKE THE TURNOVER STREAK!
"That's 3-0 ladies and gentlemen. 



Never, ever, EVER doubt Large Benjamin"
"Juju impressed me with his blocking today. It doesn't get the attention it deserves for the value it brings. And if I notice it, it has to be good.

He gets ragged on a bit for being a showy guy off the field but he gets dirty on it and thats what counts."
Mapletron is gonna be good.
"Damn it feels good to be 3-0. Holy run game in the second half, Batman!"
We’re going to the superbowl
What was up with the clock? It didn’t stop at 2 minutes.
"Had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
"Now THATS a tale of two halves. Fucking hell, let’s talk about it:

Bad:

- Jaylen Samuels/McFarland as third down back. Just wtf was that? Conner or Snell, preferably Snell, take third down responsibilities. Can’t create such a big mismatch and this was the thing that really stuck out to me and had me bothered. 

- Diontae PR. This dude scares the fuck out of me. He’s dynamic WITH the ball, but calling a fair catch on the 4? Man oh man. Hopefully his noggin is good because he’s a stud but man we cannot lose positioning on ST’s. 

- Pass pro. I have said it every week, Ben cannot take these hits. Not real pleased with Al/Feiler. I know OL tape is hard from a tv view but man they didn’t look sharp. Gonna need a watch through on the a22 but not too thrilled. 

- Third down conversions. We can all agree this area needs to improve right? I don’t have the numbers but Jesus they didn’t feel good. Gotta clean this up. 

Good:

- Vince. This dude came to play and just routinely shows why he won’t lose his job. Such a solid player. Not a fan on him covering fuller but really solid from him. 

- we finally used ebron as we should: a big body receiver. Glad he had his coming out party

- McFarland... looks to be as advertised man. He is fast and a real good debut for the rook, consider me a fan. 

- Chuks. I said it above but OL tape is hard from a tv view but I am really impressed with Chuks. I know we had a very small sample size from banner and Chuks but Chuks has looked really solid out there. JJ was a non factor and our third round guy played a solid game. 

- Ray ray.... he gonna break one one day. We finally have a dynamic guy on KR’s. Consider me a fan man. 

Overall, was it the prettiest? No. Do I give a fuck? Absolutely not. We’re 3-0 and we rebounded hard in the second half. Shoutout to the coaching staff for the adjustments made because they were huge. Let’s get ready for Tennessee boys. One last question.... WHO RIDE!?!?"
"First and foremost, bless the knees, arms, ankles, kankles and keep em healthy! 


I mentioned it last week, but this game was definitely the prove it game for us. 


Lemme start with the negatives:

That first quarter was abysmal on both sides of the ball for us. Pretty typical these last couple games unfortunately, but that’s stiller football lmao. 


Dionte is a wildcard at punt returner man. That fair catch at the 4 yard was fuckin dumb. The guy has a bunch of questionable decision-making. He’s good but he just has to sharpen up his decisions.


Our secondary... man they are practically invisible at best, and a liability at worst. Minkah has been stagnant, last season he was quiet because he shut shut down, now he’s quiet but there’s nothing dynamic out of him. Still early, but there needs to be a change!Besides Hilton, who’s carrying us in that area, bless the man! 


Big Ben is throwing it more, but his accuracy is very questionable this game. Overthrowing out the ass. Glad they’re letting him let loose, so hopefully it’s still the rust that will be gone in a game or two, pref


Run,run,pass... fuck outta here with that my guy. 


Positives:

That pick in the fourth was a game changer!!! Hilton is a goddamn dog!! Fucking love what he’s been doing so far. Such an underrated player, who’s finally making himself known to the general public.


TJ WATT THE TRUTH, DONT NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE


Ben, Juju/Ebron connection is getting there! Ebron with a fantastic catch td! 


Offense is at that good connection so far. Not up to what I would consider awesome but you can tell they got it together at the second half, especially 4th quarter. 


*Lemme add, we turned things completely around the second half! D didn’t let up any points! Gotta give props to the secondary, who still got me a bit nervous, but nonetheless.

So overall, we’ve proven ourselves to be good imo. Texans are not a bad team at all. They had us for the majority and then we went beast mode at the second half. Sure, they were 0-2 coming in, but they faced the 2 best teams consecutively and then us.  


TITANS NEXT.... HERE WE GO"
First in the AFC NORTH BITCHES!! Also the Watt brothers are discussing getting Subway after the game
2 Watt > 1 Watt confirmed
"Loved this game.  I was kinda expecting a letdown.  The D looked shakey in the first half.

D shut out the second half.  Ben and Conner both looked good.

Big team win."
[deleted]
Our death was greatly exaggerated
Anyone else watching this bonkers rams/bills game?
"PROS:  

* TJ Watt.
* We held Watson to 5 rushing yards. If we want to win the division, that means beating the Ravens and being able to shut down mobile quarterbacks. We did that today, in spades.
* Vince Williams, and TJ Watt.
* We saw the emergence of the running game with every back getting carries. Its good to see variety and plan coming forward.
* Tuitt is back! alongside TJ Watt.
* We have two TEs! Or just way too many oversized wide receivers. Ebron showed up today, and Vance had some classic Vance. Also, Juju playing like a TE at times too with crazy yards after contact. 
* We have the best Watt.

CONS:

* Week two of Steelers vs Refs + Team. Sometimes you have to play harder to win, but this is getting old fast. Apparently holding on the offense isn't a penalty anymore.
* Deep ball was really bad today. Ben was overthrowing everyone, and we got really lucky on that 4th down DPI call. 
* Secondary is starting slow in games, and while we might be able to catch up now that we actually have an offense to bring to the field, the better QBs are going to take advantage early and quickly. Playing from behind all game is not the situation we want to see ourselves in.

All in all, a great game for the Steelers. Tomlin seems to have a long game plan so we can't expect every possession to be a big one, but if we give up points while not generating enough movement on the offense it's going to be a tough road uphill in a lot of games."
[removed]
Juju deserves way more love than he gets here.
It feels so good to have Ben back again
"3 & 0!


3 & 0!


3 & 0!"
Can't wait to hear this weeks episode of Pittsburgh Dad
Ben must feel like a kid in a candy store with all of the receiving options he has now. Good thing we do not have a diva receiver demanding the ball on every play any longer.
"Two Watts are better than one, so you're always invited to join JJ."
Good feeling winning in the 4th quarter instead of blowing a lead. 3-0. nice!
How many sacks is that now?
The amount of sacks this defense is generating is almost video game status
That was a football game.
We ride at dawn bitches 3-0 let’s goooo!!!
VICTORY SCREECH! LOLOLOLOOOLOLOLOL
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT!!!!! 3-0 BABY? Now do I buy a Juju jersey or a Claypool jersey. I have funds for one
All you tomlin haters better eat crow. We had amazing adjustments on both sides.
"whew. was ugly in the 1st half, but we fixed most of our shit and played a great game towards the end. being 3-0 feels so good"
Whatever second half adjustments were made worked like a fucking charm
I thought Watt was going to get a late hit call on the interception.
"""Ben is too old and the secondary is hot trash and the Texans are going to score 40 points!"" --Fans who never watched a Steelers or other NFL game before"
I was depressed half the game until we won
"Cleaned it up in the second half.


Good win for our guys. I think the Texans were a good (not great) team.


Games get real for here on out. Here we gooooooo"
This team really impressed coming out of the half. That touchdown at the end of the second quarter was the last time their offense had any time to breathe. Total shutdown in the second half. Running game was super on point but it felt like a lot more outside runs (maybe we should stop running it inside constantly hmmmm) so the guys had more room to work with. Really loving this team right now
Completely different team in the 2nd half. Great stuff
Mike Hilton
"UNDEFEATED:

Game ball to TJ Watt and the guy that did a fantastic job against the other Watt, CHUKWUMA OKARAFOR. Love Banner but looks like we have an absolute beast at right tackle. Shoutout to our scouting and our O line coach Sharret for continuing to draft and develop  that unit.

WHO RIDE......WE RIDE"
"They had us in the first half, not gonna lie"
"Okorafor was a total baller today, I am so impressed. Good team win, way to adjust. And no turnovers!!!"
"I too, am moist."
How bout some love for Juju doing a back flip for that 1st down!
"Honestly, I feel JuJu might be a priority re-sign just for locker room culture."
"Game threads are fuuuucking toxic. We're not going to absolutely smother every team every week on defense. Pitched a shutout in the 2nd half and the offense powered up, punted when necessary and won the game. Great win."
What a game man. Defense shut it down in the second half.
"3-0!

# LETS FUCKING GOOOOO!!!!"
"I’m so happy. 

HERE WE GO."
good game boys. now we can relax and watch the rest of the games tonight
A pretty good all around game from everyone today
"Defense was great in the second half. 

Good win"
3-0.
Kind of telling that we never started 3-0 with both Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown.
I like wins. I like our Watts. I like our defense. I like our healthy ben. A lot to like. Bring on the titans.
LETS GOOOOO
I was super worried this entire game but the defense really shut down Watson in the second half. Holy hell that was scary.
"First half started out messy but we dominated the second. 

 I’m feeling good about this season. With Ben back and finally an elite defense again I feel confident we can make a run deep.

Steelers play their worst football in September usually. Now we are starting out 3-0 and we haven’t even had our gimme games of the bengals and to a lesser extent browns.

Excited. When was the last time we started 3-0?"
Second 1/2 D was suffocating. Last time we were 3-0 we were AFC Champions.
"Copy and pasting my thoughts that I posted in the GT -

Said this when it was 14-3: 

The only thing l'm going to say is good teams battle back from bad starts. They make adjustments and improve over the course of a game. The next 2 hours will determine if we are a good team. hope the answer is yes. Because so far it hasn't been

........

I think we can say we are a good team now."
Might actually watch Ravens vs. Cheifs tommorow.
"I’m from the Erie area. When’s the last time the Steelers, Browns, and Bills all won in the same weekend? Or even how many times has that happened in the past twenty years? I was trying to find that stat but it seems to be a tough to get to."
A win is a win
"The Run game and second half defense won this game. Great games from Conner and McFarland. 

Mediocre game from Ben. At least he didn’t turn the ball over"
"Excellent win and exciting game all around. 3-0 for first time since 2010?? Good shit. 

Defense really clamped down that second half. Very nice seeing the team able to make adjustments after a rough opening."
"A positive I want to mention is the job Chuks did with JJ today, really felt like he made him a non-factor"
"This, to me, is an enormous win precisely because it's the sort of game they would have found a way to lose in the Killer B years. The narrative was so familiar: offense starting sluggish, defense getting carved up by a good quarterback on a bad team, playing down to competition, yada yada yada. But not this year. Not this team. The offense did enough with some excellent plays from everyone, though nobody individually went off. The defense locked the door and melted the key for scrap metal in the second half. Stairway to Seven baby, here we go!!"
"I feel like our secondary is not as bad as people say it is. They're usually good at coverage, but when they do give up plays they're pretty big ones. Add in that Deshaun Watson is a really good QB, I'm not surprised. But Tannehill is coming next week and we better not play like the 1st half defense."
Finally broke the turnover streak by Steelers offense and special teams. 25 games.
"We're going to get games like that. Every team does. We can't expect to dominate every half. What's important is how we react. Watson is a quality QB who causes teams all kinds of problems and we kept him out of the game in the second half. No turnovers is a huge stat too. We really, REALLY need to start better though.

3 and fucken 0!"
Why’s ESPN only showing TJ with one sack? He should have 1.5 no? He got that one big solo one in the 4th but I swear he had another one where he helped Dupree bring down Watson?
Hate how we go down in the first half and all the “fans” on Twitter start roasting the team. There are two haves for a reason lol
"For a team whose run game produced quite well today, our fans sure to complain a lot in the game threads every time we run the ball."
Never doubted this team. Half of you continue to be dumbshits. The game is not over in the first quarter. Stay out of next weeks game thread.
"TJ and Derek to JJ : ""So mom and dad love us more now, just saying"""
Okofor looked great. Happy to see us our coach Bob and the Texans.
The defense really showed up in the 2nd half. Great game.
Chucky is a beast
DONT BLINK.
"Our offensive play calls were smart and well executed, gotta hand it to Fichtner here.  After a shaky start both the O and later the D started turning up the heat, and although the Texans are a solid team they just couldn’t keep up with it.  Week 4 against the Titans we need to get off to a hot start sooner, because we seem to have a habit of being slow first quarter.  Players wise I loved Conner this game, what a strong performance that shows he’s our RB1. Juju is just a fantastic blocker, and Ebron was setting up some great chemistry with Ben on important third downs"
"I shoulda known better than to start Waller over Ebron. He was eventually have a great game and he did today. Also great job by the defense in the second half, wish they were like that the first half but I’ll still take it"
Yoooo some of ya guys gotta chill. Saying the season is over when we are losing in the second quarter lol...
VICTORY PRE-ROLL!!
"what a fucking game. steeler football, and all the heart palpitations that come with it, is back baby!!"
Allowed 0 pts in the 22nd half to Deshaun Watson
"Damn first 3-0 since 2010?

I really didn't want to care about this season because I'm afraid Covid is going to cancel it but damn it I have hope now!"
"D line was good in the first half and great in the second, O line absolutely balled out in the second. Massive shoutout to Chuk, he kept JJ quiet all day, big performance from him. Conner proved he’s a starting calibre RB when healthy (just a shame it won’t be with us). Secondary still look shaky but hopefully it’s just a lack of preseason reps. Pretty much all our receivers had their moments as well, we’ve quietly built up a really strong corp there. Juju had better be coming into the room to sign his contract just as TJ leaves it. 

Excited for the Titans game now, we’ve proven these last three weeks that run stuffing is our bread and butter so hopefully we can take Henry out of the equation. 4-0 would be a hell of a start after last season"
Excellent ending. Defense and offense both looked like they figured it all out by the end. 3-0 feels good.
"We beat a great team and adjusts the fuck of them before 2 half. Great coaching and execution by everyone in second half. 3-0 babyyyyyyyy 
I’m absolutely ducking down something today


Edith: Someone"
Vance had his best game in like 2 years.
Some wacky games in the league today.
"Falcons bout to choke 2 weeks in a row

Edit: lol they did"
"I missed the game cause of work sadly, will rewatch tonight to see the W 🤙

Just need the Celtics to lose tonight and its the perfect day for me"
In TJ we trust
"After that game, I willing to cool off on Butler. I think my analysis on him comes down to this: The man is godawful at gameplanning, but god-tier at halftime adjustments. I would like to sharpen up our first half performance to be truly happy with Butler's scheming. 

Ben played well, CALL MORE MEDIUM CROSSING ROUTES. We don't need homerun passes until Ben trains a bit more.

Drops really killed us. Connor had a great day on the ground, I really wish he would make more plays on the ball and not drop passes."
What are these weird things we have? Are they...wins?
It's nice to have an offense again
"I wonder what happened at halftime that woke the Defense up? 

Also I didn't see the play where Dionte went out I really hope he's gonna be okay. Concussions suck"
TJ Watt is a fucking beast
"We're getting outstanding performances from these offensive linemen filling in.  

Great second half and very nice to see the offensive not take their foot off the gas.  Ben knew giving the ball back to a hot Watson was a risky move, so they just kept pushing forward.  

Despite that first half, the defense continues to impress.  You can't expect them to hold EVERYONE every week, but they clamped down when they needed to for the second week in a row."
"Overall solid game . We fought hard and came back and came out with a W  showing great character and grit from the whole team . I hope moving forward We can  get the run game going early on , and not only deep in the 4th. But hey 3-0 feels great. On to the next. Here we gooo!!"
Our 2pt conversion was surgical
LOLTEXANS
I hope the Dionte injury isn’t too bad 🥴
Will I watch a Steelers game this season without a clenched anus for 92% of the game?
"Since I dont see a NFL-At-Large thread:

Congrats go to Joey Burrow for getting above 0.000 

by tying the 3rd Worst team in the NFL who gave them several turnovers and 4 OT possessions."
Held the Texans to 29 rushing yards? That’s good D.
"I don't know what's going to happen with this season, but this is the first time the Steelers have started 3-0 in 10 years, and this has not happened in either of my kids' lifetime. And it's so awesome, because this is the first year my son (7 years old) is REALLY into watching the games with us."
"Credit to Tomlin and Butler for making adjustments at halftime, something I didn't think they'd make. DeShaun looked like he was going to drop 40 on us after the first half."
Who’s watching this absolutely hilarious Bengals game? I am rooting so hard for a tie
"People here we’re talking about the test being this week. Watson was a decent quarterback to play against, and definitely gave her a secondary a test. I think the real test is looming in week four. Ryan Tannehill by no means the greatest quarterback, but the Titans are pretty well-rounded team. Hopefully we can get our defense waking up early. Not as worried about the run game, even with Derrick Henry. We need to strike fast and hard."
James Conner was the best back today. Thought they actually platooned everyone well though.
"Some of my favorite comments in the gamethread within the first 10 in-game minutes today.

>This defense plays with no heart.

>We’re going to get absolutely blown out by an 0-2 team

>Fichtner needs to go NOW

>Ebron drops everything!

>Bad drop...horrible player. He needs replaced and cut ASAP”"
This is team just feels special. Defense locked up the second half and boy is great to have a Good QB again. Stairway to seven baby
"Defense really stepped up their game in the second half.  Glad to see the pass rush finally making some moves against Watson.  Secondary needs to the shake their rust off, but other than that defense looks stout.  Lets go get that ring."
It was definitely a tale of 2 halves!! Let’s keep improving boys!!
I'm not even excited about 3-0 in excited that we're actually WINNING! Offense is looking better every week. Defense is showing some holes primarily in the secondary and linebacker position that just needs some tuning. Overall Here We Go Steelers!
That td at the end of the 1st half was the best thing to happen to the defense. Seemed to have woken them up because they played lights out in the 2nd half.
Now introducing Eric Ebron and Anthony McFarland.  I'm happy with the production from those two when they were called upon.
One of the most important calls of the game was moving to the run after the half. Our running back committee is also surprisingly effective.
"It is so nice to not have something good happening right now, Steelers going 3-0 is gonna keep me sane"
Feeling good about this win. Fought through some adversity and didn’t get too comfortable with the lead. This feels like the type of game we would’ve lost in the past. 3-0 boys!
"Glad to see the win, but gotta play better than today if they wanna beat Tennessee next week"
"Secondary woes continue but I believe they will get their communication down. Don't know when. But they will. Nelson, Minkah, and Joe just need to create that cohesion again"
[Me currently ](https://imgur.com/gallery/dqNDRxH)
"First time being 3-0 since 2010.
Wowzer"
"Shoutout the defense for that 2nd half shutout....3-0 baby, let’s keep it going next week against Tennessee!"
How’d we look today? I had to attend a socially distant wedding and missed the whole game.
Any score predictions for vs Titans? I think it will be close but we will come out ahead
It's nice having an offense again. I was worried Ben wasn't the same anymore but he's still probably a top 10 QB in the NFL.
3-0!!!
Do u want Sam darnold?
I find it still tough to judge how good the Steelers really are.  Yes they are 3-0 but their opponents combined records are 0-9.  Next week we play a 3-0 team whose opponents combined record is 1-8 so a win here may not tell us much.  I’m waiting for a game when we play a playoff contender.
"Mike Hilton is a straight dog, guy is flying around out there. Also loved the distribution of backs through the game, we’re going to have the titans on their toes next week. 

Beating Deshaun Watson I feel was a big stepping stone for this team. Lessons from this game will stick with these guys down the road when it’s cold and the games start to matter more. Another big test next week verse the titans baby. Lets get that 4-0"
dope
"It's frustrating watching this team throughout 3 games because it's there, the peak of what this team can be is shown in glimpses. Yet, throughout games, players on both sides of the field just have massive mental lapses or just straight up disrespect their opponent and make dumb decisions. I don't know who to blame but occasionally, our defensive backs especially, just approach teams or plays with condescension and it bites them in the ass with big plays and TDs.

I don't know who the Steelers are or who they are going to be this season but we are 3-0 so yay, I guess?"
Those second half adjustments. Wow.
Well well well.... here we go! Doing work and getting the W! Let's go Steelers!
"We looked like a true winning team today. Defense locked up in the 2nd half, offense scored on legit drives, and coaching had the balls to go for it to put it away. Great win!"
BIG BEN IS BACK!!!
Not sure what to make of this team but fuck it wayyyy better to be 3-0 than the 0-3 last year
Pre-season I had this one as a loss;  I'm *delighted* to be wrong!
Next game is going to be goood!
So the nfl is just done with offensive holding? I wish I could have recorded the game because I could make a pretty sizeable montage of TJ getting bear hugged.
"I don’t wanna exaggerate, but this may be by far the greatest team ever assembled."
I am DYING for Ray Ray to break one.  It has been too damn long since we had a special teams TD
"I’m just going to say it...minkah sucks, first game he was basically asleep, second game completely full of missed tackles and horrific penalties and this game Justin more blown coverage and never being in the right place. Yep I said it..I certainly hope things turn around for the secondary is making me really concerned"
""
"*mopping sweat* easy win, never had a doubt"
"3-0, here we go"
""
"Hell yeah, our offense looked damn good today. Glad he is alright."
"We are stacked at WR, but when aren't we as of late? Glad he's ok"
Heal up quick! Electric to watch.
"I think his loss was really rough for us on offense.

Ben seems to LOVE DJ. I think his injury had Ben looking for a new security blanket and it hurt us when things broke down without him out there.

But on special teams it's going to be a big boost for us. Ray Ray is a return beast and it will keep DJ healthier."
DJ took a serious shot.  Glad he's OK.
"Fucked my fantasy matchup this week, but whatever, I´m really glad he´s all right."
""
"It makes even more sense this way with how they had a lead going into half, then got murdered second half."
"Imagine having to play the Chiefs, Ravens and Steelers for your first 3 games"
The ravens should be the purple person and the chiefs should be red.
Houston just seems to shut down in the 2H of all their games! Way to go Steelers!!!
"""Look at Watson keeping the play going and not defaulting to a run but throwing it downfield""
,12 seconds later,
""... To Mike Hilton, but still, way to extend the play!"""
"They really couldn't pay Hopkins and Watson at the same time. B.O.B. doesn't execute roster plans well, but the concept of trading Hopkins was almost a given."
LETS GOOOOOOO!  Finally the announcer can stop point out that embarrassing statistic for the past multiple seasons.
Wow I didn’t even notice!! Lets go!!
Nah the announcers will just move on to the steelers have turned it over in x out of x+1 games lol.
We also kept our forced turnover streak going!
And two penalties I think
3-0 for the first time in 10 years? Love it!!!
Only took a team with 0 takeaways this season
SQUEE!
THE CURSE IS BROKEN!!!
The announcers were too busy talking about what the Watt brothers had for breakfast this morning. Pretty sure they weren’t even watching the game
"Our pass rush is phenomenal, and they definitely won us this game! I do wish Minkah and the secondary would make a bigger impact, however. They're not bad, but if they were like last year, we'd easily go 13-3 or better I think."
Kept takeaway lead going to boot!
Here we Go !

@ everyone who says our defense is trash 6 minutes into the game
We're getting home when it counts. Bud's pressure leading to the Heyward pick. Edmunds' sack last week. TJ with probably the most beautiful sack of his career a little bit ago. Wealth is spreading won't be long before Juju gets a sack ffs.
And this is why you don't come on Reddit during close or losing games. Or at all really unless it's past the two minute warning and we're up by 28 points. Any other scenario and it's a panic ridden nuclear meltdown where everyone should be fired or retire. Never fails.
Lmao we all know who this is at
"Fair weather fans. Every team has them, but all of ours have reddit accounts."
We have beat bad teams. We never beat bad teams! This year is looking up so far!
"Tbf our secondary has not looked very good through three games. Driskel and Daniel Jones both played well, considering they're both bottom 10 QBs, and we left guys open left and right in the first half. Tightened up in the second half but Mahomes would throw for 400 yards and 4 TDs with the way our secondary has played thus far."
LOL
"To be fair, I think all of the off/rehab time re-fired Ben's competitive engine a little, while letting him get into pretty great shape. 

He's looked less rusty so far earlier in the season than in recent years."
"Multiple things can be true at once. Ben needing to retire is foolish and firing the coaches seems excessive. 

But the secondary *was* awful today generally speaking and hasn't looked great this season overall. Fichtner is a mediocre play-caller at best and actively hurts the offense at his worst - it's no coincidence that some of our best offensive possessions come in the hurry-up when Ben is calling plays himself. Butler is tougher to assign blame to since the secondary isn't executing his playcalls.

And yes, despite that we're still undefeated. And despite being undefeated, those problems exist."
Isn't every team sub this way?
Fichtner sucks and you can’t convince me otherwise
Guilty 😂
We shut out the second half and got five sacks.
"It’s a great start and we’ve had moments of brilliance BUT i am not digging minkah F...no big plays, lots of blown coverage, bad penalties (last week), and Watson completely targeted center field all game..hope he wakes up"
"The teams we beat are a combined 0-9, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We won't know where the team really is until we play the Ravens."
"the secondary is playing terrible.  
danny smith has needed to go for five years.  
fichtner does suck.   
butler does make a lot of bonehead choices.   


where's the lie?"
"I am definitely in the first, second and fourth point. Ben is still in preseason mode. I’ll never judge that hall of famer."
I’ll go to the grave saying fire Randy
"It was refreshing to see opposite world.  Usually the team comes out blasting in the first half, coasts through the second half, and barely squeaks out the win.

As opposed to looking blah the first half, and slowly but surely imposing our will on a bad team up until the end.  Finishing strong was a nice change of pace."
"This game taught me two things.  Fichtner is like okay to decent as an OC, but butler needs gone."

"Very interesting graph.  I feel like the Steelers really got the toughest Texans effort against them as well, since they're in must-win territory right now.  That's a rough schedule to start the season for Houston."
Beautiful
I don’t want to hear any more shit about how we aren’t as good as the rats and Chiefs.
These are really the big 3 in the AFC.  Those Ravens games are going to be huge.
"This, this is what I like to see."
We're good at foosball!
"Texans also having played both of the other games from behind, throwing a lot more and getting some garbage time yards."
I am definitely not a pessimist but how much of this was garbage time during the Ravens/Chiefs games?
This is amazing
great graph
Shouldnt this include points and points allowed?
If we had better clock management in the first half we would've won by 14
The ravens games are going to be insane
They so need to beat Dallas to keep my local buddies quiet.
This graph is awesome. Thanks!
"Saving this one to win some arguments, thanks"
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU IGNORING THE STRENGTH OF THE TEAM FOR ZONE? “Yeah we were great in man coverage last year. Let’s fucking abandon it. So smart.” The Front 4 has been carrying the defense because Butler has apparently gone senile. The secondary has been getting picked apart for 3 games now because we’re not a zone team
"You play zone so when Watson takes off, you’re not caught with everybody with their backs turned."
"A) I don't think he's been calling the D the last couple years.

B) You want to mix in zone because man will without fail break down the way Watson keeps plays alive."
Lmao like clockwork
"I agree I wanted to see a little bit more man but against a guy like Watson, man means he’s gonna be able to scramble because the defenders are downfield with their receivers"
"Ignorance is bliss.

Man, I wish I could ignore matchups, game flow, and personnel groupings and just say “hurr durr zone bad because man was good”"
Keith Butler > HillbillyHaven
Cause he has the confidence that he can do what the fuck he wants.
My favorite part of the game is when they put Vince Williams on Brandon Cooks.
Also hilton got beat in man for the TD
"I'm curious to see this guys post after we win a super bowl.  ""It's great we won and all but it's pretty ridiculous that we haven't fired everyone yet."""
Accurate af.  Butler has no idea what he's doing in the first half
They should have run man on the play where Hilton got the interception. They could have done better than allowing 0 points in the second half
Do you ever actually enjoy when the Steelers win? Or do you to have find something to bitch about to make you happy?

"I don't use the term ""Man crush"" very often but..."
"JJ Watt today: 1 tackle, no sacks, no real pressures from what I recall. 

After what Chuks has shown the last couple of weeks and how well Dotson played in his first start last week, you have to feel good about the future of the o-line. It can be extremely tough transitioning when you've got a veteran o-line that starts aging out, but Dotson looks like a bonafide stud and Chuks has looked as solid as it comes on the right side. Okorafor's footwork really looks refined as opposed to when he was coming out of school. There was a lot of hand wringing when Chuks was drafted but he is showing he belongs in this league. You love to see it."
I could've swore I saw Hawkins jumping in there but idk if it's for the extra lineman package. Looked good.
"I also am a fan of the changes that have been made with the OL.  I was really worried they were going to be a weak link for us, but they are doing a very good job all things considered.  It's not an easy thing to do with so many changes happening all at once."
So good to know that our OL struggles were just because teams were always stacking the box on us. I forgot who the new OL coach is but good work by him
He had 4 tackles... 1 solo... just an fyi
I believe Al walks this off-season allowing to Chuks slide to LT with Banner coming back to play RT for us. If we don't resign Feiler I can see Dotson being our guy at LG too.
Man if they could go into the 2021 draft only needing to add a LT on the first two days that would be really big given the number of folks who are fitting to walk this off season.
"One of their sacks wasn't credited to him, but he was in the pile bringing Ben down. And I think he closed the escape lane. 

Otherwise, our o line has been very impressive. I had my doubts during pre season"
"Claypool, Highsmith, McFarland, Dotson (and Pierre to a lesser extent for being UDFA making the roster)

It looks this might be a legendary draft by the Steelers at this point. 

#And we didn't have a first round pick."
"Let’s see the potential on paper turn into consistent production on the field first.

The rookies have shown enough to get excited but it’s still way too early to call the draft legendary. 

Our 2017 is closer to the “legendary” status but at this point next year, it’s entirely possible the only guy left with us will be Watt."
"Alright simmer down dude. 

Claypool looks like a solid WR2 which is cool. 

McFarland is a complementary back, not an every down back. 

Dotson was a solid pickup for sure but legendary?


EDIT: you know what, I’m sorry dude. Get hype. Fuck yea Steelers! Let’s fucking goooo! 

I’m a drunk asshole."
"Fantastic class for sure so far but I just don’t know if legendary is the right word.

Although I think we might come away with a top 5 class without a first round pick."
""
"I’m convinced Ben is why we seem to be a WR factory. 

He does so many little things you don’t notice. Like going back to Washington immediately after a bad drop to get confidence back, etc. 

Dude is a leader."
"Okorafor was tasked with going 1-on-1 with J.J. Watt for most of the afternoon and he did well.

Watt's stats: 4 total tackles (1 solo), 0 sacks, 0 TFL's, 0 passes defended, and 0 QB hits.

The Steelers were also able to run his way plenty during the game with positive yardage.

Dotson had pretty much a perfect game last week... Now Chucks nearly shutting down a future HoF... I thought our Oline was going to go south after Munchak left.

"Not heating enough appreciation for the guy.  Maybe he hasn’t taken one for a touchdown, but he has yet to have a return that didn’t impress me and I’m sure we got a return TD coming soon"
I like him staying at PR and KR as long as he doesn't muff punts and call a fair catch inside the 10 yard line.
Does anyone have a video of that return where he must shook off the tackle and ran for like 12 yards?
So far I’m impressed by him. Definitely an upgrade over Switz
"A competent return team is a big bonus to have.  It can help turning Losses to Wins as it takes a bit of pressure off both the defense and the offense.

With our kicker back on track to being well above average and our new punter being an alleged improvement our special teams are now better"
I'm super impressed with his contact balance for being as fast as he is. I'm use to our guys just falling over haha
He's definitely going to break one soon. I feel like he's the most dynamic returner we've had in a while
Ray Ray has a CHRONIC fumbling/muffing problem as a PR in college. I've just happy he catches the ball anything he does afterwards is icing on the cake.
"Love this post, ray ray is fucking quick man. Cant wait till he brings one back. Going to miss Dionte a little because he was exciting returning punts but I think ray ray is solid"
I'm extremely apprehensive to hop on the Ray train. What are the odds he's gotten over his fumbling issues he's had his entire career? Seems pretty slim. But I'm warming up.
""
This is the kind of offense I like.  How can a defense pick someone and stop them like we did Saquon if any weapon on the field can be the one being used?
Can I get an F for starting DJ as my WR1 in fantasy with Davante Adams out?
I’m glad to see Ben is starting to connect with Ebron.  He’s the best tight end we’ve had since Heath retired.
This is the way.
You can't cover everybody all the time
"I like this approach more than force feeding every ball to AB, which results in some amazing plays but also creates turnovers. Plus when you have an offense that utilizes all its weapons, a loss of one or two players don't make a huge difference. If you form a habit of relying on one receiver, his absence is felt instantly."

ETA: next week we play the Titans who are 3-0 against teams with a combined record of 1-8, and they've won their 3 games by a combined total of 6 points (IMO Texans might be better than the Titans, but we'll see)."
Can’t overstate this fact enough. But it was good to see the defense play and win against a truly elite QB such as Watson.
Let’s also not look past the fact that 3 of the 9 losses are from us lol
Am I the only one who didn’t think the Texans looked that bad
All of those teams played teams that are currently 2-1 or 3-0 soooooo
Can we just enjoy a win
The fact the we’ve beaten 3 0-3 teams in a row is almost more impressive than beating 3 3-0 teams. We have a history of playing down to our competition and losing to bad teams.

Buzzkill.
Yes but last year we might have beat the 9ers and the Seahawks if we had Ben play. Also our defense was no where near its peak. But I understand your point still. We should beat the Titans if we are a truly good team.
"Yes, but we register one third of those losses as well. Too small of a sample size."

That is impressive.  Means a lot too that banner beat him for the job.  Maybe we have both of our tackles if Villanueva leaves.

"Teams are not throwing at Fitzpatrick and Bush has done excellent in coverage.  Both guys are due for a big play.  Let’s face facts, our team is loaded with talent on the defensive side of the ball.  We’ll be patiently waiting."
"Bush made a ton of huge plays today what are you talking about.

Was responsible for a sack, had a huge TFL, and the biggest PBU of the game.

Not hearing Minkah means he’s doing his job."
"Edmunds is the weak link on our defense, opposing teams attack his side more than Minkah just for that reason. We ALWAYS notice Edmunds getting beat or running behind because offenses target him a lot, not Minkah. If we’re not hearing Minkah being mentioned for a turnover then it’s a good thing from a safety. Pittsburgh hasn’t given him the freedom they gave Troy to roam around just yet, so there’s only so much he can do but lock up his side of the field. The front 7 isn’t letting guys get by them, which is a good thing, so he can’t make too many tackles or force fumbles. 

This happened the second half of last season too, teams started going away from him, and his playmaking slowed down. When Sean davis was playing that position we still heard his name on a weekly basis lol, not in a good way neither. So I’m fine with Minkah keeping his side of the field quiet. I’m sure Pittsburgh will unleash him as the weeks go by, and some teams will take more chances near him. Give it some time."
I always think it's a good thing to not hear Minkah's name. If you never hear his name then he's clearly not committing dumb penalties or getting burnt like Nelson and Hilton did today. Plus don't you think opposing teams watch film every week and try to avoid him? I really don't know for sure if Minkah is playing well or not.
"So when Bush lead the team in tackles and passes defended through two weeks, that wasn't enough?"
Bush has been incredible in the past few weeks. Fitzpatrick has been pretty mediocre in my opinion but that may be because they are not saying his name as much
They don't call your name when. The other team doesn't look your way.
"Nah you’re not watching close enough. They are still making plenty of plays and not everything they do to contribute shows up on a stat line. 

Plus our DLine is so good lots of plays don’t even make it to the second or third level."
Bush has played well. Minkah hasn’t really been beat badly... but yeah he’s not making any splash plays at the moment
You don't understand what you're watching.  Stop having opinions about it.
"Nah. 

Shutout second HALF. We’re fine."
It’s also notable (while not in the same position but something to consider) that Bud DuPree is playing for a contract. So he’s drawing a lot of attention. If he can continue at 75+% of week 1… we’re looking good.

Uggghhh...... Do you actually have any braincells left?
"My argument here is that defenses rely heavily on the 4 preseason games to work out communication and scheme. Since they didn’t have that e are all watching preseason defense expecting more.  They will gel, but I am definitely frustrated like other fans."

"lmaooooo this guy just sits in his basement furiously typing at fans of his own team ""BUT ZONE DOESN'T WORK RAH RAH RAH"" when he doesn't acknowledge that our DBs got beat 1 on 1, too"
So answer me this bud. Would you wanna play man coverage and had all dbs backs turned to the qb who is a very real threat on the ground OR give up a few passes here and there by playing zone and keeping him contained.
Unpopular opinion but I agree. I understand trying to stop the Texans run but a lot of prevent like defense today. Didn’t mix the man blitz in as much until the second half
"I assume we all agree that you *have* to use  Zone, you can't play 100% man.

The question then is what's the right amount of zone. It does feel like we're using it too much, but I don't have any numbers to back that up. We've also been blitzing like crazy -- zone coverage supports blitzing, and allows for more creative/confusing blitzes. Does any website track zone vs man coverage snaps?

Also can you explain how dany/a has literally anything to do with this discussion?"
It's weird that the team probably knows this already. Tomlin actually said today that they played zone so that more guys could have eyes on Watson because of his running ability...
"Get off this sub, you aren't welcome here. Stay in your basement rooting for the Steelers alone, but you really are the worst of this fanbase. Leave the play-calling to the professionals. We won and that's all that matters. There's always justification behind their decisions."

"Seems like people just don’t want to admit this guy is pretty good. Why? I don’t know. Yet another 100 yard game for him, and for a second game in a row he pretty much sealed the game in the 4th quarter.

"I think most people like him as a RB. The problem is his durability. He needs to make it through this season, to begin to change the perception."
"He’s a very good back who can’t stay healthy. I loved what we did today, with all 4 RBs getting snaps. I think a guy like Conner will benefit greatly from that kind of offense. He has the talent, but he just doesn’t have the durability for a workhorse role."
"I don’t think it’s that people are afraid to admit he’s good. I think the bigger issue is, we all KNOW he’s good, but his fragility is keeping us from getting our hopes up. 

I want the guy to go Adrian Peterson bananas!!! I also want him to play all sixteen games."
"He's a good back, but he struggles to remain healthy week to week. Luckily he beat cancer though. I love the guy as a Steelers fan, but I wasn't going to draft him"
"He’s a great RB and a beast, but he can’t stay healthy. I love the man, but we probably won’t re-sign him"
"As others have alluded to Conner is a fine player, he is just very fragile. The frustration is largely about his durability."
"I like the current distribution of the RB's.  Give Conner about 15 carries, split up the rest, don't be afraid to go with the hot hand."
"He’s not great, but he is good. The late game big runs had two pulling lineman creating wide open lanes for him. From what I saw, he only broke 1 tackle, maybe 2 tackles. He is a good blocker and one-cut runner, but is not great at anything.  I will say that he surprised me at the end of the game today with his improved aggressiveness and ball security. 

I also have no problem if he proves me wrong."
"I love the guy, great player when healthy. Just can’t rationalize paying him with his injury history and when his backups have come in and we haven’t missed a beat."
"He's gaining traction again. But let's stick to the committee hopefully. Fresh backs to wear on defenses and keep them honest up front. Then good luck figuring out our go to weapon for Ben. I mean really, who the hell is it? That's a good thing to not know."
It's our fan base they focus on two or three plays he does poorly on and that's the only thing they ever remember
We can't pay a guy with his injury history $12 million a year. The best ability is availability. RB is the most replaceable position in the league.
He is much better running outside than between the tackles. That's really the secret to his big game yesterday.
"What? Nobody ever said he wasn’t good. Not sure if you’ve watched previous seasons, but he’s missed 16 games in 3 years. He’s good but injury prone. This is very much an “entry level” post lolol"
"Very talented, will get hurt tho"
"He’s a good back, would I be upset if we got someone who is more of a every down back. Not at all. He’s good, but honestly people hype him up too much."
"Conner's issue is a two parter.

1.) Our offensive play calling often is predictable as hell and we get stuck in run, run, pass ruts where any defense worth their salt will quickly pick up on it and shut the run down ready for the air game. Doesn't matter who you hand it off to in that case a vast majority of running backs in the league are getting very little. 

2.) Conner has had some injuries and after last season repeatedly coming back when he wasn't 100% and trying to play through injuries because the playoffs were on the line didn't do him any favors. Couple that up with a ankle sprain to start the season and suddenly he's incredibly fragile and has durability issues nevermind all the other season ending injuries happening around the league and since his return he's been productive.

People know Conner is good we just lack consistency on offense right now. Defense is jiving and the offense falls flat. Drives start off strong then fall into predictable patterns. One quarter we're getting nothing on the run game, the next we're chipping them for 5-7 yards a go. 

We get our offensive hiccups ironed out and improve our playcalling so it doesn't feel like Randy is just pulling from his top 10 most recent plays and has no clue he could back out of that menu and see a whole host of formations, play types, and more things will be looking a lot brighter. 

Right now we're doing enough to win the day and that's about it. It's been over a season since we've handily won a game too. That definitely adds to the nerves and doubts."
Who is saying he isn’t good? What people are saying is that he isn’t durable or reliable. Both of which are true.

"I'm all for bitching and whining about the in-game performance, but calling for people to be fired when we're currently sitting at 3-0 is the most embarrassing shit I've ever seen."
I’ve read every post on this subreddit for over a year and a half now. When I first started coming around I was in every game thread. They’re so fucking toxic I had to stop after like week 3 last year.
Guys we could be like the Falcons. I swear this fanbase can be spoiles beyond belief
"Outside of the Steelers, isn’t Tomlin considered one of the best?"
"Is it just me not looking in the thread most games, or was this one particularly bad? I got depressed reading them nearly the second I looked sometime in the second quarter."
The game threads are straight up toxic lol lotta people in here who think the game ends in the 1st quarter when in reality we still got 45 minutes left to play
"Ha! I'm one of those but it's really fun, we all comment stupid shit in the heat of the moment. And really no one curses when the defense allows a big play or when the offense goes 3 and out?"
"Let me preface by saying that I never call for any firing, and I’m 100% a Tomlin supporter, but seeing other Steelers fans pissed off when we’re losing 14-3 kinda acts as a coping mechanism for me, it’s almost soothing 😂"
But we’re cool with Fichtner?
I haven't seen theae for a while though
the only 1 of those 4 I saw was about the first half defense and i don't think they would tell you they had a good first half.
"I'm not sure what people are expecting from a game day thread. Of course it's going to be a shit show. People get emotional about this team and this game and when it doesn't go perfect, they're going to lose their minds in the game day thread. It's just mindless venting people, relax, let people blow off steam and scream through their keyboards. They're not hurting anybody."
Would it be considered doxxing if there was a weekly post-game thread all about links to the people who comment things like this in the game thread?

I heard they brought in some officials to try to clean up the penalties. Kudo's to the coaching staff and the players for showing great improvement.
"Ehhhh... These refs didn't call anything, including several pass interferences on Claypool and an entire games worth of holdings against TJ Watt.

Lightly penalized game.

Good steps though."
"Yeah, had to help having actual refs at practice this week, but the calls were weak this game."
The refs haven’t been calling anything this season.  I think I’ve seen one holding penalty called so far in all three weeks.  Normally there’s 5 or 6 a game.
"As others have said, the calls were pretty bad this game. Several obvious plays should have been called but weren't, and the some of the ones that were called were a bit questionable. I think we should of won the challenge, it looked clear to me Ben passed the first down, and I don't agree with the pass interference on Claypool against the Texans either."
[deleted]
"I’m not mad at it. Looks like our only hard games this year are against Baltimore, bills & colts might end up being better than expected but come on, we are the Pittsburgh Steelers. Cowboys are trash so get that shit out of here. I honestly see us winning 13 games this season easy, and the 3 loses coming off just any given Sunday probability."
I would not discount the Colts fs. Their defense is looking really good. I wouldn't count out the Titans either.
I wouldn't put anything past the Titans this Sunday. You don't get to 3-0 with a bad team.
We’ll learn a lot next week.
"Why are you trying to jinx shit?  Should never discount the rivalry games with Browns and Bengals... and Cowboys can put up points and throw, so not trash."
I'm waiting to see the Browns either do good or bad.
"Hopefully we continue to strangle the opponent’s run game next week. If the defense goes out there and shuts down Henry like they did Barkley, we’ll know that the front seven is for real. Also gotta watch if the secondary does any better against Tannehill, who doesn’t create as much chaos with his pocket mobility as Watson. If Minkah stays home and doesn’t bite on Tennessee’s play action deep shots, I think we could really stifle their entire offense."
"Bills and Titans are both Super Bowl contenders.  Eagles will be tough because they’ll have a lot of guys coming off IR/injury report around that time. Cowboys will be tough. Colts probably will be tough.

It’s much easier than the last couple of years because we get the NFC East and AFC South this year which are probably the worst/second worst divisions in their conferences.

But we also have probably the best Bengals and Browns team in the last few seasons."
"Pump the brakes king. You still have to win what’s in front of you. Going 13-3 is hard no matter who you play. The schedule is easier than most but Bills, Ravens, Colts, Titans are good teams. Browns and Cowboys and even Washington seems competitive. Even the Bengals should be much improved from last year."
If people want to say we have an easy schedule fine. that just means we're going to be super practiced up in time for the playoffs.
Okay after all the backlash I realize I was wrong. We are going 16-0 and the rest of the teams are dogshit. Ravens are the only competition but we will beat them twice.

Texans could still end up a 10 win team at the season's finish.  Giants and Broncos pretty bad though
"Yeah! If only the Steelers hadn't beaten them then they wouldn't be teams with winless records.

That way they could be 0-3 against teams who are all 1-2."
ONE GAME AT A TIME BOIZ
"No excuse for the Giants and Broncos, but the Texans did have KC, Baltimore, and us in a block there ... They might be just a little better than their record."
"The most important aspect of all of this is we are winning the games were suppose to.

We have shown we can get stops, we can make second half adjustments , we can dominate and we ca come back."
"You can only beat what‘s infront of you.

We won all three games without having to rely on a 2min drill to win. We won by kneeling down in the opponents redzone.

Titans will be a tough test, one of the best teams in the division for sure. I think only the Chiefs and Ravens are better (from the teams we will face this year). If we win that it will be a big step towards the playoffs as a wildcard (division will be decided in the ravens games)."
"The Giants are pretty bad, but Denver isn’t terrible. And Houston...I feel bad for Houston. They were a playoff team last year, and the schedule makers decide to give them KC, Baltimore, and a revitalized Pittsburgh team to start the season. Yikes. Nevertheless, I’m happy we aren’t losing to teams that we shouldn’t lose to, unlike past years. Excited to see how we’ll fare next week against a good Titans team!"
Texans are good they got one of the most brutal start the the season schedules ever I bet they still have a winning season
Can you really call them Steelers if they're not Steelering?
"Honestly, I don’t care that Houston is 0-3, holding that offense scoreless in the second half was really impressive. Deshaun Watson is a hell of a football player"
A reason they are they are winless is the loss they took to pitt
"But. That isn't true. We have the second best record in the league over the last 10 years against bad teams.

Edit: apologies, misremembered the stat. We are number 5 against teams with losing records however, we have the second best record in general over that time. https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/evhk9r/oc_record_of_every_nfl_team_against_teams_that/"
"Strength of schedule will balance itself out, and at the end of the year, all that matters is the record.  You can only play the team that’s on the schedule next. Make the playoffs and it doesn’t matter what the opponents’ records were in the first 3 weeks.

You think any playoff team is looking back to W’s over the Steelers last year and saying “Yeah, but Rudolph/Duck was QB and their starting RB and top WR were out too”?

As far as I’m concerned, the fact that they’re beating teams they should beat and even one that was probably a toss up is a good sign, especially given how the Steelers are notoriously slow starters."
"If were going to talk about their level of competition so far this season, we have to look at Titans, who have played two 0-2 teams (almost losing 2 of them) and one 1-2 team, by only like 3-5 points. 

The Ravens have played the Browns and Texans, and the Chiefs almost lost to the Chargers.  No one has truly played a tough year thus far. 

Additionally, look at the stat lines of us, Ravens, and Chiefs against the Texans. We did the best of all 3 teams."
Next week is the 3-0 titans
I think next week is a super important dub we are going to need
A win is a win is a win
"First two should be flipped. ""They only beat bad teams"" is the no brain. ""3-0 is 3-0, they beat who's on their schedule"" is the next level.

I'm glad they're winning at 1:00pm. But next week is a big challenge with a 1:00pm away game. And that said, the Texans could still be a good team when it's all said and done."
"Am I the only one here who thinks Houston is a playoff team? They’ve basically lost to 3 top 5 AFC teams, they have had a horrible start, but look at us last year."
"I don't believe in strength of schedule affecting anything but stats.  Good football teams are good football teams.  If you're a good football team, you'll beat other good football teams.  People would always try to play down the Pats for ""beating up bad teams"" but meanwhile they're in the SB every year.

Every season there's only like 2-3 teams in the NFL who are truly AWFUL football teams, if even that many.  Most ""bad"" teams can still play competitive week in and week out.  And every week is different.  Look at the Giants in Week 1 compared to the Giants in week 3.  In week 1 they still had Saquan, they were hungry to open the season with a win, etc.  Context matters."
CAPTAIN FAT FUCK. LEADER OF MEN
"They did everything they could to lose against Denver! Regardless, I was happy they won."
And the Texans only losses other than us are to the two best teams in the league they really aren’t that bad
"We can only beat what's put infront of us and there's very rarely a gimme in the NFL, we have to improve but at least we know we need to improve while we're winning."
"I would have never thought we could play three zero win teams in a row and not drop at least one. This year's looking up, boys!"
They always play to the level of the team they're playing. We know this.
"Well I always come in here and mention that my second team is the Steelers, grew up a bears fan. So speaking from where the bears are, the Steelers are legit 3-0 like I'll take this team to beat any of the other 3-0 teams, where as with my home team not so much. Also I'm just happy to have Ben back"
What about the play of Oakafor yesterday. He held his own against JJ Watt.
Going into the Giants game I was so nervous about Ben's health and his rust I thought he might throw 2 picks. I truly thought we were going to lose to them because that's what the steelers have done in the past to bad teams when away. Yet we had control of the game all the way through until they got a garbage TD which made the game seem close.
"I mean the defence held Saquon Barkley to less rushing yards than Ben Roethlisberger. I know the Giants O line is trash but still, Saquon is a monster and broke out massively in his 1st season and as far as I've been aware, that Giants o line hasn't massively changed much from when he was first on scene. It takes a lot to keep him quiet is all I'm saying, and very rarely if ever, have I recalled him being shut out a game quite like that one in week 1. Relentless shutdown of the run game. 


Broncos yeah just gutted by injuries. Still a decent team but any team who loses the defensive leader and superstar, along with QB1, is gonna suffer to salvage a season as we know too well. But like you say, that's a team we'd so often lose to despite what the stats and expectations would tell you, so it's progress to not trip up against a side that still had some threats to offer. 

Texans I mean sure no Hopkins and their defence isn't that great overall, but Watson is a bona fide baller, sucks for him that he's come through at the same time as Jackson and Mahomes, but given time and the right team around him, he has every bit as much chance to be a name in this game up there with them. Johnson in spite of the absurdity of that trade, has been playing well for the Texans imo, and overall its a pretty solid offensive team that the Steelers were struggling to stop, but second half it somehow shut out, something nobody else has managed to do yet.


We have yet to see a complete performance, we may never get one, but given we've got an ageing QB fresh off what should have been a career ending injury, with no real long term established experience at WR, a fairly similar group of RBs, nobody is running away as RB1 with much confidence they're top dog over the others for long, the o line has lost a few key pieces but seems to be doing enough now, even if it's not the strength it was a few years ago. The defence is pretty full of ballers, it feels like the coordinator isn't the best strategist, as clearly it can haemorrhage points first half to the Texans, but shut them out second half. Very polarising performances that suggests changes were made that allowed them to do their jobs better.

We aren't running away with it, yes we've yet to face any of the best teams around yet, nothing is screaming that we're favourites or hitting top gear yet, but we are still winning as required, margins genuinely mean nothing, only the results, as the awesome Lamar Jackson, but who also was the not SB winner last season, will tell you he'd rather have won a ring than MVP for blowing teams out the water in regular season, as would any MVP to not win a SB would likely say. The result is what matters most. 

I think it's a team with potential to do well, but is not quite a well oiled machine yet. It could pull off a few upsets and win enough to do something meaningful this season for a change. But winning is the best trend, how you get them genuinely doesn't matter so long as you do. Just ask the Giants when they beat the Patriots and somehow won a Super Bowl out of it despite it not being that good a team overall, and certainly on reg season results, vastly inferior to the Pats at the time. Doesn't have to be easy for it to happen.

Great start Steelers, let's keep them going and not get ahead of ourselves. You get nothing for 3-0 after all."
"You can only play the teams on your schedule.  Should the Titans pose a bigger challenge?  Yes, but..."
Who cares. Keep beating the bad teams and you’ll eventually get a chance to beat the good ones.
Just wait for the Jacksonville game. Then we will know for sure.
lmaoo
Steelers players the giants with saquon Barkley though!
"Texans went up against the chiefs and the ravens the first 2 weeks. Yeah they lost, but still as good as they could do coming from covid. I see the texans as the only good opponent we faced this year, especially with the Giants having no Saquan."

"I actually thought at one point that the refs had a meeting before the game and said because of how good TJ is they are spotting the Texans 10 holds.

I can understand pulling back on some of the iffy calls. but the one play I literally saw the right tackle behind TJ his arm around TJ's neck practically climbing on him piggyback."
"For now I will at least give the refs credit for consistency, they aren't calling holds on anyone. 

I just wonder if linemen will adjust to this leniency and get more bold with holding"
"Also known as the Lawrence Taylor Paradox, when you're so good at rushing the passer that holding penalties cease to exist."
"This isn't just TJ, it's against edge rushers across the league.  The NFL has made a conscious decision to limit offensive holding to clear and obvious (per Walt Anderson) violations.  And the data supports it as it looks like we're on pace to have the fewest offensive holding calls since 2001 in the league."
Yeah it’s a crime that he hasn’t got one holding call all season...
Two touch downs came right after blatant holds on him. I was screaming at the refs.
So frustrating to watch
What's even crazier is that he still put some pressure on Watson at the end there and tracked him. 120% every play.
"I was in a hot take thread this week and predicted that the league would rein in Watt and Dupree If opposing teams fail to.  A lot of people don't realize how fucking massive Dupree is because of his quickness on TV.  At 275 lbs, he's only 10 or so lbs lighter than the likes of Cam Heyward and Aaron Donald.. A guy that big, going that fast doesn't have to play dirty to injure another player.. We saw that with the Denver game and Drew Lock.  The NFL can't make size and speed illegal, nor can they make it safe.  So what I believe they do is use the ambiguity of the rules to allow holding on certain defensive talents in order to level the playing field and keep qbs safe.  I admit that this is only a tinfoil hat theory of mine, but I can't really explain why else certain players get held to death and never get a call for it."
"In defense of the consistency of the refs missing things, my dad and I were both pretty sure that TJ big time got away with a late hit/RTP on this exact play."
This isn’t even a penalty. TJ tried to spin and could t get around all the way. This is one of the few plays that the tackle actually blocked well on
If its consistent across the league then it's not a huge deal to me.
"When the commentator literally says ""well that was a good hold on Watt without getting caught"" I honestly couldn't believe that he didn't get fired on the spot for blatant disregard of the rules of the game, pathetic how much we (the Steelers) deal with this garbage every year, James Harrison got held very much like this every play as well mind you"
TJ is a master of the Deebo dip. I can’t for the life of me understand how the lineman’s arm around TJ’s neck isn’t a hold as he rounds his rush toward the QB
What else are the poor bastards supposed to do? Lol
James Harrison flashbacks.
"Lol he has his hands up calling for a flag like one second in, and the play last for 6 seconds. Ridiculous"
"It’s not holding, actually, it’s just very good technique. Brett Kollman did a video on it on YouTube about the Packers doing it."
"This clip doesn't show any holding by the RT that would warrant a flag. T.J. is on the Tackle's frontside during the whole play, and the RT keeps his arms within his own frame, which is the legal type of holding by a lineman. It's illegal holding whenever the rusher is being grabbed and impeded outside the frame of the offensive lineman.

Edit: that's actually really good pass pro the the RT. However, there probably was a couple of times he got away with holding."
It's probably the reason that the secondary looks suspect this season. If the opposing O line is allowed to hold there's no way that the secondary can cover for that long when we can't pressure the QB. It's actually amazing that we've gotten as many sacks as we have so far with this new interpretation of the rules.
You guys are just jealous. The Texan O line are really big Watt fans and want to love and cuddle him and unlike us they get the chance.
"It was so bad, they could have stopped before the play, wrapped him in bubble wrap and have the O Lineman hug him all day and there still was going to be no holding calls. TJ was still a beast tho."
""
"This is peak r/Steelers, we're discussing a hot take about two teams that aren't the Steelers from a sports writer whom we all hate"
Watson is more talented but since joining the Titans Tannehill has been better.
I’d be way more worried about stopping Henry than Tannehill
"This isn't exactly a hot take. Tannehill was the better QB last season and has been this far this year. Watson has tons of talent and a significantly higher ceiling, but he hasn't been quite the same as he was in '17-18."
Mark Madden is so dumb he makes some of the fans here look like professional analysts.
"Deshaun Watson is a better QB than Ryan Tannehill, but the infrastructure around Tannehill is way better than the one around Watson, so you could argue Tannehill presents the tougher task."
Anyone here think that Madden has actually watched a second of Titans football other than the playoff games last year?
"Relevant:

>4 yards per attempt on non-play action

>20 yards per attempt on play action"
This is par for the course in MM takes. All part of the design.
"We usually match up well with the Titans even when they're the better team.  We just have to stuff the run and not turn the ball over and things usually work out well v. the Titans.  Our inside run stopping has been a little soft this year, so that's no easy feat."
if watson was in pittsburgh. he would be on fire. madden makes foul cunts seem pleasant.
How does he keep his job? Does he have pictures of his boss with like a horse or something?
"Watson is overrated and *probably* overpaid, but Tannehill has only looked good for 1 half season. Need to pump the brakes on him a bit."

"If I’m the Steelers I’m calling the Jets tomorrow and offering a second or third round pick for Darnold. The Jets seem to be an absolute dumpster fire and Gase is probably on his way out. With Treavor Lawerence and Justin Fields up for grabs this year the jets could look to really clean house and start over. Darnold could sit behind Ben for a few years, learn, then take over when Ben retires. We need someone to take the reigns when Ben retires and I think the worst team in the league might have the solution. What are your guys thoughts?"
"You guys go from Rosen, Mitch, darnold. Jesus help me"
"I say no. That’s not taking anything away from Sam, I just think our 2nd or 3rd round pick is more valuable than he is currently. Also, I dont think we have the offensive coaching staff currently who could develop him into a valuable starter worth a 2nd."
"[This play is all you need to see to know Darnold is better than a lot of these guys out here.](https://youtu.be/S0FfuwCely4)

I'm not saying we should do it but somebody has to play QB once Ben retires and we're going to either have to put up with some shit seasons to have a low enough draft pick to draft the next QB, or trade for one. Darnold plays on a shit team with a shit coaching staff. He's trash but he's not really trash."
How does trading Darnold mid-season help either team?
Darnold is ass my dude. Have you watched his decision-making? He looks completely awful.
If you want Sam Darnold and you are convinced the Jets are drafting Trevor Lawrence this year why not wait until Darnold is a FA in another year and not lose the pick?
I would rather prefer to wait in the draft and hope for someone like Trey Lance to drop and we trade up and get him then getting a guy that is still making the same boneheaded decisions he was making in college.
"Why do people do this? Ben’s fine at QB. Yes, he’s getting old. Yes, we are one injury away from Rudolph. Yes, we don’t know how long he wants to play.

But why should we trade for a guy who hasn’t done really anything...let alone offer a premium pick for him?

Nope, I say ride the Ben train till he’s no longer here and realize that either Rudolph will be ready by that time, or let the chips fall where they may and realize we might have a bad year or two...then spend an early first rounder on someone with no baggage from being a disappointment on a shitty team.

I lived through the 80’s...after that decade of mediocrity...I can put up with a season or two of bad football."
In Dobbs we trust
"Ehh, I just don’t know. I agree that Darnold has about the worst coaching he possibly could, but I’m not sure I’m slinging anything the Jets’ way to get him. There are other dumpster fire teams with QBs that don’t look that bad. Tank Commander Gardner Minshew stepped into a dumpster fire and has done everything possible to will that team to wins. He’s somebody I’d throw picks at all day, but not Darnold. He just hasn’t shown enough flashes to be worth the capital."
He’s ruined already
"He doesn't help us in pursuit of a Super Bowl this season, which is the only reason you'd trade a high-round pick for him.

If we're interested in kicking the tires after he hits the landfill, and can do so for pennies on the dollar, that's a different story."
"4th round, tops."
"Not worth a trade in my opinion.  If the Jets want to grab Lawrence in the coming draft they will have to do something with Darnold, if they cut him I'm all for kicking the tires.  If not let someone else pay out the rest of his rookie deal while we continue to make the moves that have kept us a perennial contenders for the last decade plus.  We would never be able to capitalize on his rookie deal as long as Ben is on the roster, so there's no benefit for us to give an asset for him.  Rudolph may never be a starter in this league, but he is a serviceable backup.  When Ben is gone, we can look for his replacement then."
Highly doubt the Jets give up on Darnold for anything less than a top half 1st rounder in value.  Pretty sure they'll give him an opportunity to play with some decent teammates and stable coaching before giving up on him.
There is zero chance the Jets would agree to this and certainly not mid season.
"My confidence in Darnold would be pretty comparable to my confidence in mason, tbh"
"I like the idea of getting Darnold but I say wait until the offseason. No way he puts up anything better than pedestrian stats for the year on a team that won’t win more than 3 or 4 games, so we can get him cheap. I’d say a 4th or 5th, leaving the earlier rounds open to getting some linemen or maybe a running back to secure the offense’s future. He sits a year (maybe more, who knows) behind Ben, and relearns how to play the position. If he doesn’t work out, we didn’t lose much and have hopefully built a secure enough team for a rookie quarterback to come in and succeed."
"Quick, name the last high caliber QB in the NFL that came from USC.

I’ll wait....."
How about a conditional 7th
I actually kinda maybe agree. Darold can ball but he's given no weapons and his coach is an absolute liability. He's miles better than rudolph
"Aside from the other issues mentioned my biggest concern would be his contract.  If he sat behind Ben for a few years his rookie deal would expire and we’d have no clue, other than a few reps at practice, if he was worth paying."
"I don't hate the idea of taking on Darnold as a reclamation project at some point, but I don't see why we should trade away premium picks right now for him. I would rather keep the draft capital."

"Fuck the Titans 


All my homies hate the Titans"
"Like a fake Christmas only to substituted with another first day of school. 

Fuck Roger"
"Yep....that’s exactly how I feel. Free Showtime this weekend on DirecTV...there’s another episode of “The Boys” to watch, and...(OK, you all are going to take my man card away for this)...I started a hobby...diamond painting...

My first one was a 12” x 16” Steelers canvas that turned out pretty cool. I framed it and put it in my office at work. The one I am working on now is a huge one... around 24” x 36”. 

It’s a landscape scene where the tree line is reflected onto water and the combination makes the shape of an acoustic guitar. I am an occasional musician(whenever I feel like playing a gig and can get booked), and I always saw prints of this and wanted one. My wife saw it on a diamond painting website and I told her to grab it.

Weird thing is? I usually don’t like tedious stuff like that...plus, I am partially colorblind...so usually things like that drive me crazy(I freaking HATE jigsaw puzzles). But this is sort of a “paint by numbers” thing that doesn’t require any real skill or color acuity and it’s something you can mindlessly do."
I’m a cowboy fan and I feel bad for you guys. I usually don’t like this team but this is beyond sad this game was taken from you guys with forces outside of your own team’s control.
"So what does this mean, will this act like a bye week for them?"
"It’s 2020, you’d think we’d have found more pixels by then"
*Remembers in 270p*
"Missed all of last weeks game at a wedding. So needless to say, not happy not seeing a game played. When we finally get back out there, I’ll still have only seen the Broncos game recently."
"I always thought our early season byes were a waste. We had them for years, and the rest is more beneficial later in the season when we’re worn down and need to make a run into the playoffs. Not only is this another worthless early season bye, but we spent half the week preparing for nothing instead of resting. Most importantly, I have five players from this game on my tenth year dynasty league fantasy team. I had to replace Derrick Henry with a waiver wire player from the Jets game..."
I wouldnt mind as much but they went and gave the Monday night to us first I was so stoked! then double pissed when it was taken away

"1st being best, 2nd being second best, and so on.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j3wi2x)"
"I just went with 2nd. I feel like he, Justin Simmons, and Adams are probably the best ones. Maybe Derwin if he ever plays again"
"People are so fiercely protective of Minkah Fitzpatrick in this sub. It's very weird.

Minkah finished the season last year the best Free Safety in the league, which is why he was 1st Team All-Pro and the most highly-voted Pro Bowl safety in the league.

He has had a quiet season so far, but has only been targeted 4 times. His only real ""bad"" game was against Denver, and that was mainly because he missed some tackles and had some bad penalties.

Until he consistently proves otherwise, he is still currently one of the best safeties in the league. When it comes to being a pure coverage safety, I would argue he is *probably* the best. I really can't think, in terms of pure coverage, who is better than him right now. Him and Byard basically have the position on lockdown.

Strong Safeties in this day and age play a much different role than an FS, so I think comparing them is pretty useless."
"The ones already named, plus Byard in Tennessee, year-in, year-out.  Fitz belongs among them in the discussion for best.  None stands head and shoulders above the rest.  They all bring different things to the game.  The best any given year will probably be the one who fits his team's scheme(s) best."
Put him behind Adams and Derwin. 3rd for me.
"I love Minkah but I’m pretty sure that Harrison Smith, Budda Baker, Jamal, and derwin might all be better. Derwin it’s tough to say."
"Derwin James, Jamal Adams, Justin Simmons (don't look at that whiff on Darnold last night lol),  Harrison Smith (for now).... I think that might be my list of guys better than him, so no worse than 5th."
I'm just curious why people think adams is better than minkah... I haven't seen much of Adams to be honest... but from what I've noticed Adams strength seems to be his blitz. Its hard to read too much into him when he's played on 2 poor defenses

Bell’s not the same RB that he was when he was running behind Pittsburgh’s O-line. Coincidence? I think not.
"I suspect Bell’s groin injury before AFC championship against NE was much worse than he ever revealed and has been suffering from it ever since. He shouldve gotten a long term contract with another team/coach before he got injured but the Steelers tagged him and Tomlin ran him into the ground, which was the plan all along."
"Please use this thread to post anything.  Doesn't have to be Steelers or football related at all.  Don't downvote in this thread.  If you see someone being a jerk, report it, or message the mods about it.

"It’s been a tough couple of weeks for the family. 

My wife’s father was recently diagnosed with late stage cancer. He’s been given a few months to live. It’s his dying wish to see his  daughter and grandchildren for the last time. So my wife and kids are heading back to the US this week and I probably won’t see them again until January. 

I would go if there wasn’t so much uncertainty about returning. We had to apply to just leave Australia (US travel ban in place) and there is no certainty about returning flights. Currently Australia is only allowing 6,000 entries a week and that’s because they want to manage the number of people in government run quarantine facilities. So we decided that I needed to not risk my job. 

Look, I am sorry, but if the US was not so much of a shit show right now I would be able to be with my family while my wife’s father passed away. If Americans would think about how their actions affect other people the country would be in a better place. 

It seems like such a different country I left 10 years ago."
"The last time the Steelers had a losing record was when the 2003 team finished 6-10. The following year they finished the season 15-1, with a rookie QB Ben Roethlisberger. How old were you in 2003? I was 25."
My anxiety has been really bad lately. Football helps.
"I was supposed to be leaving on a 4 day deer hunt this weekend. Then little Ms. ‘Rona said “Nope! Your ass is going nowhere.” I was like, ok, well at least I can watch the Steelers play while I’m isolated. Then Ms. ‘Rona said, “Fuck you, you ain’t watching that fools ball.” Fuck this stupid virus and everything it does."
"I'm putting in my two weeks notice today at my second job.

At first it was great but out of the 4 people who trained me only 1 is left. The manager there literally tried to push away someone who had worked there for 6 years and was easily his best worker because it was no longer convenient to keep her around. 

Then this past Sunday I came in and nothing was done to the store the night before. I mean absolutely nothing. It took me 3-4 hours to recover the store and when I questioned my manager about this he just said it was busy. Yet when I first started out, he'd keep me late to recover the store and do the dishes. The only person who helped me out with the dishes, someone else does too but she doesn't typically close, was the one he pushed and forced out.

Then it was confirmed the driver he had working the night before straight up didn't even do any of the chores. The manager just doubled down and said it was busy even though he had a solid hour and a half without a delivery to do something about it.

So I just about had it. Time to move on from that place, find a second job that's fun to work at again."

"You gotta calm down man. He also said that he loves Ben, never anything about replacing Ben with Darnold. You’re obviously just mad because you have a dilemma against JuJu. Calm down, it’s just a game."
"If you don't already know the answer to this, it's probably better to keep your mouth shut and avoid looking like a complete fool, rather than professing strong negative feelings about something so completely innocent as a college friendship a reporter asked about specifically."
You're flipping about something you didn't even bother to take 20 seconds to understand. He didn't say he wants Darnold over Ben. Go find something else to throw a hissy fit about
"He gave a statement of support to a former teammate and (presumably) a good friend of his. Nothing to see.

Also - hope Roethlisberger sees this man!"
Somebody didn’t listen to the interview. “Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.”
Non story. Juju was asked about Sam who was his QB in College and said he would welcome him to the Steelers. He didn't say Ben needed to be benched or that Sam should be our starter now.
"He was his qb in college and we KNOW how he feels about ben from everything to his first game back to him not playing well with mason and duck, not to mention I think he said ""ben will always be my guy"" (or along those lines) right before. And it wasn't like he posted it on social media or anything. someone specifically asked him about it. 

&#x200B;

>This dude never shuts his mouth 

wow man you really need to grow up he's a quality player with a fun attitude I think you need to shut up right about now"
Well Ben is 38 with only a couple years left on his contract. If the Steelers win it all before his contract is up he’s retiring. Why not take a chance on Darnold if they can get him for a good deal?  Mason sure isn’t the answer for the future.
What a troll.  Mods remove this man

We were offering Bell a ton of money, we just had less guaranteed because he couldn’t finish a season. We didn’t opt to save our money, Bell wanted more guaranteed and less incentive"

"Bell is still the winner here no matter what. 


Wanted guaranteed money. Got guaranteed money."
Yeah but how many recieving or all purpose yards does he put up?

Good luck Buffalo
What happens if they can't play next weekend as well? Their bye week is this week now.
"Wow. Full on outbreak in their team. The Steelers really need to stay strong in terms of following guidelines, or this kind of spread can seriously derail what’s looking like our contender team. Let’s be happy that we didn’t play the Titans on Monday or Tuesday!"
"What does that bring the total to now?

Edit: I read in the /r/nfl thread that it’s up to 16. 8 players and 8 staff."
"Yeah NFL & NFLPA screwed the pooch on this one.

With no preseason the season should have started ~3 weeks early so you can give each team 3/4 bye weeks built in to the season so that when this happened, it was an easy fix"
honestly is there even a mid season fix to these kinda issues? you'd assume to nfl would plan something right? ffs
Wow. Hope everyone recovers fast. This likely won't be the last outbreak unfortunately.
Make february titans month. Every team plays them daily.
So are they gonna take Buffalos bye week too or just cave and make Ten forfeit games like they should have a week ago?
"It's a good thing our game this week was ultimately cancelled, but it's ridiculous that the NFL didn't forsee such a thing happening and schedule make-up weeks. No team should have to forfeit a bye over something like this."
There should a league wide by week after week 10 and 17 to play make up games
"Fuck the Titans.
  
They should have forfeited.  You cannot add weeks and manipulate the schedule *ad infinitum*.
  
Fuck anyone who says otherwise."
The NFL should’ve seen this coming. They should’ve created a bubble for its players like the NBA did.
Member when people were saying the SB/playoffs should be delayed and makeup weeks should be tagged to the end of the season but r/nfl said canceling and shuffling bye weeks was better.... I member.
"I swear we accepted a curse to win that 6th super bowl. From that Jags loss in 2017, to the AB drama and crazy ways we found to lose games in 2018, and now we are 3-0 in a season that looks unlikely to finish properly. This sucks."
I really hope the NFL has a back up bubble plan.
Shit
Fuckin covid ain't breaking through the steel curtain!
You guys got screwed with the bye week change
How likely would it be to spread against teams they have played? I mean they are wearing mouth pieces and it's not quite the same as sharing a locker room and traveling and bunking together. I'm willing to bet teams that played them are getting a bit paranoid though. Hopefully everyone recovers and there are no permanent side effects. Would be devastating for a professional athlete. Hopefully our Steelers take this very seriously and don't get sick themselves...
Fucking idiot titans.

Welcome to bye week hell NE and KC
KC practice squad QB just tested positive.
"Hard to imagine no one else caught it if it’s the QB testing positive. I wonder if the Pats and Chiefs game gets postponed as well. Let’s hope this stuff doesn’t get out of hand, can’t have the season get canceled"
With all the money and resources the NFL has at there disposal how they didn't come up with a better plan is beyond me
And so it begins
"At this point I’m not salty about the Steelers-Titans getting postponed. I just don’t want the season to get postponed/cancelled after everyone tried so hard to keep the season going as normal. I get it’s a pandemic, but if it keeps getting worse, then i guess there’s no other choice..."
Our boys are getting really close to finishing the season undefeated!
They are going to have to tighten shit up (my guess is more isolation for teams would probably be what it would take) league wide if we're going to make it a full season.
just remember there are some very familiar faces on this sub who were being unfathomable fuckwads about the Titans situation days ago saying how covid is totally avoidable and they should forfeit the game and what not - this was bound to happen in this sport given the logistical variables and anybody with a modicum of integrity or intelligence would have seen this coming from ten miles down the Monongahela or at least been able to critically analyze the situation and not just be an uncaring jagoff
Here comes the house of cards... Shouldn't have messed with the schedule when there was obviously gonna be more postponements.
"I honestly just have such a hard time getting invested into this season. It’s such a shit show. Even if the season does finish, it feels like the winner should have an asterisk beside their name because of this whole thing.

What happens when it’s 2 days before the super bowl and Patrick Mahomes and Ty Hill test positive? They gonna postpone the super bowl? Let the NFC team just cake walk to the trophy?

This is just so stupid at this point."
"Patriots’ QB Cam Newton tested positive and is out for Sunday’s game vs. Kansas City, per @FieldYates and me.

I'm curious who the guy right of TJ is.
"Edmunds haters in shambles rn

Also can someone explain Bud in the ""other guys"" category."
Bit surprised Tuitt is lowish this year... but still bouncing back from that injury and the lack of a preseason
"If the NFL can figure out a fair way to have make up games, that would be great. If not, I believe the fairest way to to handle these situations is to simply cancel. No draws. No forfeits. The playoff standings are determined by win percentage. If you make the game a tie or a draw it penalizes teams and makes their win percentage go down. However if you simply cancel the game, you can go by win percentage still whether it’s out of 16 games or 14. So let’s say the titans went 9-5 for 14 games. They would be place below teams that go 10-5-1 or better  and above teams that go 10-6 or worse."
Add two weeks to the end of the season (weeks 18 and 19) for make-up games.  No law says the super bowl can't be second or third week of February.
"That can leave huge unfair advantages. What happens if the Titans don't contain the virus and it slowly spreads through their players from now until the end of the season? Then they're still 3-0 with a 100% win percentage even though they've only played 3 games. 

They should play whatever games they can safely play, but plan to extend the season as need be. Hell, maybe by late March we could have a vaccine and a Superbowl with a live audience."
I wish everyone would stop bitching about this - it’s a global pandemic and the players are taking their chances. Probably won’t be the first or last time this happens.
"We're not doing a pro bowl this year, no? Push the playoffs back a week, and leave week 18 for makeup games. Besides that, if your team cannot manage to abide by the constraints and ends up missing games, the way Tennessee is, then forfeit."
"Nah just extend the season of cancel it.

That’s not a good idea. Everyone needs the same opportunities to win/lose games. What happens if that 9-5 team was gonna lose out? Or win out? It’s not fair a 10-6 team is essentially penalized for playing a full schedule OR a 9-5 team is penalized for not getting to play a full schedule.

It’s nice in theory, but not practically."
"I feel like honestly if we’ve been given a great opportunity here. The Titans as well to some extent. We got to play 3 games and, now, rest our starters through what appears to be the end of a preseason. This feels like a great way to start the season all things considered. We get to rest and recover on what will become our playoff run. I think we will win a good deal of them, probably 70-90 percent of them if you asked a dumbass like me lol.. we might lose one or maybe a few but find our rhythm and get deep in the playoffs and hopefully take the Lombardi home. 

I’m pumped man honestly I love football weekends and seeing our guys go out and rack wins. Every time I see the Steelers play it reminds me of times with my late homie and man I love that feeling. Let’s go boys. Let’s pull it together and take one home"

I’m so glad every single comment in here is a unanimous call for him to be cut

Anything less, and your number goes back in the hopper.

IMO, this allows you to make a case for 52, 59, and 47.  The greatest C, off-ball LB, and beatdown style CB of all time.

The purpose of retiring numbers is supposed to be to honor the greatest of the greatest of your franchise.  Not to placate millennials who need their era to be just as good or they'll pout.  It's not sufficient to have a helmet cake named after you."

I’m all for it.  A strong AFC North is a good thing for the Steelers.  Iron sharpens iron.

They all played shitty teams. It happens.
His name is Jerry Jones.
"Because the AFCN has been a really good division for a couple years now (Browns held themselves back for a few years but they've always been on the verge of being good). 

Because they played a combined 3-9 schedule this week. 

Because the Steelers can never have anything given easily. 

We play those same Cowboys, Jags, and Redskins later this year too. Who cares if the AFCN won against those teams. All that matters is that we do too. We can't let bad teams keep games close (like Houston did last week). We also still have to play all three of our divisional opponents twice this season. 

What they did this week doesn't matter at all unless the Steelers can't go do the same thing when their turn comes. And if the Steelers can't beat those shit teams but the Bengals and Browns can then we don't deserve to talk about how we're at the top of the division."
Browns looking scary this year.  Burrow will have the Bengals winning more games soon enough - good win today.

Jesus the Steelers are 7/13 Broncos sacks......thats BANANAS
"The idea in r/nfl that we've only gotten sacks cause we're facing bad O lines is sooo dumb. We're also getting pressure at historic levels even for a pass rush that has been the best for the past few years. Also part of the reason they've sucked is because they've played us. 

Anyways, last year we demolished some of the best O lines like the Colts and Ravens so that should be more proof that this is just a monstrous pass rush."
Anyone else worried about sleeping on the eagles?
"None.
  
The Eagles will have positive COVID tests and the game will be cancelled because the NFL won't make a forfeit happen (for some reason) and the season will not be extended."

Jones escaped just barely in week 1 to keep the totals low.  We feasted on the Broncos and, surprisingly, on the Texans even with Watson being elusive.

Unless Wentz runs for his life, it's going to be a long day for him.  Honestly, 5 is on the low end, but this week off might have us come out a little slow to start."

"As all Steelers fans know, as soon as a backup qb subs in for another team, they start lighting our defense up.(ex. Hoyer with colts, Driskel with Broncos)
Could this maybe be because tomlin and butler gameplan well against the starting qb, so when the backup comes in, we aren’t prepared for them, or do you think it is something else?"
"> Could this maybe be because tomlin and butler gameplan well against the starting qb, so when the backup comes in, we aren’t prepared for them

Yes. All teams have this, it's a well known thing. You can't game plan for someone who you have no tape on, etc.

Beyond that, the opposing team completely changes their offense in most cases since the backup can't run the starter caliber offense and has different strengths and weaknesses - and you aren't prepared for that either."
"Game planning plays a huge role.  I also think that backups tend to go into it with a “nothing to lose” mindset and make some unexpected big plays.  After a few weeks, you’ll typically start to see why they don’t start ie. Duck and Rudolph last year."
Yeah. It's how Mason Rudolph almost beat the Seahawks last season and Duck came in and would've likely beat the Ravens in week 5 if not for the Juju fumble. What matters is we won against both of those QBs tho.
"This is not a Steelers phenomenon it is a league wide phenomenon. The game planning is the biggest factor as others have said. Even ""similar"" QBs will have different types of plays they're good at or different defensive looks they're good at identifying, then imagine going from a pocket QB to a guy who can run a bit. Much easier for the offense to adjust than the defense. 

But also the tropes of bringing in a backup QB midgame to 'inject some life into the offense' have some truth to them. Imagine being a backup QB and getting your name called in the 3rd quarter. You're thinking ""this is the moment I've been waiting for for weeks/months/years"" and your adrenaline is going to spike. That energy is going to translate to the offense. 

We saw this happen last year when Ben went down Rudolph led a couple scoring drives against the Seahawks. When Rudolph went down Duck led a scoring drive against the Ravens. When we benched Duck Rudolph led a scoring drive against the Jets. Last night the Pats benched Hoyer and Stidham led a scoring drive vs the Chiefs. Last week the Bears benched Trubisky and went on a tear to win the game, only for Foles to fall on his face when he played a team that got to gameplan for him."

With the Browns game the week after this is another lower tier team that we need to clean up, because the AFCN isn't slowing down either unfortunately."
Hopefully that's the positive now. Steelers football every week till the run to the Superbowl!
I have to imagine our D line can barely contain their excitement at the threadbare patchwork quilt that is the Philly o line.
"With how bad the Philly o-line is, we should beat the breaks off of Wentz"
"The Browns are making some plays and it's their super bowl when they play the Steelers. I loved seeing the Browns beat the cokeboys. I'd like to see the Browns become more competitive and let the bungles be the doormat of the division forevermore.

Eagles are usually a pain in the butt for the Steelers. I can't explain it."
It's going to be advantageous I imagine to have a week to see how the Browns offense functions with the absence of Chub. Not saying D'Ernest Johnson won't be a problem as he chuncked the cowboys pretty good on Sunday; but I'd much rather go against him than the Chunt combo. Hoping to also see this secondary come together and create good communication this week. We will need it after seeing OBJ's performance on Sunday. I'm not looking past This Eagles team that's riding a pretty great high from the 49IRS; I'm just hoping this Steelers team can clean up holes they've had in previous weeks and showcase it.
"When you consider that this team starts slow in September usually...I'd be a bit worried if I was the rest of the league. You can't sleep on the Steelers or you get what the Steelers used to do against weaker opponents. 

I hope the rest hasn't made them rusty at all. Can't come out in the 1st quarter asleep."
I am horrified of this week. This game stinks of a trap game.
"We need to start hot, so it forces wentz to drop back. Then we can torture him... 


Completely remove their run game"
"Please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this week's opponent including weaknesses, strengths, or info on lesser-known players you think will have an impact.

If you are a fan of the opposing team, feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above and/or ask us about the Steelers."
"I think the most interesting matchup is going to be in the trenches. We both have solid D-Lines but, and correct me if I'm wrong, the Steelers O-Line doesn't seem as solid as the Eagles'."
"How are your TEs? The Eagles LB core is not very strong, and TEs are very powerful against teams with no LBs, especially those TEs who are big, as they can match up easily with corners."
Last week felt so long after we didn’t have a game. Feels good to be back and I’ve been waiting on this thread
[removed]
"I think this is going to be the game that proves to me that we are no longer the Steelers of the past 5 years. I think in the past this is a game the Steelers don’t show up for and lose against a middling to poor NFC opponent. I was looking forward for the test playing against a good team like the Titans, but I really want to see us win this game handily on Sunday. Our defense is the best in the league, but I want to see our offense take the next step so bad. But as I’ve said to my friends, I think if we score 25-28 points per game this season we go like at least 13-3, so the offense doesn’t have to be spectacular."
"I am ready to feast on the Eagles O line, I think this should be a solid win if they start on the right foot."
"Our D lines have the most (Eagles) and 2nd most (Steelers) QB hits. Bless the knees, Carson and Ben gonna get hit"
Why is this thread in contest mode again? Makes this way less functional
"Hey Steeler country!  Eagles fan here!  Looking forward to a hard hitting, competitive game.  Definitely gonna see lots of good defense and who the hell am I kidding we’re gonna get smoked."
"What weaknesses, either offensively or defensively, do you feel the eagles should try to exploit? 

For the Steelers, offensively, I would test those Eagles LBs all damn day.

Defensively, bring the heat on Carson. Our OL has been playing better than expected considering all the injuries, but they are young and inexperienced."
"I actually think this may be a close game. I can see the Eagles being VERY hungry after a confidence booster in beating the 49ers. The Steelers are going to be well rested, but who knows if they play down to their opponents yet again. We shall see. In any case, looking forward to another edition of the Battle of PA!"
"How are the steelers going to handle upcoming tickets? Comparing this to what the eagles do. Anyone get any info as a ticketholder? 


I can’t imagine want to pay thousands to watch a bad eagles team lose in a mostly empty stadium but I am curious how both our cities and teams will handle this inside PA guidelines"
"You guys are probably getting 10 sacks, I'm starting your D in fantasy lol"
"TJ Watt is going to win DPOW after this game, the tackle is going to be a turnstile"
"how has your offensive line been? the Eagles biggest strength so far has been their front four, and more specifically, their ability to rotate quality players with fresh legs in at the end of games. i believe we lead the league in sacks (albeit 13 of those sacks coming against the bengals and the 9ers)."
"Is Chase Claypool ready to break out? Going up against either Maddox (small) or Mills (slow), this may be a game where he plays a big role and puts up big numbers. Juju should get mostly erased by Slay, but beyond that you guys should do fine. Our Linebackers are horrific,  our D-Line is pretty damn good and safeties are 🤷🏼‍♂️
Offense.... let’s just say I’ll be starting the Steelers D in fantasy this week."
Where do yall think the Eagles can exploit the Steelers
This could be a potential Super Bowl preview.

I fear that botched call was the symbolic passing of the torch from one NFL evil empire to the next.
Jesse James caught that ball BTW
"I just wanted to remind everyone, in light of these trying times we are living in, that Jesse James caught that football. Thank you for your time."
"The best part was watching pats fans meltdown about how Mahomes is the NFL’s golden boy and that he gets so many calls it’s unfair, yet they just spend the last almost two decades being the benefactor of having the golden boy."
Watching Patriots fans meltdown in the game thread was quite delicious!
"I mean, i can feel them. That was a shit call that changed the entire game. We should expect better from the refs and from the NHL. That being said, I feel absolutely no sympathy for the fans of the team that told us all BuT ThAtS ThE RuLe. Jesse litterally caught that ball FACING THE THROW AND WAS ABLE TO TAKE A STEP, TURN IT UP FIELD AND STRETCH IT UPFIELD. They changed the stupid fucking rule because of it. It changed the ENTIRE outlook of the playoffs. Yet we were called crybabies and told to deal with it. Fuck them and their childish fucking fanbase couldnt have happened to a better team."
I wish them decades of misery.

"He was from Pittsburgh and wanted to play here, alot of people wanted him in the team. I rember he went on rich eisien shiw and he said they never contacted him lol. He wanted to play he would live at his moms and wasnt too far from staduim. He said he wrote to teams that didnt cintact asking then why lol. Was it because we had heyward etcm and didnt need him. Even though he was a pittsburgh kid. Or they didnt see anything in him.You think steelers would be interested in him. Since we love michigan players and he was a michag player and kid was from from Pittsburgh and wanted to play for steelers."
"I'm sure we would have taken him with our second 3rd rounder in 2019 if he was still available - it wasn't an area of need really, but we've usually gone BPA through drafts.  However, if you remember 2019 was the year we traded our 1st and 2nd round picks to move up and select Devin Bush, so we didn't have a pick until the 3rd, which we used to draft an impact WR and replace MBC.

Also, a lot of draft analysts had Winovich going at the end of the 1st round, so the industry was obviously a lot higher on him than NFL scouts."
"I don't know that they weren't interested in him, but when they traded up for Devin Bush, it kind of took Winovich off the table. There were plenty of rumors that the Steelers liked him, although that may have been smoke screens to cover for their interest in Bush.

The Steelers had a lot of needs going into that year that were ahead of EDGE - ILB, CB, Safety, X-Receiver, etc. and the only chance they had to take Winovich was at the Johnson slot.... if he had fallen a half dozen picks more to the spot where they took Layne that would have been interesting."

I know :( I figured if you put all three Watts on the field they turn into ExodiWatt and become that custom Madden player you made when you were a kid who was 7 feet tall with all 99 stats
Exactly what I thought when I heard the news.
"I thought that was Steeler fans realizing we couldn't put JJ's contract on the roster even if they left him in a basket on our doorstep, along with a note begging us to give him a good home."
"Watt-Watt-Watt coming for your QBs butt-butt-butt

Edit. Shit, didnt think this through. Derek will change his name to DJ when he puts on 200lb moves to nose tackle."
"Sorry to sound stupid, but why?"
"JJ wants to win though. If Texans can't turn it around he may want to leave and what better place to go than a team who has a top 5 defense (want to say #1, but idk about all around stat wise), a decent offense, and his 2 brothers. There's still hope, but it would be when his contract is up or unless the new coach wants to dump the old guys to clear some cap or get some picks."
JJ is past his prime and only plays about half the year hurt all the time. Why steelers fans want him is beyond me
Hansen brothers!
Achievement collected! MAXIMUM WATTAGE
"JJ has declined drastically. Whens even the last full season he's played? Or close to full season?

Wouldn't even want him... at least not for what he makes. Vet min, come on down. Can play second to Hayward. Otherwise, hard pass."
Don't need him. Especially with signing Cam
"Idk why Steelers fans are so hot on jj watt. He’s a DE in a 3-4 defense, which puts the onus of of sealing the edge and edge rushing on the DE. We run a 4-3 though. Our DEs are inside rushers and run stoppers. Even if he somehow did become fast enough to play OLB, who are you gonna replace him with? Tj and bud have been playing gang busters."
"JJ has missed 32 games over the last 4 seasons. 

Much like Conner, both are great guys, but we need players healthy and on the field, especially during Ben's last few years under center.

To me, the ""cool"" factor of a 7th Lombardi outweighs that of Watt x 3."

"Wow, TJ on one side and JJ on the other would make nearly every QB in the league shart before every snap."

Wheeee!  Let's break up the undefeated team!
We need to figure out who we would replace him with before we talk about trading.  Not to mention we will also be looking for replacements for bud and alualu this off season too.
Nothing bc the Steelers wouldn’t mess with a defense like this. That would be stupid
Lol he’s due $9 million salary next two years.  His cap hits 15 but that’s due to dead money from restructuring.  So we would barely save any money while trading away a stud.

"I love wearing my Pens jersey around Philly just to piss everyone off.  But I really hope we win this week.  Had amazing seats the last time we played in Philly, surrounded by Eagles season ticket holders, and getting blown out like we did was so frustrating.  Would really like the boys to return the favor, knock them down to 1-3-1 so I can just smirk at everyone in the office on Monday."
In the same boat. Though I’ve never had anyone give me shit for wearing Steelers stuff. It’s the Penguins stuff that’s dangerous.
"""Bad things happen in Philadelphia"""
I used to live in Manayunk across from Pitchers Pub. We would hang a giant banner of the opposing team (that was playing the Eagles) each week just to piss off Eagles fans. They're stupid.
I would normally think the same but the Eagles are horrible and so are their fans. The fans have given up already.
Bro I live in Baltimore I feel you
"Me being in Philadelphia this week\*  


FTFY"
I'd start the drive to Pittsburgh early if I were you... eagles fans are not people to mess with when they're angry and drunk...
miss those gameday gatherings that used to be held weekly at the Plymouth Meeting Dave & Busters. Typically got over a hundred steelers fans in a rented out ballroom with tons of projectors of the game and all the food and beer you could want. those were the days
On the incline
I’ve got my giant Steelers flag flying in Delaware County...and several Nest Security cameras
I taught my kids early to hate Philadelphia because their fans throw snowballs at Santa.
Philly is one of the dirtiest cities on Earth.
"My Uncle passed away a week ago. He was a fucking huge Steelers fan and made me hate you guys. 😂

He has the steelers tatted on his body, gets a tattoo for each year yall win the superbowl, has about 20 jerseys and shirts, and conformed a lot of the family, and my brother into Steelers fans. 

At his visitation this weekend, yall wouldve loved it. Half the family was in steelers gear and custom JB jerseys. Even me(it burned my skin)

Im an Eagles fan coming in peace mostly just for an excuse to talk about it 😂 Hopefully its an entertaining game and you guys don't hurt poor Carson behind that OLine missing 4ish starters 😂 I used to always hate the Steelers, but now its all love. 

Good luck guys! Drink a beer for my uncle steelers faithful."
Sorry for your loss. Just remember we were teammates once. STEAGLES FOREVER!
"RIP Your Uncle.  Halfway through that beer already.

Sorry for your loss.  And for Carson Wentz."
"Condolences!

It’s going to be a long day for Wentz."
"I’m a Steelers fan married to an Eagles fan and living in Philly, I feel you on the emotional complexity in this. The nice thing is we’re in different conferences and don’t play that often so the hatred rarely has a chance to get too hot.

Edit: and I should add we hate a lot of the same teams, like the Cowboys and Patriots."

"That sucks man. Sorry for your loss. My dads best friend was an Eagals fan, he also died. Luckily, it was after the Eagles-Pats super bowl, so it was kind of an homage to him because he wasn't doing so well in the hospital those days.

Still fun though."

"I'm so sorry for your loss! Thanks for stopping by to share your story. 

I'm from Philly, and currently live several miles outside of it. Growing up I lived with just my mom, who is from Pittsburgh, and I quickly became a Steelers fan. My husband is an Eagles fan, as are all of my in-laws and my dad's side of the family.  I've become very good at cheering the Eagles on while secretly hoping they lose spectacularly.  

I've tried so many times over the years to like the Eagles, but I just...really don't like them. I've been to one Eagles game and caught the worst cold of my life soon afterwards. It ain't meant to be."
I smell some love for us ...actually hehe enjoy the match and I will drink some wine (I’m Italian lol) in your uncle honor my friend

When they played the Pats in the Super Bowl, I traveled across the state on Super Bowl Sunday to watch the game with him. One of the best football watching experience of my life. Thank god for Nick Foles."
Sorry for your loss man. Sounds very sad but I’m glad you are(atleast seem to be) doing better. Cheers to your uncle and cheers to a good injury free game!
"It's a shame Steelers and Eagles aren't in the same division.  I'm a little sick of playing teams that don't matter like cinci and cleveland. Playing Philly 2x a year would be far more interesting.

Though we will certainly take the 3-4 free wins a year playing ohio teams."
Don’t worry we’ll win this one for him. 💪🏻

"Trey Lance is going to be one of the top QB’s in the 2021 draft and is expected to go about in the top 10, so I wouldn’t get my hopes up if I were you."
"Oh snap! We are starting with the ""Should we, could we, can we's"" EXTRA early this season lmao"
When was the last time a QB drafted as a sophomore did anything at the NFL level? And does he even fit the Steelers offensive system? I’ll pass
"This draft will likely be more unpredictable than the one that just happened. 

All I can say for sure is that I would like a Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields, or Trey Lance. I cannot say we can realistically expect *anything*. 

Not to mention that teams either have QBs at the end of their career (Brees, Matt Ryan, Brady, Rivers, Big Ben, etc), QBs that are good but not great (Minshew, Bridgewater, Goff, Carr, Tannenhill, Cousins, etc.), or their organization is likely to look for a change to see if something sticks (Darnold, whoever Denver’s QB is, Trubisky/ Foles, Jones, Haskins, etc.). 

I can see more than half the league having a reason to take a QB this coming draft. Some less plausible than others, but still a non-zero chance. 

**TLDR**: I doubt we even get a chance to"
"Is there literally ANYONE in the world you people don't think this team should be pursuing?  You're like my kids at the grocery store.

Fine.  I'll bite.  What do you know about him that I can't learn from looking at his stat sheet?"
Would love to get him but can't see him falling that far
Sure let's begin tanking! /s
"Stop it. Ben will be our QB until the wheels fall off....and most likely, we will have to suffer a year or three of shitty records in order to find the next Steelers QB.

ANd as far as I am concerned(which amounts to a thimble full of spit), Ben has earned that designation."
honestly i hope we can snag Darnold for a 2nd or something when Jets take TLaw
"I'd love the pick, but God-willing he's going to be long gone before the Steelers get to the podium."
Finna need 31 teams to sleep on him before we can pick him
Finna need 31 teams to sleep on him before we can pick him
"He's likely going to be a top 5 pick, with some experts saying he will challenge Lawrence as QB1 in the draft. There's no way he falls to us, so it really isn't even worth discussing."
I could see Pittsburgh taking him but it would need more than likely a Devin Bush draft pick move

Diontae Johnson is also poorly done in this game *sigh*

"All rookies and c and below players look awful. Most superstars look amazing, and then notable players usually too. Unfortunately some stats are left out, just looking like rando models, but they took their time with many studs. That game is scary with how good players look. Devin Bush, Minkah, Conner look amazing. And DeCastro, Watt, Tuit, Cam, Pouncy, JuJu, Enron, Haden, Bince, Snell, Terrell, Ben all look good with scans for sure 
Other players that look spot on around the league are Shaquem Griffen, David Njoke, , Levante David, Mahomes, Kahlil Mack, Amari Cooper, Tua (i traded for him in madden franchise once Ben retired lol), etc etc.

EA scans faces, once they do the player usually looks darn near perfect.
Diontae and Chase, for example, either never got scanned or go need to rescan because the other WR and RB like Snell, Conner, and JuJu look nice!"
this is bad but its honestly not as bad as I've seen others.. I'm expecting them to be able to support at least face scans off their roster photos with the PS5/Xbox Series S but who knows. They put in close to zero effort with things like this.

"It’s like that pic of the kid with veins popping out of his forehead and “when you haven’t badmouthed the Steelers in 5 min.”

It’s not even the anniversary of it or anything, just a total “shit on Steelers” post."
Honestly people on this sub blinded by bias on this one i think this isnt blatant either way but i think for sure it was intentional
"1. He was already standing there, so the notion that he “ran over” to disrupt the play is not true. 

2. He also could have definitely got out of the way much quicker. Whether it was just a brain fart or something else is up for debate. 

3. Whether it was intentional or not really doesn’t matter. It should have been a 15 yard penalty either way, but the fact that people were calling for any supplemental discipline was extreme."
"So this is the first time I've seen a thread pop up on /r/nfl about it, and people are still like *furious* about this. Even a couple steelers fans chimed in to say that Mike did this on purpose.

I'm not sure how anyone could look at that in real time and assume it was anything other than an accident. Is it common opinion that Tomlin did this on purpose? People really think Tomlin thought ""Oh fuck yeah, I'm gonna trip him""?

I'm always open to changing my opinion, and I just don't see any part of this that wasn't just a stupid mistake"
"People still think Tomlin did this on purpose? Jesus Christ. It's more believable that Jacoby fumbled every ball as a steeler on purpose because he was still pissed at that incident. If you're a steelers fan and really think this was incidental stop, you're making us look like idiots."
I was not a fan of the Steelers at that time. I always saw it as intentional. I can see either side now really.
I can't believe how many people think it *wasn't* intentional.
"This sub may as well just be a pro Tomlin/Steelers propaganda outlet. It’s just embarrassing at this point.

He literally smiled after he did it"
How is it not intentional? I don’t even think he ever denied it being on purpose. Silence is basically an admittance of guilt

I wish the new jerseys (that we buy as fans to wear) fit better like the old ones. My current jerseys make it hard to lift my arms up the sleeves are so tight."
it's a great jersey i have a black bettis Jersey

Wasn't that just a few weeks ago?
I distinctly remember a few comments here wanting us to sign Matt Patricia a few years back. That one is so much worse
"The ""fire Tomlin"" crowd usually looks pretty foolish in retrospect.  They live play to play and series to series."
">~~Man, remember when~~ a bunch of Steelers fans want~~ed~~ to fire Mike Tomlin ~~and replace him with Mike McCarthy~~? Doesn't that sound idiotic?

Could be said at any time."
"It sounded idiotic then, too."
It's almost like the average fan is actually an idiot and the front office of one of the NFL's most consistently successful teams might just know more about how to build a football team than they do
"seems weird to even want to trade a HC with 1 SB for a different HC with one SB, but alright"
"By “remember when”, you mean “right now”, on Facebook, right? That place is terrible."
It sounded idiotic *then*. Now it just sounds straight up asinine.
"Yeah, but Tomlin totally didn't have control of the locker room this past weekend."
I love Western PA but unfortunately we all know some of our neighbors are never going to be happy with a head coach who looks like Coach Tomlin regardless of his record.
"I use to be fairly active in the Steelers Facebook community and there have been a big group of fire Tomlin people there for years now. I will say, there's a lot more level headed people in the Reddit community. From my experience at least."
It sounded equally idiotic then.  Anyone who couldn’t see it was woefully short sighted or guided completely by emotions.
It always sounded idiotic
"It sounded idiotic then, too"
"Never heard these discussions, but whoever said it- you are a dumbass"
Same people who said the Steelers should start Batch even when Ben was healthy.
"Well, no one has ever accused the yinzers of being bright...crazy and loyal, yes...but not bright"
Who ever said that?  I just cried for years to get rid of Todd Haley.
Love Tomlin. I’ve always defended him and will be glad that he’ll retire with us (in infinity years cause I don’t want him to leave)
"Just wait for one bad half of football, and they’ll be prominently vocal."
"Those weren’t Steelers fans. Those were haters posing as Steelers fan. No real Steelers fan is going to want to fire a coach that led us to the best record in football in the 2010s outside of the patriots, never had a losing season, and got us to 2 Super Bowls and 6 division titles. I mean he’s been with the same team for 13 years and has NEVER had a losing record. Are they 5 coaches in the history of the league that can boast that stat?"
It sounded idiotic then.
The good thing is Rooney isn't Jones. And thank the football gods he aint
"I love Tomlin, but someone please take away his challenge flag."
"I'm a fan of Tomlin and think he's a great coach, but c'mon, it's three games into the season and we've played nobody yet.

Tomlin has issues and people pretending he doesn't are just being willfully ignorant.  Steelers fans tend to either love or hate their teams, very few are objective and willing to see both the good and bad of situations in an unbiased way.  I think the thing that bugs me the most are the big game gaffes that hurt the team's chances when they matter the most, like killing clock to score a TD with only seconds left, or MANY instances where the challenge flag shouldn't have been thrown, or the losing his locker room at times, or the overlooking this week's opponents, or the decisions to go for it on 4th when two scores are needed and time is running out.  Tomlin's been fortunate in that he's coached a great team under great owners/staff and he's been very lucky in that regard."
I never wanted McCarthy but I do think Tomlin tightened it up the past two seasons. In 2018 and the few years prior he seemed to be much more passive and on the verge of losing the locker room. Last year and this year he has been on point and rock solid.
"I actually give Art Rooney II a lot of credit.  He was under a lot of pressure to make a change, but he instead made Tomlin get a bunch of staff help and it's showing up on the field with more sophisticated schemes and better preparedness.  No one ever really questioned Tomlin's club house chops although he started to go a bit soft during the AB/Lev Bell days, but he was indeed getting badly outcoached for a couple seasons there.  And I don't think anyone really wanted McCarthy in any serious way.  Steelers always go for the young unknown guy when they do decide to make a change and never pay big $$ for coaching."
"We’ve literally played three winless teams while the Cowboys have played the 3-1 Rams, 4-0 Seahawks, and 3-1 Browns. Comparison isn’t really apples to apples here."

Watching field goal practice pre-game.  Keisel jersey on....he came by and gave it to me.
BK! Fear the beard! Nice yo!
"Is it weird that he gave OP only one shoe, or is that just me?

I can only picture him hobbling away with one shoe on now"
What’s in the crown royal bag?? Dope shoe btw.

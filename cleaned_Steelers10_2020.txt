610 top posts on that sub were about us yesterday but thats the unbeaten bullseye for ya
this is honestly the game i am most worried about lets hope we dont play down to their level and just dominate them from start to finish
tomlin has a long career ahead

yinzers and racists nervously watching
the antitomlin gang is in shambles rn
but he doesnt prepare his team and cant make adjustments
the patriots are hot garbage without their qb does that make tomlin the best coach in the league dont say andy reid we know his history before pat mahomes

still waiting for the new episode

cant wait to see who he brings on his show this week i love these

the standard for shirts is the standard obviously
looks great but it needs aviators
idk i dont see mike t when i look at that
i have that shirt also one of then greats
i like it

today i just have on a black sweatshirt and i happened to spill a dab of mustard on it this morning thatll have to do for today since my steelers hoodie is in the laundry hamper
i dont like to paint with a broad brush but in general terms i really like that shirt
i wear my steelers gear with pride in md when i moved here i was surprised at the number of steelers fans im only 45 minutes from baltimore
we respect the tshirt but dont fear it
add the aviators and post a link to sell in this sub you will get a lot of orders
i was rocking my color rush juju jersey around hunt valley actually saw someone else in a 19 too
i live in gambrills and wear my steelers gear daily a lot of western pa transplants here
whered you get that that shirt is dope
thats a great shirt needs a cart and things of that nature
thats great i am in my second steelers pull over of the week today as well
was 1978 hulk hogan a steeler fan
fellow md steeler fan here im working from home so i have to smack talk over microsoft teams
heres a man who doesnt drive carts
you clearly dont live in your fears and things of that nature
i doubt anyone outside of steelers fans will know whats on your shirt though
i need this shirt whered you get it
there was a play late in the game where ben made a few audibles and the wrs on the right side of the field had no clue what the play was it ended up being a completion to the left side

if im remembering right romo made a joke that went along the lines of paraphrasing

wrs whats the play whats the play

ben doesnt matter hut hut
it was obvious too because the receivers on the right side just didnt move at the snap
that was pretty much what he said
would have been hilarious if thats what he said
i wasnt able to find the clip youre asking for but i did find a compilation video of bens presnap cadences which i thought was interesting to watch
please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this weeks opponent including weaknesses strengths or info on lesserknown players you think will have an impact

if you are a fan of the opposing team feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above andor ask us about the steelers
so dallas doesnt have a punter this week
being undefeated 70 is the first in a lifetime for me as a fan and pittsburgh native its amazing in fact but i hope that we lose a game or two before the season ends i dont want to be 160 in the playoffs solely due to superstition and national expectations that gets to players heads and egos this is gonna be such an unpopular opinion but i think we need a loss or two none in our division pls to make it mentally throughout the season and post season peace and love here we go lets get it stillers
removed
dallas is terrible so i expect this to come down to the wire getting van der esch back was a big lift for their d too
this is going to be one of those games im more terrified about us losing than last weeks
looks like we are going to be facing off against the orlando apollos 2019 starting qb garrett gilbert this weekend boys if we lose to him or cooper rush idk if we deserve to be in the playoffs lol
yall dont understand we are truly awful ben may throw for 7 tds invest in juju and claypool stock now
im not worried about our run defense i think 265 yards was a result of the gameplan being that way and losing several key run stoppers i think we can stop zeke with the way that o line has been playing

regardless of the starting qb i think we blitz the hell out of them and make that pocket collapse easily their wrs will be a tough matchup considering gallup amari and even have all been good but if we blitz well enough i think our secondary can cover htem well enough

cowboys defense was really good against the eagles i dont know how much of that is just them playing well vs wentz giving up so many turnovers but i think ben will put up good stats against them the dallas run d is abyssmal though so i hope we use our running backs against them well enough
steelers ready should win this by at least two scores
i want so badly to be lured into the false sense of security that this game will be easy but i havent forgotten how mike robbed us of our 7th super bowl
im concerned that were gonna be missing 2 starting dlinemen against a good rb and a potentially run heavy offense after our d struggled to stop the run sunday

also the ole song and dance about playing down to bad opponents
its going to be a close game weve had a few tough physical emotional wins in a row not to mention a several significant injuries going into this game its only natural for the team to let down a little bit but i still think we have too much talent for dallas to handle in their current state

2117 steelers
i started watching the nfl in 2018 and having watched this steelers team through the 2020 season i finally found the team to root for every week in the afc go steelers
i know there are a lot of jokes about pittsburgh playing down to their competition but i really think dallas is going to get blown out of the water in this one

who do yall think will be the biggest play makers for the steelers this week im thinking conner will have a pretty good game considering how bad our run defense is they had arguably their best game against the eagles doesnt say much i know but the steelers offense will be a bigger challenge should i even mention the cliff the cowboys offense has fallen off of
do not underestimate our ability to steeler we almost did it against philly cant imagine we dont do it here
congratulations on the easy win this week steelers fans please try not to hurt anyone and lets have some fun

we might get a little wild with the play calling on offense which could be entertaining to watch
first off you guys are hilarious thinking this is some trap game

your defense is going up against a 3rd string lt 2nd string 4th round pick c and 2nd string rookie free agent rt and a defense up until playing carson wentz last week that was on pace to be one of the most historically awful defenses of all time

also ive been following the steelers a lot this year because of claypool he is from around where im from and my mom is good friends with his grandma lol i remember watching notre dame games when he was a freshman excited to see him making special teams tackles dude is a special teams beast so its very exciting to see him doing well hes an extremely good kid and easy to cheer for
lets hope we are all healthy i hate seeing people get injured and it hurts even worse when its a meaningless smackdown
were playing a patchwork offense and awful defense and a high school qb steelers gonna win 1714 and itll be miserable to watch
cowboys are thinking of brining up a practice squad qb to play
i dunno i mean this might be the year that the steelers dont actually do much steelering at all

yknow
woooo fucking hoo for a 4pm game in korea i have been waking up at 2am all season to watch the early games thank god for some later games
so are we gonna see gucci dinucci or the red rocket

dallas fan here

taking bets on how many snaps before you guys ko another one of my qbs

also because of the steelers play down to their opponents and dallas needlessly over performs fears i expect us to still lose but some how cling to a tight game as if jerry is forcing torture upon the fan base by threatening the organic tanking that this season has turned into

few things of note

andy dalton is likely to be back dont count on seeing ben da hoochie dinucci haha im in danger ben dinucci

we have zack martin unlike your name is ezekiel elliott every run play will likely be behind zack martin want to counter the run nullify where ever zack is at

terrence steele is still our right tackle line up the biggest meanest dawg you got on his side and youll get 4 to 8 sacks

dalton cannot scramble please dont break him we will be left with garrett gilbert or ben da booty dinucci if you do

amari disappointed last game he may light it up this game be aware of that

tony pollard will be our best rb because something is off with zeke need to set edges with him hes very good in space he will absolutely fuck something up on a special teams play though just wait

defense what defense we dont have a defense

trevon diggs has around 7 dropped picks and 2 full picks be aware that he is playing the ball a lot and may break out

with that said since diggs is ball hunting he looks back early enough that he slows up and this allows receivers to pull away keep that in mind on deep routes

be like every other team weve faced and run away from dlaws side youll get rushing yards a result he may not get sacks but he is a monster in stopping the run

the xfactor randy gregory looked decent its not like the eagles oline was a test of anything prolific but he looked decent for finally getting more than 6 snaps aldon smith is probably hurt but those two have something to prove and they may play up to the challenge

sean lee is playing
simple we go in trying to actually win this game from the start then we win easily do simple things like wrapup dont fumble stay on your assignments on defense and this is an easy w

this scream trap game but at the same time i feel this team is different this year and they arent taking anything for granted
cowboys fan here dinucci is starting please just keep our guys healthy and i wish the same for yall as well best case scenario is both teams come out healthy after this weekend you guys will absolutely slaughter us and i dont think we will score a point apart from a field goal so health is the only win im hopeful of for us this weekend
to the players all the players both teams
would it be terrible to ask the football gods to get ahead early and let our starters rest
please use this thread to post any trash talk about next weeks opponent some people from their sub may come here to do the same so please

do not downvote visitors for using this post correctly its a trash talk thread
i mean what can i really say here go ahead and call the coroner this is going to be a murder scene
i dont like the steelers thats all i gotalso im kinda lying your defense is fun to watch
how is it that a team can be so bad that i actually feel bad trash talking them
im not saying anything because well bad juju lol
cant wait to turn this game off at halftime too
mike mccarthy is very not good at coaching
how does one trash that which is already trash
if our unbeaten streak ends this week i will eat a can of beets
whats the matter cowboys cant handle my garbage mouth
who do you think is more scared dalton on the prospect of getting healthy in time to face the defense that has had his number since he entered the league or the kid who went to pine richland and is probably all too familiar with what happens to rookies who face our defense
congrats on the 80 record
prayers for dinucci hes going to need them
dont fuck up our tank were getting a top3 pick goddammit
can we just replay the 2016 cowboys vs steelers game instead
im not even going to talk its kinda sad
jason garrett has been more impressive than mike mccarthy
your quarterbacks resume is former backup to nathan peterman lost his job to kenny pickett
does that also mean free talk causei never thought bb was this massive sith lord genius everyone has made him out to be i firmly believe all his success was based onugh i hate to say itbrady
can steel beams crush an actual cowboy find out live sunday
what can i say the cowboys are gonna put up absolutely zero resistance our only hope is if ben is bored due to that fact lol

in all seriousness enjoy 80
the game is still 5 days away and its already gg
cant wait for cowboys to fly all the way to pittsburgh just to kick a field goal



assuming we can get the ball down the field to get in fg position


edit nevermind cowboys are at home but point still stands
the steelers are going to have themselves a field day get the job done early pound the rock get the starters out 4th quarter
all the cowboys fans youre supposed to roast us not your own team
im jealous of your coach your front office your defense your many things

rivalry
this thread will age very poorly if the win streak ends
i love that americas team hasnt appeared in a conference championship game in 24 seasons probably 25 by the end of this one the only teams with a longer ccg drought are the

bills 26

dolphins 27

browns 27

lions 28

wft 28

bungles 31

great company to be in for americas team
nahthis is just mean at this point
cowboys might start practice squad qb cooper rush wtf is a cooper rush is it a new gatorade flavor is it a particularly gnarly section of the white water rapids on the yough river help me
ive got nothing
i mean yall are dallas were pittsburgh we hate each other but goddamn i feel kind of bad about talking trash to you guys right now



removed
no one worth listening to thinks this is going to happen
i was about to rant at you but yeah agreed if it was up to the average steelers fan we would have to skip the draft every year because we would have traded everyone away
sutton showed himself as a pretty good 2 cb option with hilton out the last two games i think we are fine on our corner depth for now
gilmore would be cool but our defense is already excellent our biggest need for depth is inside linebacker and they already addressed that you can never have too many good receivers as anyone who watched the 2017 afccg game can attest to especially with dj seemingly always being banged up
the mark maddens of the world hate him because he doesnt shut up and play football and bc he posts on social media they dont want athletes to be people just tools of entertainment

view poll
i think we get a whole lot more but im legally obligated to predict 5 every week 5
im unironically going 78 the cowboys have the most pass attempts giving our boys plenty of chances
all i know is im taking the over in conner rushing yards
i know its impossible but ill vote every time
against this dog shit ol and 3rd string udfa rookie qb from an fcs school anything below infinity is selling the steelers short
if we could get 6 sacks this game we have a very real possibility of breaking the record
i think that 1 passing offense is a result of dak absolutely playing out of his mind dinucci and dalton have not been very good and i think the cowboys havent scored any tds in the few games but i still wouldnt underrate them
this time im 5 or 6 sacks

we will let their participation in practice throughout the week guide our decision i dont want to paint with a broad brush regarding their injuries but such is life in the national football league
honestly i would just rest them against the cowboys
let buggs have more time tj and bud with rotating lbs should be plenty enough front 7 defense for sunday
what exactly is hiltons injury again

edit nvm found it shoulder injury for anyone else that couldnt remember
anything can happen in the nfl but i think it would be smart to maybe sit heyward no matter what this week get him healthy for the 2nd half of the year im not underestimating the cowboys however i feel confident we can win without him
id rather take a loss to rhe cowboys than lose heyward or alualu to a serious injury
rest them

this is an easy out for tomlin he probably needs a few weeks to learn the defense before he can even be considered to start and with spillane becoming a fan favorite theres no benefit to saying anything otherwise right now let him learn the playbook and ease himself in i see him starting within 4 weeks
wonder how bad gilbert is hurt
43 look will expand guaranteed
all i know about williamson is he is currently an 83 overall in madden it would be amazing if he was actually that good in real nfl games
bro im ready to watch this defense crank it the fuck up in honor of d bush
will fitzpatrick get the backup green dot
hopefully he can get some quality snaps with the defense against dallas to get into the mix

power rankings dont really matter it doesnt diminish how great weve been as a team

with that being said i would definitely not fault someone for putting the chiefs above us both teams id say are neck and neck for number one
we dont care about power rankings and things of that nature
dude we could beat the in their prime 72 dolphins prime 07 pats and prime 85 bears all in back to back weeks and they would still say we havent played anyone good lmao
1 who cares about power rankings

2 the chiefs are fucking scary dudethem being number 1 is not surprising at all
you realize that power rankings are about more than record and schedule right even as a steelers fan i wouldnt put money on us if we were playing them tomorrow
for the millionth time it do not matter
the steelers have a better record but the chiefs are the better team plain and simple imo when they win they dominate theyve got the best point differential in the nfl its definitely no sleight to the steelers to be 2 to the reigning super bowl champs itll be a good game if they meet in the playoffs
they are the defending super bowl champs
i have said this in other conversation but i want to be undefeated and underrated the chiefs are an excellent team let them have the 1 power ranking target on their back as long as possible
to be the best you gotta beat the best they are super bowl champs they get the nod
chiefs are 71 as defending champs with no major injuries returning almost their full roster they are number 1 until theres a 2 game difference as far as im concerned
beating the jets was so much more of an accomplishment than beating the ravens on the road s


this is almost meaningless it can take over a week for someone whos infected to actually show positive on a test thats how these positives keep sneaking in despite daily testing of players
isnt the incubation period something like 214 days though
geezits almost as if wearing masks and social distancing workswhod a thunk it
i might be wrong but i swear that humphrey was listed as questionable with an illness before the game
this means nothing the tests were done yesterday not even 24hrs after the game
good news is theres been no evidence of on field transmissions

what do ya mean youre worried about me

table full of empty ic light cans

yep i related to that one
well you know the suns been on the decline only got about 5 billion good years left lets talk when they play a black hole

fuck too real beat the ravens at home coming off a bye with a lackluster performance bens got a 5 td 300 yard game coming still this season have they never seen this team this is us heating up and stumbling along the way november is here winter is coming the kings in da norf have reclaimed their crown just got to shine it up a bit
that ending fucking perfect
this was the best one yet
always hilarious
his content is good i just wish he had a better accent my fake pittsburgh accent is better than his real pittsburgh accent


seems like a bit much but ok nfl
didnt deangelo williams get one of these fines for most of the season when he kept wearing the pink cleats or something these small fines are just an eyesore when it becomes news
so dumb meanwhile melvin gordon from denver could still play after getting a dui
great another off the field problem by juju smith schuester s
your stockings failed to cover your lower leg

what is this victorian england will he get find because his corset isnt tight enough next
the picture showed has titans players in the background not wearing socks correctly
theres someone who works for the nfl who has the job of making sure people are wearing the correct socks imagine having that listed in your job description
were back to this shit again come on
disgusting juju is clearly affected by ab i told everyone he was a problem

mark madden probably
haha that seemsuseless
the nfl must really be hurting for revenue
record scratch the fuck


edit this was during the titans game what in the actual fuck aside from it being a rule what purpose does having your sock cover your lower leg do
why not just make the pants go below the knee rather than demand the socks be thigh high
oh greathere comes the drama s
thank god i could barely even focus on the game because of their socks s
fines are a means for the league to recoup a of salaries theyre petty as it can be
i feel this is a beyond stupid rule but in any case the titans players here should be receiving fines as well

wed like to acknowledge whats going on in our country today and encourage everyone to vote however wed also like this to serve as a reminder that we do not allow political discussion in this subreddit so please take that elsewhere
dan rooney was a huge obama guy

nonexistent who would we be sitting to play him
0 hes expensive and the steelers dont really need him
what would have to be given up
there is zero chance
gonna go on a limb and say 0 chance
hes the face of the franchise in houston and theyve flat out said everyone is available for trade except for watson and watt

so not great

nil to one in a nillion
its a fun idea but hes an expense probably lands elsewhere
0
none texans wont trade him and if they do itll be for something we wouldnt give up
roughly 0
i want maximum wattage as much as the next bro but not this year except in madden
we would be giving up valuable players only for him to get injured and sit out fir half a season no thanks
jj watt is almost literally an institution in houston that city would revolt if he were traded away
the same as percentage chance that you looked at his contract
maybe at the end of his career the bros will team up but not likely
i get it it would be a lot to give up for an injury prone rental but i hear hes on the block
i got terrible towel i live in different time zone so i can watch only 1 pm games and i became fan after the ravens game so who to hate what players are good and how do we going do defeat the chiefs
respecthate the ravens hate the browns feel bad for the bengals literally all of our players are likeable and our coach is great
borat has entered the sub
i literally shuddered at horrible towel
are you new cause we are undefeated personally speaking i dont want no bandwagon fans
jesse james caught it
im a steelers fan too and im a fan of you i hope we make it too the super bowl plz pray for the steelers we is good we is 43 my uncle likes the cowboys we call them cowgirls bc they girls tj watt did some good defense and the cowgirls do to cowgirls we comeing back for you heheheheeh

i dont think so far just a week at a time

but if we get past the ravens and bills i can see a run at it

more than anything give me the 1 seed and force kc to a round 1 game
i highly doubt it some incredible teams havent managed to go 160 even ones that had soft schedules between four divisional games having more road games than home games and every teams potential to lay a stinker i just dont see them going 160

i do expect them to be favored in every remaining game though barring some sort of catastrophic injury
rather win super bowls if we have the 1 seed locked up sit some people roll into the playoffs healthy and hungry
if we can beat the ravens again and the bills i say yes i could see us resting our starters week 17 if we have it all locked up though
i dont think 160 for a few reasons we have a few tough games we always drop a dud game but lets say we are suddenly 110 or 120 were going to rest starters the last week or two especially with that super early bye week

now you want the undefeated with a lot of starters getting rest against a super spiteful browns team in week 17 well mason vs garrett rematch would get all the headlines at least
i cant see past lunch
this is why i wanted to lose sundaytoo much juju building up and now a loss looks bad i had us losing sunday and then to one of the jagsbills and thats it
lets just win this week and figure the rest out when its time

i dont know shit about fuck about dinucci but i do know dinucci is in trouble
man this sucks i was kinda looking forward to the boys terrorizing dalton again for old times sake
inb4 dinucci the goochie is joe montana
im going to hammer the shit out of cowboys money line
hopefully im wrong but this seems like a huge trap game on the road against a 3rd stringer while 70
weve had some trouble with midgame replacement at qb but when we can gamelan for the backup i feel sorry for dinucci
dinucci isnt playing


youre 18 hours late
damnit must

rip ben dinucci

in other words could be a long sunday afternoon for dinucci
boy this guy better not choose this week to turn into dan marino all the sudden
do we really only have 30 sacks guess were slacking this year
we all know this will randomly be his best game of his career and will put in a great effort steelers will escape the trap game 2117
apparently practice squad qb cooper rush may get the start
were going to break the record for most sacks in a season and most consecutive seasons leading the league in sacks
we should come away with 6 sacks but i guess we will see lol
im in danger meme
if i know anything about the steelers last few years this means hell be channeling joe montana sunday
dinucci after the 1st series of downs sunday
tell dinucci to get ready for a nice big helping of gabagool



tyson is out any word if were gonna be cautious with cam or is he on pace to play
i just dont feel the trap game vines this year these vibes started to come at the aging defensive years and when we relied heavily on our offense this team is balanced and has shown that it can win even if one side doesnt show up for a half

this game is shaping up to be closer than expected at first but domination in the second half
surprised teams are not trying to trade for duck i know he is not great but he won what 4 games for us last year

if i was a gm with a bad qb situation right now id be trying to make a deal for him

lmao the cowboys are so scared to play him against us they are considering cooper rush instead
except theyre not playing him

mccarthy okay andy lets start prepping for this steelers defense

andy on speaker phone cant coach covid19 bye

mccarthy alright dinucci then its to you

dinucci youre fucking with me right i dont wanna die

mccarthy okay then who do got on the practice squad cooper rush sounds more like a running back name but whatever

rush you must truly be desperate to turn to me for help
wait dalton had a concussion and now he had covid wtf
all i know is this means stress free 4th quarter for us this weekend right

i dont have to have my doctor on speed dial right
im having mike glennon tampa bay nightmares
i watched some cooper rush film and he was destroying his competition

edit turns out it was a middle school football game but yeah he really did a number on those 6th graders
thought dalton would be out with a concussion anyway
thats like switching warm underwear with your brother because you need to change them lol
and now dallas has me worried at least we knew dinucci sucks and had 15 games worth of tape to figure out how exactly he sucks rush doesnt have a single nfl snap since 2017 so we have no idea how to prepare for him
just put out the tackling dummy same score
fuck i really hope we get dinucci
oh were about to eat eat

living in texas i had my sights on this since the schedule came out had every intention on attending but covid is a bitch seeing how both teams are trending im incredibly disappointed
thinking they are benching dinucci
bringing in cooper rush
3 years
5 games
3 passes
1 completion
2 yds
422 rating
i wouldnt mind seeing a mason rudolph vs ben dinucci showdown in the second half
im excited but i also remember how jeff driskel looked against us
i love this guy in my head i can hear him saying hale yeah something like that
the thing is in my fantasy i have big ben dinucci and the steelers defense
i was actually lookingn forward to seeing a game against dalton plauing for a different team i have some solid respect for dalton
i went to high school with him hes gonna have a bad day sorry bud
two guys competing for the 4th string spot
so if everything goes as planned and we end up undefeated or go 133 and mike tomlin wins hc if the year does mike tomlin have a better case as an all time great head coach especially with how he hasnt had 1 losing season despite having a star qb out bill belichick looks like hes about to have a losing season without tim brady and brady is carrying the bucs so does mike t deserve alot more credit then what he gets
hes already punched his ticket to the hall of fame he has his credit in spades and hes only 48 just sit back and enjoy the rest of the ride
if coach cowher made it to the hall of fame then tomlin 100 will
tomlin is a great coach we know it who cares what the rest of the world thinks
everyone except the yinzer faction knows hes an all time great
the steelers ownership has had 3 coaches in a row win super bowls in the last 50 years two are in the hall the third has a great shot at the hall with more to unfold

call me about dynasty when kraft gets that done
tomlin does not need a better case as an all time great head coach the book on that issue was closed and filed on a shelf in canton long ago
yes
idk what do you think
i have a close friend cowboys fan who thinks tomlin is average at best and underperformed with ab and lev bell while i feel like we shouldve won at least 1 sb with them it irks me so bad that tomlin doesnt get the credit he deserves you can count on one hand the number of coaches that win 8 games with rudolph and duck
needs a couple more sb wins and need to see how he does post ben era

right after this play in the game thread like 25 of us said bush would have made that tackle probably could have taken a little better angle but yeah thats about all you can ask for from spillane
angle speed hell learn

avery isnt any faster than spillane you are gonna hope with 3 more games of experience spillane gets better anticipation a smidge quicker on the reaction and that quarter to half a step cuts that play before the corner is turned
this was on watt

he lost the edge and no ilb in the league is going to make up that difference watt went in and had no help outside he lost the edge and the rb bounced it out with no contain or being slowed at all

i think this is just really bad analysis
well guess what bush isnt making that tackle either because players rarely regain the speed they once had post a major knee injury so either we draft a new ilb or this is what we have to work with

if the steelers win this game by 50 chiefs will still be number 1
i feel like this only increases the chance for steelering
fuck i really wanted to play dinucci
i do not appreciate the dinucci slander
so they are actually tanking lol imagine battling another backup to start against a defense this vicious


you guys remember when we beat the ravens that was awesome
for some reason this made me imagine a president tomlin in the white house press briefing room fielding difficult questions on a variety of critical issues but answering in tomlinisms i cant stop laughing at that on climate change its hot in the kitchen on coronavirus we respect it but we dont fear it this could go on
losing never heard of her
losing happens all the time in life















unless youre the most badass team in the nfl lets fucking gooooooooo
im 99 sure this guy is on the sub
teams really out here losing bruh
ive stared at this for hours its so beautiful
president tomlin how will you respond to rumors that china is expanding into the south sea

you know im not gonna speculate or give any sound bites that they can use thats just low hanging fruit all i know is that ive got a meeting with france on friday and thats what im preparing for
love this
hes a great follow on twitter
this is the best thing ive seen on the internet today literally lold
sing it brother
love kevin his twitter is hysterical
i think this is something we can all agree on and i love it
politics is all just one big ass blast



its funny that these guys call out guys like mad for breaking a window but are totally silent when a cop fucking kills someone and didnt have to

one of these things is not like the other
truer words have never been spokenespecially that last sentence
yes
today
meh people riot when their team wins too

win or lose act like youve been there before
ahhhh ahahaha so much truths in one post
best meme ive seen all day
hahah kevin will be happy to know hes viral on his third platform with this tweet hes the biggest steelers fan i know yinz give him a follow
last week was a close one
fucking based
posted a screenshot on my ig and someone actually told me its offensive and insensitive how insanely soft are people becoming
this guy is a tool bag to the tenth degree he gives aditi crap all the time about being abs baby momma on twitter and hes extremely rude to brooke pryor as well oh and hes a covid truther so theres that
this aged poorly
coming off big games with high emotions the past two weeks against a team we should beat easily this smells like a trap to me

i think a w against dallas says as much and possibly even more about their focus and commitment than the balt game steelers have injuries and every excuse to look past dallas i hope they dont but this game will tell me a lot about being real contenders
i think the trap game is cinci and i still dont think we will lose
nah
if they cant beat cooper rush or garrett gilbert then they dont deserve to be 80 much less contenders one week at a time no one gets over looked tomlin will have them ready

if anyone knows what a trap smells like it would be you
itll be closer than everyone expects well play down as usual but we wont lose
this was posted a day ago i swear you guys want us to lose just so you can say i told you so
why would it be a trap game when its at the start of a run against three teams with five combined wins who is it were supposed to be looking past these teams toward indy on the last weekend of the calendar year
pretty scary game haha
i know everybody downplays these games and everybody that raises concern is not a true fan but i do worry about overconfidence and ive watched powerful steelers teams over the years lose to abominations of teams like the jets soooooo i wont feel comfortable until the whistle blows and a w is hung in the column
cinci is the potential trap game burrows is good
this is a perfect storm for our d

most sacks in a game 12 steelers v cowboys 112066 it would be fitting to break this record against them and get 7 sbs in the same year
really this year the year with offensive holding penalties being called 40some less

x200b

i like your faith but nah lets shoot for 5 and improve from there
we could destroy the cowboys and get 15 sacks pundits still would say kc just feels like a better team they have mahomes
7 super bowls in 1 year seems unlikely

according to the farmers almanac the new decade doesnt start until 2021

but theyre probably cowboys fans

2021 is the start of the decade 110 1120 2130 etc theres a famous jeopardy moment where all 3 contestants got the answer wrong in regards to when a new decade actually starts
so it is a good thing that they didnt get to last year playoff
well more accurately undefeated in the 20s
decade doesnt start till jan

ive seen some awesome stillers flair the last couple weeks show us what you got
i tend to change mine to send love to hurt players so im still rocking mike hilton right now
69
home state hero so excited when we drafted him and the packers passed on him
im never changing mine
my favorite offensive player of all time on the steelers
stupid question but how does one add flair
mapletron
gotta give some love to the backup
mine is in honor of my favorite and most legitimate jersey i currently own a minkah color rush

i normally just get ones from dhgate but the color rush ones are noticeably differentlower quality

some pretty big fucking names on this list spillane has some work to do but man hes got fight in him
man donnie shell was amazing take a minute and watch him drop earl campbell


nice work
ill always have a soft spot for willie
hilton was also udfa i believe
if youre using the app click for full image with text
great post some real beasts
man every time i see willie parker on the internet im like damn i miss that guys speed if only he had the knee genetics of adrian peterson
the real number 84
glad you included jack butler very underrated defensive back
ummm duck
donnie shell the headhunter
i sure do miss deebo
does anyone else think randy grossman look like scott bakula from necessary roughness or is it just me

i love cl
did you pull that
nice card
nice card

i once pulled an autographed barry sanders laserview card then i traded it for a bunch of pack and other decent cards then i lost them
you lucky son of a bitch
wow that card is sick congrats

finally someone who lifts weights
so my boss today we live in jax so shes a big jags fan told me how awesome haden is she went to uf and worked in someway with the sports department while she went there she said 90 of the athletes she met were pretty douchey and didnt treat her that well but she said she has followed haden all through his browns and steelers career because he was such a genuinely great guy i of course initially geeked out that she knew joe haden and then was very happy to hear my opinion of him being a great overall dude vindicated
joe seems really friendly
joe is such a humble sweet dude seems like you could kick back beers with him as if youve know each other for years
hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard

i cannot emphasize how very very true this is in so many parts of life the absolute best is when you have both but yeah ive seen folks who should have so much talent but dont apply it and dont make anything of it talent is honed by practice practice is work

fucking love that story
youre goddamn right
legendary
i fucking love love this great team great franchise and great family
did anyone actually think the steelers were americas team
like this column im lucky enough to still have the steelers available to pick this week its a nobrainer vs dallas but im wondering if i should hold onto them they play cincy and jax next who s everyone going with this week


im going steelers ill worry about next week next week
pats junk team but playing a team openly trying to lose perfect spot for them
i got kansas city used the steelers week 1 only six people left in my survivor pool trying to close it out hopefully
id say its better to pick us this week against dallas than next week against the bengals weird things happen in our division sometimes
definitely taking a guaranteed w against dinucci
if you havent used the cardinals then this is the week to do so

save the steelers for the jax game
id take green bay this week kittles out jimmy g is likely out i know its a thursday night road game but i dont see green bay losing with how hurt sf is
i already used pittsburg dont trust ne because they burned me in a different survivor league not sure who to take though i dont want to use the chiefs unless i have to


the yinzers are gonna have to decide this election arent they
tomlin should run after hes done coaching

is he suppose to be legit or just someone we added for depth
i thought he couldnt play with the team for two weeks because of the covid protocol
based

im on mobile can someone just comment it
oh my
someone is not gonna be happy about that
dude is gonna lose his job
thisthis cant be real
this is amazing how the hell did you find this op



in the first half it seemed like our gameplan against their blitzes was to just go five wide and either check it down or take a sack but when ben started calling the shots in the second half they couldnt do anything to stop us
i dont usually like laying big numbers but this one seems like
a lay up can anyone try to justify grabbing the 135 and taking the cowboys
no they have a bad habit of playing to their competition im confident that they will win but i could see them playing sloppy and letting it get closer than it should be
im not going to touch that game in my head the steelers should be able to win this game 3413 or something like that but 135 smells like a back door cover to me when the steelers take their foot off the gas at the end something like the steelers being up 3113 with 5 minutes left in the game and then dallas dinks and dunks its way for a final td

no need for me to give myself that heartburn when i can just hammer that over 415
trap game take the boys to cover
i think you could take the steelers to cover if dalton was playing id say differently but theyve got an absolute garbage offensive line and playing a literal 4th or 5th string qb and their defense is maybe the worst in the nfl even if ben plays down its hard not to see the steelers demolishing them
doesnt look like a line id be eager to bet one way or the other
3rd string qb shitty offensive line bust of a rb who cant rush for 50 yards against a bad defense subpar defense the steelers will find a way to make it close
i find it hard to imagine a scenario where the cowboys offense isnt rendered ineffective by our d line
any 10 point spread is gonna be tough to cover such is life in the national football league
no after the steelers and ravens play each other neither team covers typically
the over under on this game is 42 im going to be pittsburgh and the over because i think if dallas covers it has to be over 42 i think im betting double with very lithe risk of losing both
they have injuries across the entire defensive line and are going up against a team with a 3rd string qb and zeke elliotgonna give up some rushing yards
steelers have covered 6x this year other than denver nfl pickwatch early consensus is steelers cover espn pickcenter is split between number fire and team rankings

i myself find it too stressful to bet on the steelers other than my annual preseason bet they win the super bowl
this week will go down just like the last two games or like the cleveland game nothing in between
steelers highly likely to cover whatever the spread is be bold i would also place a few units on some props too

coach tomlin has this team laser focused nothing like years in the past the locker room is strong closeknit and full of young talent who all want to win games and dont worry about stats totally different from years past
i wouldnt touch 2 tds with a ten foot pole should they win 3713 yes but what will probably happen is up 2710 the cowboys score a garbage td at the 2 minute warning
no way do i bet on the steelers in this game classic trap game the steelers fall into

can we get the quote hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard somewhere pinned
this is more important than the election
every year is like hitting the lottery

the instructions on how to order are in a post on the fb page
nice i will be making my donation friday when i get paid broke af right now
sounds like mr claypool has a nice mom working for a good cause
not a fb usercan someone post the link here
awesome im in canada going to order a few
someone should show dababy this he just lost his brother to suicide
thanks for the heads up im ordering some too
i remember when we were going to get a bunch of steelers mask in our store and then they all got recalled because of no licensing agreement hopefully they dont go after her
can someone link pictures i dont have access to my facebook bc zucc sucks at customer service
awesome as a canadian i feel like i have to at least buy a couple

tuitt when healthy is our best defensive lineman thats not a slight at cam in any way i fucking love that man its just a testament to how good tuitt is
dude is making a quiet but solid case for that comeback player of the year
lemme tell yall something

he is playing even better than he was last year and that says a whole hell of a lot

we have two legitimate cpoy candidates between he and benjamin
tuitt is a fucking monster on the field so i always find it so funny watching him off the field and doing shit like his rib cookout he has such a soft voice for such a hulk of a man well deserved though he showed up big against baltimore
he definitely flies under the radar behind all the warranted hype of cam tj dupree and even tyson but he is an absolute monster when healthy

it is unreal that all these players are as dominant as they are stairwayto7
do it
its a good year to be a notre dame fan and a steelers fan
one of the best parts of watching all22 footage is seeing tuitt just bull rush his lineman and push him straight back into the qb sometimes its like varsity vs jv these poor linemen just getting manhandled
imagine have 6 sacks as a 34 dend at the halfway point of a season fucking insane this man better be in the conversation for dpoy
mans a dog but he wasnt even defensive player of his team
comeback poy
this lers defense is on a new level
nice to have a solid steelers defense again
draft positions across the first level

dupree 1 22

heyward 1 31

alualu 1 10

tuitt 2 46

watt 1 30

assume that this is based on getting back injured players who have a good chance to return this year ie the steelers get back guys like heyward and alualu but not bush and remove upcoming schedules playoff seeding and other things from the picture these five teams are getting healthy and going into some sort of neutral field competition that is going to render one team the best who ya got

view poll
you are what your record says you are
i genuinely think the steelers have the most talent the problem is consistency particularly for the offense i mean look at the two halves of the titans game that first half looked like the absolute best team in football the second half didnt and again for the ravens the offense basically didnt exist in the first half

you compare that to a team like the chiefs or tampa bay who have great defenses and seem to show up on offense every single week

the next few games will be a good test of this cowboys bengals jags are some of the worst defenses out there lets see if the offense can take advantage
i will say the chiefs do i think we have a shot at beating them absolutely but i do think that having the best qb in the league and a defense outside of the lv game that has been playing well is impressive
id say the chiefs tbh they dropped a game to a divisional rival but honestly its only a matter of time until we lose too they just happened to lose earlier in the season than us that mahomes led offense just doesnt get slowed down by any defense if they have a down game its because they showed up flat im just not confident in them happening to show up flat if we meet them in the h2h

but really its a 5050 between us and kc we have 1 less loss they have more dominant wins and the head to head matchup is simply too close to even predict so either us or them
we need the offense to be consistent nowadays defense gets you to the superbowl but it wont win you the game cant have the offense look as bad as they did in the second half of the tits game and the first half of the ravens game in the superbowl
show me the results coming in 3rd is quite a surprise i thought the seahawks would be in front of them for sure
if we have learned anything from the past 20 years its not who is the best team rather who gets a 1st round bye and cheats jk not really but jk if we get a 1st round bye bc of our record we are in a better position to be the better team most times thats all that matters and when it doesnt call belichick for a tip i heard he might be free this post season
i think its hard to argue that its not kc their offense is damn scary and their defense is overlooked our guys have to be in that conversation kinda just flipped from them they are probably 1a while we are 1b after them you look at the bucs they are just as complete a team but for some reason we still doubt them i think seahawks ravens both have some serious flaws that can hold them back but in the areas they excel they are damn good im not a believer in no for whatever reason
before the season i said 142 1 seed and sb champion steelers have done nothing but justify my analysis and in this hypothetical injuries arent an issue

meanwhile every other team has stumbled and shown warts

chiefs are very overrated in this forum again they werent a dominant champion they were a 124 team with some stumbles and some struggles they deserved to win but got there only because of a hot second half and some monumental mistakes by the opponent in the sb on a 1to10 scale of sb champs they were a 4 or a 5 just soso

tom brady is always overvalued here its hard to circle jerk lamar jackson the week after we dominated him again so fake fans in this sub fall back on old and predictable thought patterns
i wanted to include one more option but the poll wouldnt let me so im going to try a little work around here upvote this comment if you think new orleans is the best team

please dont upvote it if you already voted and please dont downvote it im just trying to get a sense to see if there are any folks that would have new orleans at the top of the pack



now thats a ballsy purchase love it
wheres you snag the hat i love that
any tips on how to iron out my flat would be greatly appreciated
but theres no post on sundays and thats how when we win

this might have been posted already but this meme is just the gift that keeps on giving

lets not do this here

i could use one of those in these trying times

the crazy thing is juju has 0

so these are all diontae ebron and a number on the running backs

gotta do a better job on those
looking at you diontae love ya to death but damn you got some butterfingers sometimes
after mongrief i feel like dropped passes arent much of an issue or a concern for us anymore they are gonna happen and a few have come from tipped balls or just bad passes and those who have dropped passes arent doing so regularly and with major issues

ebrons ball to the knee one is a great example of just a fluke dropped pass he went low to get and it impacted his knee as he was trying to go to the ground

compared to other quarterbacks who have questionable receiving rooms were solid as fuck johnson has some ball control to work on but again its nothing that cant be coached and improved
havent seen a lot of drops for a few weeks tbh
samuels probably has two along with like two catches smh
this was the same problem last year both at the beginning of the year and after the back ups came in even when they were getting it to the wrs they were dropping them and it wasnt all moncrief either
jaylen samuels gas dropped at least half of his targets so far and theyre only ever like 35 yard routes hes supposed to be the stellar pass catcher and hes having the worst season of his career

whats roger some 1920s rando holy shit her anklebone is showing skank
we dont needs posts about this every day its not even a real story
uniform violation fines arent bizarre theyre common the rules arent difficult follow them and youll be fine


avery trade looking real nice now
good thing we brought in williamson then nice to get some ol depth back also
i think this was a clear sign that avery was traded to replace ugiii and not much of a factor towards spillane i was worried his trade meant something could have been serious with ugiii but thought it was a minor injury in practice and didnt think much on it
is dotson still the starter or is the plan to slowly phase him out as we go further along the season


removed
yes
in truth no clear answer im leaning diontae but if i were to commit to that then ill jynx it and hell get hurt the first play again
jaylen samuels
its a toss up honestly
derek watt
go with dj
ppr you have to play dj over chase
standard you probably want chases upside over dj

in reality its a coin flip either way if dj stays healthy he is the clear target winner but chase only needs one play and gets involved in different ways

people forget how dominant fitz was because he doesnt put up fantasy points anymore the guy was such a beast
i dont know who don hutson was but that guy must have been a beast and that was back when passing really wasnt the meta
good ole eggs manske


damn thats awesome
i love our team
that was great thanks for sharing

rokbuddyretard
rcringe

awesome i just got the email today that mine has shipped i went with polamalu
dude so nice

my polamalu got shipped today stoked
oh shit i like that i like the salute to service line they have they make good stuff

for those that dont want to watch the whole video we won best team best coach and best rookie claypool
i still dont know if hes a steelers fan
pat is the closest thing i get to listening to drunk old timers at the dive down the street these days
whoa whoa whoa romo did not nickname chase mapletron wheres the so to steeler nation

i watched colin cowherds top 10 team vid today and when he got to us hes like baltimore out gamed and out played the steelers almost every minute of that game its like we even beat a good team and people still make excuses that we lost the game although we technically won it
historically good team shrug
they hate us cuz they aint us
seriously ive been told mahomes is the reason the steelers arent contenders
i think its better that way we luckily dont have the big egos we used to have with bell and brown but history shows we have a tendency to play to opponents level as it is we just need to stay consistent for a full game on offense
this kid my class is a chiefs fan and shits on me for liking the steelers i dont say anything and let our record talk i respect the chiefs but in that raiders game i laughed my ass off
the steelers are good they also probably are not the best team in the league theres so nuance here
as a niner fan this is exactly how we were at this point last year maybe even worse you guys really feel like the niners last yr and im rooting for u in the afc

true gents

the standard is the standard
i love this team
i legit wonder if its primantis or something else just curious about food most of the time when its brought up in little stories because quarantine life can be really freaking boring
every vote must be countedand things of that nature
my wife was already a fan this might make her a fanatic
godamnit cleveland native here but credit where credits due thats a class move

lots of election staff working hard under intense scrutiny and i can appreciate this kind of support

country over team one peoples over everything keep it up
if you hate the steelers you hate america
class act organization
what are they eating
im sure this would make art and dan proud
classiest team in football you dont hear about the eagles doing anything like that in philadelphia
i love this goddamn team
election fraud s
more of this looking out for each other less of everything else this week
good guys
hell yeah thats so cool
i just saw that on televisionwas going to post ittoo late
this is the way
jesus fucking christ anyone reading this would be good to do themselves a favor and stay the hell away from the comments on the twitter post

good lord
love my fucking team
our team is hands down the best off of the field
pittsburgh pride
just as long as they dont eat over the ballots

steelers are the best
respect from a browns fan classy and kind
aw gee whiz those selfless stillers schlepping slices to the same voters who pay for their stadium what a class act yinz are ridiculous on here dudes smdh
removed

barely can be called micd up still fun to watch
lj fort was supposed to follow him hmmmmm

what a savage glad he staying positive and enjoying himself
banner been laid up hitting them sticks

shit like this makes me proud to be a steelers fan such a class act by them and i can guarantee juju and chase had a big part in this id bet heyward zach banner and maybe even minkah had a part in this too
i was just telling my wife how lucky we are as fans to be able to root for teams with ownership like the rooneys and mario lemieux not only are the pens and steelers elite franchises in sport they are ran by truly good people that you can be proud of
nbc news said it was ownership and gave all the credit to the rooney family chuck todd is a dope
stillers should be giving out tickets for how much those voters pay for their stadium

yes they do no not

steelers do you feel in charge

ravens we paid a small fortune to beat you

steelers and you think this gives you power over us
this has i lift weights energy
they own a fluky qb who throws under 200 yards a game
they got squat
hes pretty good at pushing the ref
what shit exactly do they think they own you would think this would be the standard we must defend this house speech but that doesnt really fit with what hes saying
the ravens own the division since when
im sincerely disappointed that there wasnt a narrator saying that

heyward being full is gonna give those he was faking it whiners some fuel but nice to see him back

i dont agree with sitting him as a precaution but definitely lowering his snaps this week and getting buggs some extra reps would be beneficial going to need a more polished backup with wormley on ir for cam and alualu and its not going to be mondeaux
glad to see cam is good didnt need him missing games
nice seeing danger in full hes an unsung hero imo
cant believe the video i saw of cam practicing literal definition of a leader im glad he secured his bag and im glad we locked him up need to get me some heyward apparel at some point
hello rsteelers

here is the link for the week 9 reddit nfl picks the top 10 from this week and the link for next week will be announced on wednesday no more picks can be made after 1000 pm on saturday night good luck


hello everyone

the week 9 leaderboard is out i will post the week 10 link on tuesday or wednesday go to

to see everything
cooper rush garrett gilbert do not instill a lot of fear that being said i was at hines field week 14 december 8 2002 vs the houston texans when we lost 246 i will carry that emotional scarring with me forever 2 pick sixes and a fumble scoop score texans had 47 total yards the stillers had 422 we need to take care of the ball if we do not beat ourselves we go 80 for the first time in stillers history
report today is that ezekiel elliot is pussing out of practice hell probably half ass it on sunday too thats why the cowboys always suck under expectations theyre a bunch of soft front running bitches jerry jones does not know how to create a winning atmosphere he thinks its all about him and what he can buy who he can sweet talk who he can bully who he can blame jerry confusing himself with what jimmy johnson was able to accomplish for him is the biggest joke in the nfl
valid concern its the nfl not college level playing field salary cap etc that said it would take some monumental fluke occurrences there is a reason why 135 underdogs dont win straight up very often i expect them to cover and win by 20 but its not hard to envision a garbage td ruining them spread
yeah but we have ben at qb now and an elite defense
havent won in dallas since 2004
lost a super bowl in this stadium
head coach is guy who beat us
underperforming against shit teams in recent years
if we want to be elite and be looked and taken as super bowl contenders we have to dominate this game
glad im not the only one very worried about this game and the steelers habits of playing down to bad opponents

so does that mean that cam is playing then

edit and what about buggs
if vance got the covid from the ravens ima be pissed

damn bat eating ratbirds
on the bright side this is the perfect week for anyone to be missing as much as we suck against historically bad teams this feels beyond impossible to lose
if vance is out it means i get to see some action from my hometown dude zach gentry
ill be happy if buggs can play would really not want to see mondeaux out there full time
these are all huge guysdamn
i hope we can essentially treat this as a week we can rest our injured guys playing the nfc east is huge for us this year since we had our bye week way too early
perfectly fine with this no disrespect to the cowboys not really but we should beat them handily without these two need those two for the second half stretch so get healthy
ill be surprised if mike hilton plays



my brother said before the draft that we would take watt and i was like nah he is just a name there is no way he can be anywhere as good as his brother we wont take him

never been so happy to be wrong in my life
taco charlton
i dont know if im happier hes a steeler or that hes not a cowboy lol
i was kinda hoping wed draft an actually good corner that year but i was still satisfied with watt at the time and excited for his potential now hes an irreplaceable star on this team and a very close second place for my favorite player on the team behind minkah

can you shop a mask on there too the man has paid enough
uh oh king george iii lost in the end though if the steelers dont win the super bowl this year i blame you

no wonder they aint finished counting yet fuckers eating a whole banquet hope the other states give the counters food aswell
thats cool
superrrrr late repost
so i live like 2 miles away from att stadium in arlington tx and regardless of how their season is going cowboys fans are still talking like theyre gonna blow us out this sunday and theyre still the best team in the league i mean whats new anyway i really hope this isnt one of those trap games and we shut them up even before the first quarter ends
howdy im a pittsburgh native living in san antonio and a few of my coworkers are already trying to place nomoney bets with the cowboys victory

but you know8 0 coming
i live in baltimore trust me its not fun loving the steelers here
i live in dfw and all my coworkers are saying the cowboys are going to get worked and if its bad enough they are going to stop watching at halftime
i live in fw i havent heard a single cowboys fan that is confident heading into sunday
i feel your pain i am just down the road in fort worth i hear the same things
if any 2 fans are interested in going to the game and sitting in the boonies please pm me it is cheaper to buy tickets in packs of 4
eh look up cowboys forum on google most are saying we are gonna blow them out

yeah the diehards in person are just trying to convince themselves i dont know lol



please no let down
jujus nd claypools tik tok content are gold especially claypools hes absolutely hilarious
whos arm is that
tuitts looking real slim these days baybay
later in the day

smithschuster will be out 46 weeks with a meniscus tear that he acquired from doing ticktok dances
imaginary hacky sack
called this early in the sub huge letdown as usual

is he playing today i feel like this game would be a good warmup game for him
hes been activated and hes going to dress as an emergency backup so well get a look at him in a steelers jersey but the most strenuous thing hes likely to be doing is sipping gatorade
i doubt it barring injury maybe in a complete blowout situation

hes been virtual practicing all week and they dont really want to play someone they havent had a good look at in real practice if they can avoid it
i dont believe hes cleared covid19 protocol yet to be activated for the game he should just be on the inactive roster for the day

the recent roster cuts and moves were to make room for him but not so he could play today next week is the earliest he can actually take the field for us i believe
likely not this week ive heard a lot of next week though
from what ive heard he is a faster version of vince williams and he barely posted faster that spillane in the 40 spillane is 4 years younger and is an unknown commodity with regards to his talent ceiling avery has been competent and above avg as a run stopper kind of meh in pass coverage like vince and spillane id rather have spillane in more downs a guy who is playing with house money and has nothing to lose and everything to gain from playing well i think barring a colossal screw up by spillane that avery will be the backup for around 3 games while they try to coach avery up to play as our coverage capable ilb so long as he shows more in practice in coverage he will take the majority of defensive snaps with spillane working in as the backup

that was fun man a trip down memory lane i forgot about a lot of those names specifically the tight ends
man talk about a walk down memory lane kimo von oelhoffen i feel old
in that 2004 season the cowboys went 610 it was part of six year stretch from 20002005 where they had a losing season four times and only made the playoffs once until romo came along

in case anyone was wondering whether the nailbiter win over a bad team was new under tomlin or if its simply how all professional sports play out the occasional game with a blowout like the steelers and browns game a couple weeks ago does not change the rule
oh man this takes me back to when espn game highlights were real recaps of the game not just a 30 second highlight reel and the final score but actually letting you feel the highs and lows of the game
terry glenn shes wide open

thats so awesome
got to see this game in person it was great
i was just listening to these old nfl primetime songs this morning i love them
so many chill bumps
jerome bertie now up to 2 yards per carry on the season
this was the game i knew we had something special in ben
vts fumble was on 3rd down at about the 50 the debate was whether to close out the game with a first down or play it safe punt and have the steelers have to drive from deep in their own end

normally trying to get the first down and finish the game out is the right call but based on vts history theyd have been further ahead to keep the game out of his hands and run the ball
i remember this game
this title hurts to see eight hours late
dang big ben is old

roethlisberger 2020
heyward

watt

2020

you will never be loved like you will be loved by the city of pittsburgh and steelers fans
call me the united states cause i want to put more money into our already strong defense
hell end up cut since nobody will want to take on his contractthink texans can get out with little to no dead money
hypothetical whats the most you would give up for him if you did not have to be concerned with the salary cap

i would do it for a 4th with possiblyandisaypossibly talked into giving up a 3rd
kevin i know we dont typically do this kind of thing but i know that you know that we all know the window is closing i saw the trade up you made for bush we watched you trade a first round pick for fitzpatrick we never thought you would do it but youre all in on 7 as are we now i am asking you again please go get this man

fuck the cap
there is no way we trade for him with his salary next year there is a good chance no one does imo since his salary isnt guaranteed texas would be better off releasing him and letting jj be a free agent maybe then we can sign him to a i just want a championship kind of contract otherwise we cant afford him
could we collect the whole set
175m cap hit next year you can get that down a good 1012m with an extension but that requires a pretty long back loaded extension for a guy who will be 32 by the time he plays a down for you
i would love to have jj

id love to keep bud even more
it was my understanding that unless ben retires theres no way wed have the money for him
eh what position would he play exactly
dont do this to me dont give me hope
someone photo shop a steelers jersey on the watt family picture they took when they played the texans
fuck it tell him to lose weight and line him up at olb when we lose bud next year none of it makes sense but 2020 makes me want the fucking gratification of it all
jaromir jagr also should have retired as a penguin
how about all the watt brothers sign up some team friendly deal im sure the family is financially stable make a deal with tj derek to take a partial hit ask jj to take a hit and give them 2 maybe 3 years to see what can be done
yes pls
the watt trifecta
soon we will have all the infinity stones
ben really needs to take a huge pay cut
it would be awesome but do we really need him who are likely to lose on defense next year bud defense is still going to be stacked again feel like we can make moves on the other side of the ball that would help the team more
salary is the big deal with jj those claiming hes washed or where would we put him dont know what theyre talking about

firstly i guarantee jj ups his game especially if his little brother is on the line talking shit about how hes better brotherly rivalry is a thing and jj hasnt had a terrible season despite showing no interest in the shit show that is the texans

secondly something i havent seen brought up we could offer a 3rd to have the texans eat a majority of jjs contract on a signing bonus texans are clearly going to be rebuilding so i doubt the cap hit hurts them too hard given theyre 11 mil under the cap and will be pushing for rookies they already signed watson and i doubt johnson remains on the team who is a 11mil cap hit it makes things more complex to do it this way but it makes sense

the reason why jj would be nice to have if tuitt or heyward go down we really dont have the depth to mask their production everytime tuitt goes down we feel it helping the rotation with heyward tuitt and jj means theyre all much more fresh ingame and less likely to be injured longterm from a high snap count while also providing legit relief in the case of injury personally i see this as an absolute win if we can get jj here without having to eat his cap space long shot but its a legit shot
i would much rather he went to another team on a 2 year deal and sign him when hes done with that team at that age he would be a solid backuprotational player which we need a lot more than a solid starter
cool but theres no way well have the cap space to sign him without getting rid of enough highcap players that the team becomes a noncontender
why we run a three four
packers need a de he is going home not the burgh
trading for jj is a waste of most likely draft capital and cap space
no great player but hes always hurt and past his prime
we dont have the cap but it would be nice to see
the thought of winning a sb with his brothers and having that forever with his family has got to be a big draw for himi dont think he cares about doing it by himselfhe would have to take a massive pay cut which also doesnt seem like a big deal to himso maybe but green bay is probably at 85 to get him
imagine the glory of our defense
would we even have the cap space for him
im a texans fan and i want watt on a contender he deserves it and it would be something if all 3 watts were on one team
we arent allowed to talk about thisaccording to folks on hereshhhhh
come on home sir
we are much better off using the cap to keep bud juju and pay tj like the star he is

the king in the north
he needs a bigger codpiece for his gigantic balls
exquisite
appreciate the challenge flag in hand
yup thats my coach in all his glory
hopefully this season has a better ending than game of trones did king of the north
we need to get this on the sidebar of rravens
i think every player has been featured in this

what does the title of the post have to do with the article
we are good this year but i feel a touch too inconsistent to win a super bowl we have had incredibly good halfgames and horrible looking ones i feel like if both the offense and defense were in rhythm for a whole game even 3 solid quarters we could beat just about anyone seeing the very best of some of the top contenders such as seattle green bay kc titans ravens i think we are capable of beating all of them and weve beat two by the skin of our teeth if we are firing on all cylinders with the team we have
i guess this article can tell the future already giving us the win vs dallas
pretty damn good id say
we should be considered the clear favorite were more in command of our division and our destiny than any other team in football and our team is so well balanced that a couple random injuries hurt us less than they hurt most other teams

for all the whining you hear locally about oh woe is us were so inconsistent go watch some of the other teams you think of as elite just as a hint to the kind of inconsistencies you can expect consider if any other team were even more reliably good and consistent they too would be undefeated

every team has hits and misses what sets us apart right now is the fact that we have so much talent that usually when we suffer at some phase of the game for a while one of the other phases is there to pick us up were pretty much the only team in 2020 for whom that is the case
please make this game over quick i have a lot id rather do than watch a game in which there is even a glimmer of hope

thanks
just watch the 3rd quarter youll love it youll start thinking your team is a legit super bowl contender
really have a feeling this will be much closer than anyone is realizing
real fans watch disappointing games through

we had to put up with the infamous duo all last season
sorry thats not how we do things in pittsburgh
yeah i smell a trap game pleas no
just dont watch the game if you have better things to do im a ku fan i dont even bother wasting my time with their football games
cowboys fan you obviously havent watched much steelers football our mo is to get a lead by the end of the half and have the opponents needle us until our lead is only by three we will force a fumble with a minute left at our 20 and win
tell mike to throw in the towel early
this is aging well
i think until jerry jones gives up gm duties the cowboys r going to struggle to be a true super bowl contender
sorry not sorry thats steeler football we make things close for no reason but you guys are still in playoff contention


i have one of those too
ive been wearing a sweatshirt and a home juju jersey since week 1 and we won every game i didnt have the sweatshirt on for the first half of last week put it on and we won so ill keep wearing that shit lmao
thats awesome where did you get it
could you imagine beating brady and brown in the superbowl
that would be amazing but i dont think i would be alive to see it because i would have died of a heart attack during the afcg against the chiefs
and 5 coaches that either played for us or previously coached for us
only after beating bell and the chiefs in the afc championship
bucs retirement community in florida nonetheless

pittsburgh west became the villages south
not anymore

love it like how it has the same texture
i have one of these as well and let me say this before it even gets asked its very breathable one of my most comfortable masks to be honest it has a softer texture than what it looks like highly recommend
where do you get this
how can you post that and not tell me where to get it your a monster
here for anyone looking
i wear mine all the timeand i live in northeast ctin patriots country ive put up with so much of their fans shitnot so much this year

hes probably gonna bust a nut today on the field by accident
bro no you need the postnut clarity
reminds me of the running back from blue mountain state lmao
if he stays course by the end of the month he will be the leagues leading receiver quarterback running back kicker returner tackler and commentator
watch him start aggressively dominating the next few weeks
a stronger man than i but we knew that already considering i post on reddit and he is a steeler
rip defenders
definitely doubt it
i do not endorse this

wait im just realizing their presidents name is dick ass
was this you
mehnot bad for a running back
facts

why 2 months where did you order that from
no dont wear it wait till after this game
well lets all hangout here until we get some action
rivers just had a chance to replicate big bens td saving tackle lower stakes obviously but instead completely fucked it up add it on to the list of reasons ben is the best of that class
my favorite stat so far steelers opponents are 15 the week after playing the steelers the only win is the browns over bengals ravens are losing today

think about how badass we are that we literally cripple teams for an extra loss losing to the steelers is basically losing two games
every week i hope the steelers win and the ravens lose so right at this moment im a colts fan
refs gotta bail the ravens out again
did anyone see that ravens call dont want to ever hear those motherfuckers cry about refs again
i know were all watching the ravenscolts game and rooting for the colts but can we get love for the panthers right now them beating the chiefs would put us at a solid spot for the first seed in the afc right now its 143 carolina so things are looking pretty good
stupid ass ravens getting a strip
imagine banking on phil rivers to win a big game
the ravens are excellent at ball stripping we need to replicate that
ravens have a major steelers hangover zero rushing yards in the first quarter lmao
lol ravens would be getting blown out if it wasnt for that fumble td
kc and bal down

would shape up nicely for us
my hot take for this week was the ravens and chiefs both lose
dez and jesse james werent catches but that is

yeah ok
just saw the fucking ratbirds ran back a fumble for a td to tie it
baltimore lol
jake luton wtff
always fun watching the ravens get their asses beat
keep it up indy
is it best for a raven loss or colts
well recovery for allen
does anyone turn the ball over more than baltimore holy cow its too predictable
i dont believe in rivers whatsoever but maybe he can not fuck up something for himself for once and beat a top tier team
redzone time
holy hell lets go panthers
lets go panthers
dilemma i want the ravens to lose but i also know someone who is a colts fan and the thought of them being miserable gives me great joy

perhaps a tie keep that ravens browns comparison going

also are the bills gonna topple the seahawks today
live by the sword die by the sword
every minute that passes in these games we look better and better
ravens and chiefs both in trouble today lets prove why were kings of the afc today lets gooo
chiefs and panthers just traded missed field goals
was anyone else under the impression this was a 1pm game since last week ive got footblueballs right now
panthers just hit a fake punt on the chiefs and it was a beauty

edit td carolina
one of my steelers gcs is legit debating whether to watch charli or dixie damelio tiktoks as good luck charms for the game
we have a steelers discord
the wft is cursed if youre a qb
the upside if the ravens win it makes the steelers defense look even better because at least we held on
snr is reporting that juju andor chase claypool were dancing on the dallas star at midfield
k bills look utterly terrifying

wholesome content can confirm

nuts are a good source of healthy fats so i dont see why anyone would be concerned with cutting them out of their diet for a whole month
doubt ab will either

hes just waiting for his comeback

i perceive that you are a prophet
told my wife the aame thing a couple weeks ago
from your lips to gods ears
that would be the cats ass right there
ill just take a super bowl man
ben rides off into the sunset happy he can finally pig out on those oreos and have those late 2am buffet sessions at eat n park with no more restrictions or judgement and assume his final form mega fat fuk worlds laziest man

nah running backs run forward
big oof now

the og tb12
touchdown


damn not dereks watts
definitely nothing unexpected
glad to see hilton out and we got reggie watts out again i see
no real surprises im on board to let hilton and watt rest up here
so whats was the point of cutting nix he played great for us had one injured season then we cut him to sign a guy who barely plays and has only played 3 games at best

furthermore we cut edmunds who i expect to end back on the ps who is the only thing close to a backup fb we had goddamn dude

post game thread
so were just actively treating this as a bye week got it
if he makes this im shotgunning my beer

edit mama aint raise no bitch ill brb my yinzerz
that shouldve been a flag

but claypool shouldve 100 caught that it went straight through his hands
weird once ben starts play calling we move the ball almost like our oc is a bottleneck
there is no rule that the qb cant be the oc also
whoever got the false startmvp
dear bens knee please be okay i cant take another play with rudolph
thank god

steelers qb ben roethlisberger sustained a knee injury and was taken to the locker room prior to halftime to be further evaluated he is expected to return in the second half
how is dallas not getting flagged for jumping the snapper
so everyone knows the first few series of a game are scripted offensive plays everyone knows we struggle the first quarter of games until we stop using the game script so at this point if the only way we score is when ben can do what he wants why do we have a offensive coordinator
78 thank you very much for your service but lets not get ben killed when hes already on one knee

good int but damn it i wish minkah would have just gone down in the end zone
maybe the defense wouldnt be gassed if the offense could stay on the fucking field this is so stupid im tired of people telling me fichtner is anything better than the worst oc in the league its not even worth replying to you retards who still believe this shit when i point out shit like how ben changes the plays at the line or just straight up audibles out of garbage fichtner playcalling you tell me thats not a knock on fichtner actual fucking retards who argue with me on this sub about our incompetent oc

watch all of a sudden ben will start calling all the plays and the offense will be able to play football and people will tell me fichtner did a good job this shit is exhausting its the same shit every week
whatever age i die i want my family to know i would have lived another 20 years if i wasnt a steelers fan
help us juju youre our only hope
second time theyve gotten away with launching
the insurmountable 30 deficit fire everyone complete rebuild incoming
ben about to come out on those aaron rodgers drugs
i want to see some replays on this guy jumping over because i have seen that shit called so often
people are saying to chill but why this is fucking humiliating we have no offensive play calling and our defense is getting bossed by an aaf qb even if it isnt even the second half this is fucking embarrassing
wow ben is calling the plays and now we can move the fucking ball fichtner is so good right guys fucking morons
hahahahahaha made a fucking 59 yarder from boswell is good

please let ben be okay
miss a 54 make a 59 2020 in a fucking nutshell
lmao yall gotta stop overreacting if claypool makes that tough catch or the refs actually call pi wed be winning already its all good
you youngns might not member the good ole days but back then when the ben got hurt his passer rating received a 50 buff from badass mode activated

this is the most vintage game ever
this is by far the worst weve looked this season makes sense its in a game that we were prohibitive favorites
down 130 yall ready for run run incompletion because i sure fucking am
its funny how predictable this is starting to get we need to get it together its starting to get embarrassing
prediction ben comes out in the second half lights up the cowboys score 3513 steelers
i feel like steelers underutilize juju every time things start going to him big plays are made
everyone all week has been saying trap game apparently no one listened
i dont blame that on boz the cowboys were fucking in there
oh ye of little faith kneel now before your master the burger of roeth whose knee though composed of putty shall support great heaves of mightiness and downward touches galore

bask not in the glory of steeler nation this day for ye who have forsaken the black and gold deserve none of the fruits of our labor

cower in your corners ye faithless cursed be your names
pack it up boys seasons over

s
i cant do another season of rudolph seeing him at quarterback makes me want to puke
please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben
ben better trot his big oaf ass into that field for the second half
the cowboys scored 22 points combined in their last 3 games already have 19 on an elite defense
oh fuck thats not boswells fault

so anyone want to apologize
bruh that was the fastest quarter of football in history
give it to me again harder this time bos probably
59 yards a new record congrats to boswell and the steelers roy gerela must be happy
juju needs to stay
twice now dallas has jumped over the longsnapper isnt that illegal
its time

defense

its time

show this dallas qb what the fuck pressure means
3 pats would slap right now
boswell is entitled to a miss with how the rest of the team is playing he has been strong the whole season
how much could we pay a cowboys player to just run towards our sideline and break randys fucking legs
funny how our 2nd string qb never looked as good as their 4th
happened to watt 3 times but whatever
1st and 10

no 1st and 5

scratch that 1st and 15
you are without a doubt the worst 70 team ive ever heard of

ahh but you have heard of me
areare we getting these kinds of calls now is this how it feels
i wanna see a watt strip fumble
thats a chip shot fg to go up 8 points on a team with no timeouts what in the absolute fuck are they doing
what a game from minkah
im sending the county of allegheny a health bill for 2 heart attacks in one week fuck me
can ben just call all our plays fichtner is so trash
run on 2nd and fucking 14 fuck you randy
tj watt at least has showed up
keep buggs in send mondeaux to the bus
i cant figure out how anyone looks at rudolph and thinks the future
put dobbs in rudolph sucks
im not watching mason rudolph play football for the next 8 weeks
god im getting flashbacks from last season with rudolph at qb please ben be okay man i dont think i can see this garbage for the entire second half of the season
alright its halftime bless everyones and most importantly bens knee cowgirls are still trash heart attack whole second quarter as is steelers fashion we can do this lets riiiiide
guys dont worry im a pt he passed the lipshitz test hes fine
cowher telling it like it fucking is haha
holy shit we sent dupree and he got home rather then getting beat in coverage its a god damn miracle i really hate butler
that was a time consuming drive in fact most of the cowboys drives seem to go on forever we have maybe 4 possessions left at this rate
need 4 go for 30 0 steelers need to work on their math
looks like ben is finayseeing the bad matchups on juju
how is the ref going to call that holding when the dallas oline is literally wrapping around tj and dupree
who even had time to block he ran 5 yards
can anyone explain to me why they arent calling the leaping over the ls
are they going to call this guy jumping over the center at all
hard for boswell to make a kick when you have froggy hopping over every time
wed be up if it werent for those two blocked extra points

defense needs to make a stop on this drive and offense needs to at least get us in field goal range to put this away

this has been utterly ridiculous today
i thought you couldnt jump over the long snapper why is that not being called genuinely asking
id prefer a td with under 20 seconds i dont trust a field goal with that dude breaking through every time
we do this every fucking week


relax
why am i afraid of a 4th string qb making a 2 minute comeback
why would you not kick a field goal
a win is a win is a win
thats the worst ive ever felt after a win i think
chill its the first quarter

chill its only halfway thru the second you are here

chill its only halftime

chill theres still a quarter left

chill ben has a great 2 minute drill
please god dont make me watch a whole second half with rudolph under center
i literally just said out loud watch us run a pussy ass draw play on 2nd and long and wouldnt ya know it

lol just imagine steeler fans that we are in the playoffs and we are playing a team like the chiefs and decide to be running on 2nd and 14
yinzers say fire oc when 70

imagine thinking fichtner has any right to be the oc of a 70 team our offensive play calling is consistently ass
i expected nothing less and yet im disappointed
im not even mad i think we all expected this
defense got bailed out lol cooper wouldve had the first down if he doesnt fall why the fuck are they playing zone
cant wait to run the ball here we go fat fuck randy
massive pi and defensive holding no call
offense works when fitchner isnt involved
its amazing how well we move the ball when we let ben just do his thing
if mike tomlin was wearing his sunglasses like the first 7 games of the season we would not be having these problems
why dont we let ben run the offense all the time honest question the difference is insane
ill take ben in a wheelchair over rudolph in the second half
i dont care if we get blown out as long as ben can come back
if boz makes this ill name my firstborn after him

edit huh boz summerlin has a nice ring to it at least
this place is so bipolar right now and i love it
if ben didnt go in the locker room its tied mason sucks
whoever false started deserves a raise
in boswell we trust

x200b

59yd field goal is good
mason rudolph observationtoo much air under his throws very little zip
this game aint over until all the votes are counted
we are so good at making qbs who have never had any significant snaps look like they are seasoned vets with a couple rings lol

still a one score game im not panicking but i am very annoyed with the playcalling and sloppiness we should be torching this scrub defense
cant even blame bos on that one
is there some kind of higher force at work here
center in fg formation cannot be touched no
what the hell is up with these missed calls you cant use another person to launch yourself over the line im so over this game
we just arent going to call the penalty for pushing the center down while jumping over the center wtf is wrong with these refs this is like 101 there should never be pressure over the center
damn those missed extra points are looming large
i thought jumping the line was a penalty
this is it ben we believe in you fuck fichtner and do your thing
jesus is this how important alualu is to the defense
if we cant put up 20 points on this abysmal cowboys d how the fuck do we plan on winning anything in the playoffs this is a serious question
i could go for one of those game winning drives about now
renegade still playing wife is telling me turn it down but im yelling at the d to turn it up tequila brought me here
can someone please explain to me why we dont kick a fg and go up 8 points
not kicking the field goal was dumb as shit even if boswell missed it or it got blocked theyre not returning it for a touchdown and they still get the ball at the same spot they did

fire the special teams coach if you dont trust his unit enough to kick a 30 yarder to put the game away
my heart has exploded and my liver has erupted this team is killing me fuck it 80 baby
yall its still q1 lets relax
jesus you guys are soft lol
highsmith is going to be a draft steal i think
2nd and 14theyll never guess a handoff

yeah theres a reason for that
i really hope all you fitchner apologists are watching right now
why is haden back there
huh who would have thought this could be a classic steeler trap game well pull it out but it wont be pretty
fire keith butler

i mean he should have been fired after the jacksonville playoff game but i digress
everyone else i cant believe the 16 cowboys are beating the steelers

steelers fans par for the course
this run run pass predictability is getting old how the hell does the front office not see this how can they turn a blind eye to such horrible oc
ive been watching the steelers since i was 5 and they do this every year but god damn does it piss me off every time
its crazy how much of a difference we play when big ben calls the plays versus when he doesnt
hey these passes are working lets run a draw play 3x in a row
halftime adjustments
1 let ben draw plays in the dirt again
2 dont suck
wow they simply wont call dpis
boswell baby what is you doin
sometimes it just takes a few wacks to get ben going kinda like an old tv
queue the 2nd half knee bracepleeease
bens blood has got to be more than 75 painkiller at this point
not only did ben will his team to a td while injured he used the injury to bait the cowboys they thought he was going to continue to get it out quick and he used that to bait the double move unreal
things we learned rudolph is still bad
thats the most pittsburgh thing i could ever see
how many injections is ben gonna get at halftime
boz misses an extra point misses a 54 yarder drills the 59 yarder the man is good at redeeming himself
god i hope ben is ok i cant handle mason the redfaced qb again
the missed kick told him exactly how to adjust the irony
roboben better walk outta that tunnel for the second half
how about in future games we deactivate mason and activate dobbs
yay pissed off ben coming out if the tunnel go time
call me crazy but having bud and tj play middle linebacker doesnt seem like a super effective strategy
is our goal to allow a field goal on every drive
that gimpy knee fuck off nancy
anyone thinking this team was going 160 isnt aware of how hard it is to go undefeated in the nfl add in the fact that our bye week got moved to so early in the season and you can see its fucking amazing that we got to 70 now im not saying we wont come back in the end here im just saying maybe temper your expectations a little
a pissed off big benscary stuff
3rd and 4 better bomb it sounds about right
we trying to get ben killed we saw what their pass rush did to the eagles and it feels like we completely didnt prepare
just 4 safeties and we are back in this game
tony romo can you believe it if this is the game they lose

all steelers fans yes
honestly im not saying were gonna lose yet but if yall didnt expect this game to go this way you aint been watching steelers football for the last 20 years
we have to find a way to resign juju just have to
why the heck did half the line not stand up for that kick
i thought you couldnt push off the blockers to try to jump the line
i though you couldnt jump the snapper anymore
special teams can fuck off
shouldve just stayed in the endzone
why did he run it out
im fucking hyped but minkah you got to take a knee there 20 yards of field position and now were backed up
minkah and juju doing it by their fucking selves
this is the drive for our offense to show we are 70 cant go 3 in out right now
as hard as ive been on this team for today its hard to win more than 7 or 8 games when youre undefeated still theres no reason for this to be a heart attack game against such a bad team
pick 6 from our d please
i thought you couldnt jump over the snapper on field goals
can we please not allow a 14 play gilbert led scoring drive
why do the steelers to this to us
i cant get over romo saying that was a good call to not kick the fg
tj being held by his fn neck
i need to train my dog to dial an ambulance just in case i happen to be watching one of these games with no one else in the house
never had a doubt lets fucking go
yo bengals fan here boswell is elite someone please rewind their dvr and find the clip of mike tomlin pointing at and congratulating boswell after he hit the 59 yarder and broke yalls franchise record
maon scans the field from the pocket like me looking to buy my wife the right tampons at giant eagle
if we lose this game alot of it is on fichtner this offense is pathetic 9 points on a 26 team

should of been a flag for holding
how dare that inferior team score on us first

we must enact absolute punishment in response to these inappropriate actions
i just want ben to yell back no the next time a screen is called
randy fichtner is shit
imagine coming out as a big road favorite and just not completely sucking shit every single time

it must be nice
this offense runs a whole lot better when it isnt hamstrung by rustbelt randy
cbs shows all look universally terrible always
ben needs to trade helmets with kam canaday or sean davis or something so he cant hear fichtner anymore
25 yards in the first quarter against dallas practice squad defense i mean sure i guess because me being frustrated means im not a steelers fan
touching moment guys this is my sons first trap game he doesnt understand why we are playing so badly they grow up so fast
today is god damn birthday and i want is to stay undefeated lets go dammit
has success passing
call two consecutive run plays for no gain
slow starts are frustrating as fuck
seriously absolutely fuck keith butler tj needs to give him a good slap
actually insane that this team has had so many weapons on offense this decade and cant find a decent coordinator
why do games like this happen every goddamn season man lol
2 scores down to a team with a scrub qb if youre a pro youre embarrassed
someone just unplug randys headset and tell ben he can have first crack at the buffet afterwards if we win and well be fine
let ben cook it up meth lab style
fuckin pi
did the cowboys just unlock mid season injured ben hope he is good that sucks
how are these pass interferences not being called oh yeah theyre not being committed by the steelers
now youve unleashed injured ben you fucked up dallas
and thats what happens when you let ben call the plays and not fichtner

ill say it again fire fichtner
guys i fucking love ben roethlisberger
missed pat indoors you got to be fucking me
good thing we learned from last season and invested in a good backup qb
we really could have used our regularly scheduled bye two weeks ago thanks titans
oh i didnt miss rudolph
this is what life without ben looks like
how could anyone forget how bad mason is you watched last season right
mason rudolph on my tv is giving me ptsd
mason rudolph spends his offseason training with limas sweed
this game is a meme
boz see 54 yds was too short a field
the false start was a strategic move
was that really a franchise record long fg
let me miss this pat and kick a 59 yarderboswell probably
ahhthe strategic false start to kick a longer field goal after missing a shorter field goal

just like they drew it up
good job on boswell there since he got iced like three times lmao
how can the the cowboys have a 4th or 5th qb that can throw a ball but the steelers cant find a second stringer that can zip it mason floats it w zero power he sucks put dobbs in
ive been searching twitter for updates on ben i found this from burt lauten the pittsburgh steelers director of communications hope hes right



steelers qb ben roethlisberger sustained a knee injury and was taken to the locker room prior to halftime to be further evaluated he is expected to return in the second half
cowher still one of us
they said ben is expected to return
remember to thank the titans for fucking up our bye still a lot of season left to play
this cowboys team is pretty good especially that brady guy
being down 1 possession at this time isnt bad given how this game has played out now its on ben and the offense to answer
this is where the o starts doing pittsburgh things lets fucking go about to be 8 and 0
like where the fuck is our offensive line today
big al almost got him killed
honestly baltimore was less painful to watch at this point last week
3rd and 4 try to chuck it for 35 yards when we havent hit on a deep ball all game big brain fichtner
this is the laziest tackling ive seen all season
cant wait for us to come out and run 2x then chuck it deep
outside of the fumble dallas has had a long drive points on almost every drive
can you believe if this is the game that they lose

literally every steelers fan called it
juju is the answer
i dont give a fuck how ugly it is

a win is a win we got this
canaday has been getting blown the fuck up off the snap
juju and ben are the only ones on offense who came to play
i truly dont understand how thats not leverage
i wish i could be as shit at my job as danny smith and not have to worry about being fired leave his ass in dallas
minkah fitzpatrick the goat
wish theyd just kneel in the endzone for the touchback on those
almost shit all over the floor when that flag came out oh my god
i have worn a jersey for every win this season today i didnt wear one for whatever reason i put one on right before the interception by fitzpatrick im so sorry everyone wont happen again
tony who gives a fuck if it was open handed
wish we had 2 more points rn
really missing those two xps right now
at least we have a return guy that can hang onto the ball
eat our dick dallas
would it really be a steelers game if our blood pressure and heart rates werent elevated x3 with our assholes clenched drenched in sweat watching our defense save the game yet again
steelers football and heart palpitations name a more iconic duo
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
yes you overreacted when we were down

its ok i forgive you same time next week
lol if steelers lose tomlin bout to get lit up
why do 15 out of the 16 games every year have to be heart attacks
pittsburg dad is gonna need cpr
a field goal sure would be nice right now
dumbass decision tomlin thank you minkah for the win
best use of a first round pick ever
tf we really gotta do better so these games dont come down to the final play all the time
i cant take anymore of these games this team will be the end of me
and here i was looking forward to a stressfree sunday
why leave the endzone
catch the ball dammit
romo king of understatements cowboys get away with a little bit of a hold
i know that probably couldve been a penalty but id like to see claypool go get that ball
highsmith first sack
my goodness some of you lol
pathetic
now this is steelers football
you have to love that run play on 2nd and 14 truly astounding play calling
no idea why this team gets complacent against teams like this its absolutely ridiculous
run run pass punt that sounds like a randy special
every week i bitch about fitchner and every week he continues to deliver subpar offensive playcalling we have all this young talent and it feels wasted for so much of every game

glad to see were back to our predictable run run pass
worst 1st quarter of the season
can we just let ben call the plays donate fat fuck randys paycheck to something
romo reading this shit like a book
running on 2nd and long has a massive gap compared to passing in terms of epa the steelers have done it twice on two drives with benny snell noless and punted two plays later each time

only six teams in the nfl run less often than the steelers in that spot and three of them have mobile qbs which clouds the numbers

im not overstating it when i say that specific playcalling tendency is one of the biggest thing that stands in the way of steelers offensive consistency
supposed to be the easiest team to run on in the league right
zeke looks stoned out of his mind on the sideline
8 completions in a row into 3 straight runs for a yard and a hald
somehow a 4th string qb is secretly lamar and brady combined
this is steeler football
if your new welcome to the trap game
about to go down 100 to the cowboys looking bad in the process
havent scored in 110 minutes of game time 4th choice qb who is starting his first game yeah i dont know why i didnt see this first half coming

hopefully we can make some adjustments soon to counter this
im not worried about the outcome yet but i hope these guys are thoroughly ashamed of themselves
all the veteran steelers fans are just vibing we freak out in the second half if shit hits the fan
damn much respect to dallas for that holy shit
do we want to play today or what
broncos fan here yall are not gonna lose to the cowboys so chill
that was a long ass commercial amazon lol
dallas stacks box


steelers lets run up the middle
bens calling plays and were moving who woulda thought that
after this two minute warning i want a quick td strike to claypool or juju make it happen
flag are you fucking kidding me
didnt know you can tackle someone like that before the ball arrives
are you fucking kidding me with that no call
what the actual fuck is going on with the missed calls jesus christ that was a fucking mugging on chase and that was a huge fucking miss on that hit on ben
this is what happens when ben starts calling plays ladies and gentlemen
ok that drive convinced me that randy sucks and ben needs to be the oc
boz has been demoted to boz demigod
ya know other teams get roughing the passer calls for a lot less than that doublesided hit ben took but its ben and the steelers so we dont get those calls
a wounded animal is the most dangerous especially when its cornered big mistake dallas you should have killed him
how is mason still so unprepared
just practicing for that 59yd kick
best false start of all time
boz missed from 54 but hits 59 lmaooo
ok boswell you can get back to town nvm

thatll do boz thatll do
well thats a career long i believe
i am sorry i doubted you bosgod please dont forsake me
longest fg in steelers history
please for the love of god let ben be okay
bosgod
the ice your own kicker with a false start so he gets an extra practice kick just like they drew it up
1110 level iq play there knowing your kicker is going to miss so you intentionally false start

next level stuff
please just let bens knee be okay please
if pittsburgh was a pokmon

ability slow start
cowher restraining himself very well from punching that dude while he smack talking the steelers
if theyre letting ben back in they ought to put a brace on that knee
why are watt and dupree getting matched up against cooper and lamb
80 looked so easy but now it looks like an unneeded battle to the death
all things considered weve given up one shitty td and then a fg off a big special teams play and this fg

need the offense to show up
ok ben get a td now for reals
play calling continues to be garbage no doubt it was making rudolph even worse
are the refs actually going to call pi in the 2nd half
we only needed four effing yards not 40
dallas 6m fg drive

steelers 3 and out
3rd4 doesnt mean bomb it 40 yards
well at least berry is doing well
really need to start throwing the check downs
jesus that was a massive hit on ben

fucking hell ill be disappointed but ill take a loss if we leave this game fully healthy
how can we manage to always make bum quarterbacks look like jesus in his prime
3rd and long sure let them just easily run it
theyre leading us by 10 min in top precisely because we cant stop the rush worth a shit
thank god mccarthy is a pussy and kicked the fg
defense is gassed cant keep up tackling is garbage
steelers look severely outcoached today who knows maybe the loss of a bye week is catching up to them but the effort and game plan is pathetic so far
this isnt a clunker against a 610 team this is an embarrassment against what barely can be considered an nfl roster super bow caliber teams dont have games like this
cmon need some audibles to throw their rookies off
bens mvp run starts right now
juju has been open all day but have been wasted by all the deep throws glad they finally see he is getting open
juju was the whole drive good shit
can they not protect the kick
thats when you know its just not your night lol
boosting on the long snapper is illegal isnt it
ffs what are our st doing today
seriously did everyone forget how to tackle in the last week
shouldve kneeled that one
thank you minkah very cool
kinda wish he hadnt run it out lol
minkah pickpatrick
oh it wasnt a punch yeah his arm was just swinging for no reason
all i know is that the villain in football movies had neck pads
claypool was open too dammit man
those fucking extra points
we should be up 1 right now
we need a count on how many balls ben has had knocked down at the line this season its like an astronomical amount
kick the ball out please for the love of god
watt sack coming followed by watt interception coming
its time for a tj watt strip sack
mongo like tackle
ok ben do this you got this youre a hall of famer this is what you do
2119 is the final
now all we have to do is keep a 4th string qb out of the endzone and it seems like a fucking impossibility lmao
apparently you gotta game plan for gilbert who knew
oh great zone defense time
bend dont break bend dont break bend dont break
i honestly want to know what happens when we game plan against bad opponents
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
sometimes the steelers play like a drunk person whos trying to demonstrate they are not drunk
were gonna win on a pick in the endzone with like 2 seconds left because thats how things work
cam heyward is my dad
ugly win but please remember the chiefs barely beat the panthers 3331 today all nfl teams good and bad are still nfl caliber teams the difference is that the best teams always find a way to win
why the fuck didnt you kick a field goal
serious question why didnt the steelers just kick the field goal and go up by 8
why didnt they just kick a fucking field goal
oh man theres that feeling again
how do you not go for a fg
i know boswell has been ass today but u kick the fg and youre up 8
in no world do you not kick a field goal there
why the fuck didnt we kick a fg
why didnt they kick the fucking field goal
if they steal this tomlin losing a lot of goodwill
whatever happens not kicking it was a bad call 8 point lead gives you some leeway boz missee it were in the same situation
once more d once more
steelers taking years off of my life
2 weeks in a row minkah with the game saving deflection he had himself a big game today
why does this team want to kill me in my mid 20s
rudolph throwing with the velocity i throw tennis balls to my dog in the back yard
nothing would be more steelering than beating the ravens only to lose to the dallas cowboys
damn after one drive yall kill me
i swear ben acts like hes hurt to fake teams out then he starts dropping dimes big brain ben
yall really have no faith bunch of knee jerk reactions instead of looking at the big picture down by 4 into the half is nothing even if rudolph stays in hes got more experience than gilbert with a wide array of weapons and the top defense in the league at his back

tomlin is king of 2nd half adjustments justchill
psa you cant decline a false start as the play should have been dead before the clock starts
anyone else upset seeing someone run around wearing 99 and its not brett keisel
what a fucking trainwreck

dallas had only punted once with a fourth string qb this is why the chiefs got rated ahead of us
gameday meal chili paneer and gobi manchurian indochinese fried rice and flatbread with paneer
3 beers in at the bar lets go
plz for the love of god dont fucking play down to the cowboys just play your game with no injuries and gtfo
jesus can i wear sunglasses kicking in that direction
highsmith making splash plays already love to see it
tj has the fastest time off the line ive ever seen
the 2nd down play call what a bold call
steelering in progress
run run short pass absolutely brilliant fitchner
ok its hard to be mad on a macro level at a team thats 70 but this is an absolutely pathetic start
even dionte johnson looked at fitchner like wtf is this on that drive
ben for oc 2020
omg these yinzers want to fire a coachcoaches off of a 70 team
mccarthy has like 4 chins its kind of impressive
that was really superb discipline from the dline and lbs very good awareness to be able to tell they were just trying to draw them off
for everyone that didnt notice on that punt return with haden returning the defense was on the field i guess in case the cowboys tried to do something funky on 4th inches
zeke looks like a fucking ewok
im not a rb but sometimes i feel like they need to just keep ring instead of wiggling all around
someone remind fichtner that james conner exists
man this run game is worrying oline losing big time
65 240lb qb with a yard to go

lets go in shotgun rather than sneak it
i miss jerome bettis
mondeux is fucking trash
classic trap game

fichtner apologists all over this sub most predictable play calling in the nfl without a hof qb operating it our offense was anemic since randys playbook is dogshit even with a hof qb operating it its hit or miss
they are literally playing with us this game is everything i expected

looking forward for halftime adjustments because thats embarrassing right now
huh looks like dallas got mvp vick in disguise as their qb
you can tell these guys walked in to the stadium thinking this would be any easy win
i really hope this isnt going to be another steelers special against a fucking shit team
why can this 4th string qb execute long drives but our team cant
this thread is always so depressing
i really didnt want to believe this would be a trap game

how do you look this bad against a 3rd stringer
stop putting watt in coverage
must be our annual play down to the opponent game
so we keep covering wrs with lb huh
why the fuck is watt on fucking lamb
why is watt given that assignment
what the fuck defense is this are you fucking serious
tj watt covering a wr on third down
why the fuck is tj on ceedee
playing down to losing teams classic steelers
why the hell do you have tj watt covering and not pass rushing i honestly dont understand
why cant this team ever address the basic problem or thinking they can beat bad teams by just showing up and not being prepared against them
someone help me explain how we arent even blitzing and yet we leave a dude wide open in the end zone make it make sense
3 attempts to get 1 yard and we cant get it

our running game really is garbage
why the fucking fuck is tj watt on lamb instead of breaking havok on the ol
are they still people defending this play calling its just funny at this point i am so fucking disappointed so far it doesnt matter being 70 or 07 this game preparation is terrible so far
what a shitshow
the epitome of steelers football baby
cant be mad at that play dallas showed up to play and so far we havent
getting out played and outsmarted im pissed off
everybody in here acting like they expected differentthis is a steelers special
you know what fair play on that punt return shows a good use of a trick play unlike we are used to when we call fake punts etc
i know we are notoriously a second half team but jesus
trap game fuck me we are playing like horse shit
we are being outplayed in all 3 phasea
ok guys this upcoming drive is the drive
on the plus side berry is absolutely boomin the ball
welp time for another run run pass 3 and out
i still think we win but this was predictable and we can put to bed the idea for the time being that we are as good as the chiefs and it doesnt matter right now anyway what matters is who is better at the end of the year and clearly we have a lot of room for improvement which is actually a very nice thing to say about a team that is 70
0 points in a half is unacceptable no matter who youre playing let alone one of the worst defenses in the league
if for our offense to be functional ben has to make up plays in the huddle then randy fitchner isnt being effective
lets just let 2 minute ben be 60 minute ben instead and have randy take a vacation
no pi

no hands to face on the dt

are there refs
lmaowait what that isnt pi
everyone knows that hurt ben is best ben
great job ebron
bens gonna have the aaron rodgers post game interview my knee
we needed that touchdown but the cost on bens health this drive is too much
ben starts calling the shit he knows he can do with a tweaked knee

randy exits the picture

td
boswell bruh come on
jesus christ boz
see flair
ben and boz secretly swapped knees during replay
lets fucking go ben way to be fucking tough
so healthy ben is trash but 1 legged ben is the goat
ben plays the best when hes a little banged up
pump fake automatic td
ill take hobbled big ben over mason any day
i wasnt nervous until now if we end up with rudolph second half we are most likely fucked
fuck i do not want mason in there
i love all of yinz but calm down 1 this is steelers football so its not over till its over and 2 its going to be fine even if we lose were still a great team id rather lose this game than lose ben or have another starter out
if the refs make the correct and obvious pass interference call on the claypool long pass ben doesnt take that hit and injure his knee on the next play
rudolph looks like hes lobbing horseshoes instead of a football
dear god rudolph sucks
active dobbs next week pls
dobbs couldve at least scrambled and made a play
we really need ben to be ok
who got their online phd and wanna early diagnose this bitch
ok time to sign fitzmagic
is it too late for fitzmagic
haha 59 yard attempt shot now
watch boz make the 60yd fg now lol
luckiest false start ever
boz fucking god

have my kids
bozgod wanted a challenge
not gonna lie im fucking stunned he made it from that far lol
boswell fucking redeemed himself holy shit
bozdemption
tactical false start
of course boswell gets a 59 yard field goal congrats to him
just hope bens knee is good
great job wizard of boz

now really is ben okay because we need him so bad
is ben ok
rudolph still trash then good good
i actually like dobbs better than mason dobbs has a way stronger arm mason throws ducks no pun intended
steelers seem to stalk their prey for a while then strike no half heroes
everyone lend big bens knees your energy
dont usually get on randy but his play calling has been sus this first half
hes backkkkkk
i love bens willingness to play through injuries but he is going to have a shitty retirement dude has broken and torn everything
i hate how moody this team makes me lol guess ill watch a drive or two and see what happens hope ben isnt trying to play through anything serious
x200b

it is a proven fact the more beat up roethlisberger gets the better he plays
am i stupid or did romo just say that cooper had a juicy ass
why havent we utilized the new lb at all i thought he was good in the run
im glad minkah stayed home on that play
feels like the d has no sense of urgency
stop dropping dupree and watt in coverage fuck me
lmao getting absolutely destroyed by a 26 team with a fourth string qb playing in his first game
let us not forget this very good cowboys team is fighting for first place in their division no shame in having to struggle against them
finally bud nice
all yall who were talking shit before this game knowing full and well the steelers love a good trap game you did this to us

s
cowboys in their last three games combined 22 points
cowboys today 16 points in 23 quarters
last thing we need is ben getting knocked around more just let him call what he sees
i bet randy called every play on that drive
3rd and short better bomb it out
wide open conner down low instead take a terrible hit and throw a shit pass
villanueva needs help hes gonna get ben killed
bens gonna be sore tomorrow
anyone who is at all surprised at this performance must be new here
is ben really the only thing keeping randy employed here
how many times can we have a lb guard a wr
are we playing against tom brady what the fuck is this
how do all these 3rd stringers always turn into tom brady against us
getting absolutely carved up by an aaf qb is such a steelers thing to do lmao
my boss is a cowboys fan and he was expecting the worst for this game but i told him dont worry the steelers will find a way to disappoint me
none of us were joking when we said last week that we would make this guy look like brady
the effort isnt there dallas wants it more frankly they deserve it gotta show every week
cam sutton scared to make the tackle smh besides haden the corners playing scary make the tackle missing hilton right now
its so easy for them they are doing whatever they want with us making zero adjustments
im not sure if the offense or the defense should be more embarrassed just pathetic
were playing a 4th string qb yes but remember butler is a moron nothing but zone constantly dropping dupree and watt in coverage and getting zero pass rush
wow so they cant score and they give up 615 in one possession

not looking good our d is not good against the run anymore
while i do like watson as a qb he is a terrible actor and that aws commercial is unwatchable
its like this team doesnt even care about the one seed they talk about how the super bowl is the goal and yet they play down to every opponent

the defense has been completely exposed by this point its not good enough without bush
dallas studied our game plan and we kept it the same because we underestimated them we studied their game plan and they changed it even if we win this game is obnoxious
god damn i want dallas to choke bring the game back already
sigh shooting themselves in the foot
steelers arent even trying anymore
god bless juju man
i think we havent won a ball game in cowboys stadium yet correct me if im wrong
niiiiice juju okay d time to step up
for the 4th quarter lets stop playing like clark kent and put on our superman outfit
juju cannot be a cap casualty next year thread
yet another game where once juju is targeted the tides turn
he walked right through the center
special teams today
0 boswells fault the first one was on him but that defender waltzed in and bos had no shot
do we have a special teams coach or are we just winging it
just kick the ball out of the back of the end zone you dumb fucks
i feel like we ask this almost every game how does danny smith still have a job hes never been anything more than average and pretty consistently a breakdown awful game once a month
fuck this special team play they are cost us this game
give me a competitive loss im cool with that but we get this shit all the time
fuck zeke and fuck this gilbert guy jam their dick into the dirt
minkah ffs go down for the touchback
x200b

minkah fitzpatrick so goood
m i n k a h
minkah doing a lot lately
shoulda stayed in the end zone
bout time for a 98 yard maple td
why didnt he fall in the end zone adrenaline
another juju 97 yard td
dear baby jesus in a tux let the good guys got get a td
wheres the guy who said fire tomlin and cut minkah
juju 90 yd td
so that was a 19 yard return for minkah
come on steelers you gotta pull through cowboys have the worst defense in the nfl dont let the cowboys win ffs
i swear there are people on this sub who downvote any comment that mentions the name cowher even if something completely innocuous and factual like bill cowher was the coach like time pittsburgh and dallas played in the super bowl its as if they think even acknowledging that we had a coach prior to mike tomlin is somehow a criticism of tomlin like that scene in the lion king when scar lost his shit over people saying the name mufasa
wheeeew we got lucky there
you would never know claypool was a rookie by the way he runs his mouth out there
i love refbal
really wish we had made that extra point
defense needs to stand up and destroy
we should be winning thanks to special teams gaffes
man claypool was wide on that 2nd down
that papadia looks gross
defense is going to be crucial this drive
tj with 3 deflections today

tj swatt
sack this fourth string reject
great now someone make a goddamn play
everybody take this commercial break for a breather and get your heart ready for anything
their 4th stringer is a million times better than rudolph
on one hand were in a great position to take the lead and win on the other hand this game has been ass
feed juju
this might just be a renegade moment coming up
we are getting bailed the fuck out this game
didnt expect that from ebron
ebron is a monster
fuck of course we dont get the 2
fuck ok this is all defense now
chuckles

im in danger
quick shout out to the refs
oh mama im in fear for my life
from the long arm of the law
lawman has put an end to my running
and im so far from my home
oh mama i can hear you a crying
and youre so scared and all alone
hangman is coming down from the gallows
and i dont have very long
lets go defense
defense still playing soft we are getting burned in zone and man2man
getting destroyed in fantasy ill gladly take the l if it gives us a w against the cowboys
really wish we had those pats
two types of fans in the world

me twirling my terrible towel in the living room screaming at the tv

my wife sitting quietly on the couch with her terrible towel over her head and eyes cause she cant watch this haha
tj watt is the true dpoy it might not show in every stat
cammmmmmmm lets goooooo
i would just love to have one sunday where i can relax and have a nice blowout
you could almost hear cam say i aint losing this shit as he went through the line
very concerning to be this close to a 26 team
why tf do you go for it
wtf tomlin wtf
no field goal to make it an eight point lead wow
why not kick the fg and go up 8
what the actual fuck what the actual fuck
yeesh and now not kicking the field goal is a big issue after 1 play
a field goal makes it an 8 point lead theyd need a td and 2 point just to push ot why the hell did we not do that

absolutely awful decision kick the field go up 8 and take more time off the clock with the kickoff
holding on tj lol
lol if we lose this is all on coaching
dont stop the count
like what the fuck guys this was supposed to be a second bye week
lol minkah there again wow
x200b

steelers stay unbeaten

win 2419
i gotta say everyone anouncers and other fans pretending this is shocking you could see we were gonns do this from a mile away
minkah
same exact play as last week with fitzpatrick
game ball to minkah holy deja vu
my heart needs a bye week
can the refs call a hold that guy nearly killed tj
i hope this means 2 weeks from now were going to slaughter the jags since weve now had our trap game
the toll on my heart these past 3 sundays might need to visit the docs
i just want to point out that i still want to pick updraft a real ben replacement the idea that if ben goes down and were stuck with rudolphdobbs after the amazing season weve had thus far is scary af
bens deep ball has been off all year
if this drive doesnt show that randy needs firing idk what anything means ben is doing everything himself on one leg
i went pee and missed the td guess ill just listen to the rest of the game from the bathroom
this game thread is a dumpster fire of negativity already we have the best team in the league but a real shitshow of a fanbase at times
were already in the 4th stop the count
if this sub coached our team we would be 07
got to catch that
bro you gotta catch that
catch that bro
claypool shouldve had that one not on ben
claypool has to catch that
as long as that stuff is called evenly im okay with it
i hate this damn allstate ad i keep thinking its gonna be inception related its not im disappointed fuck you allstate
interviewer what went into the decision in making gilbert the starter

mccarthy i just thought about which guy i would miss the least
fuck i forgot to play renegade before the game its my fault i was doing homework im so sorry do i play it now or what
this thread does not believe in the power of positive thinking
with that lb alex highsmith sack pittsburgh has registered at least 10 in 65 consecutive games which is the longest active streak in the nfl the 65game streak is the longest in regularseason franchise history
fucking conservative i see
stop with the shit play calling
we got an update
fucking annoying play calling
steelering intensifies
fucking hate randy sphincter
can ben just go hurry up in the first quarter
so um can i start to worry now
i wonder how long its going to take randy and the two time to break down this formidablecowboys defense

like if we fire randy does the two time walk away or something is that why he has to be here
can ben call the plays
colquitts not doing that
randy you fucking donut
these run backwards 7 yards and dump the pass off 3 yards and loose 4 yards plays need burned out of the playbook
that ad for irregular heartbeats was literally made for steelers fans it had to have been
i hate how our playcalling just feels like guessing every week how do we not have a plan to attack one of the worst defenses in the league getting stuffed two drives in a row the start a little embarrassing
tuitt just like casually pushed that lineman out of the way and walked up to tackle the running back
so when do we turn the d loose to brutalize an aaf qb
i swear if we lose to the fucking cowboys
etrade if this is your idea of

me well it is now
omg youre telling me when we are aggressive and pass we move the ball im shocked
mcfarland as a third down back why
offensive line is getting no push
why are they having so much trouble running against a team with a piss poor run defense youre crazy if you tell me this isnt a trap game
im all for getting mcfarland some plays but you have to have you best players on the field until its out of reach

3 and 4th andt 1 and you dont have conner out there
mccarthy alright theyll punt it here an why is the offense still out there timeout timeout theyll actually go for it timeout
only randy fichtner could be outcoached by mike nolan
why are we incapable of dominating its honestly inexcusable
offense weak as fuck again its a legit problem right now since the 2q of titans game theyve put together like 5 solid looking drives
ive seen this trap game coming weeks in advance
fuck mondeaux
same failed run 3 plays in a row we have so many pieces on offense that we can be creative with wtf fichtner
get mondeauxs bum ass outta the game
i dont want to see us run the ball with anyone but connor
what a waste of a half
i am straight up not having a good time
hey can we play like an undefeated team now please
typical steeler football play down to a team who should be 16 fucking dumb something has to change with this offense and not like the d is doing us any favors
so we put our best rush defender on a burner of a wr
tj watt guarding ceedee lamb
their o line seems to be getting away with an awful lot of holding so far
watt should not have been on lamb
they cant score againt the eagles or the fucking football team but they score against our league best defense what the fuck
i said to take tj out of coverage after gilbert ran to his side of the field the first time he was in coverage next time hes in coverage they put him on ceedee for a td lol butler is a fucking idiot i swear
we play to the team against us no wonder why we are playing horribly its dallas
maybe theyll wake the fuck up now
this is pathetic
3rd and 7 you gotta make sure your best passrusher is in coverage on a receiver
crazy idea on 3rd down lets rush the passer with the best pass rusher in the game rather than have him be one on one with their fastest wide reciever
meh were a comeback team
this game is making my hangover worse
coaching staff clearly treated this like a bye week and thought they could fart their way to a win
the offense starting off slow more often than not needs to be fucking addressed

whether its play calling or tempo i dont know if ben is that much better calling is own plays just fucking let him
where the fuck is conner
spent all week looking at memes of our record instead of watching film or preparing
im just here for the over reactions
why the fuck is our best pass rusher covering a wide receiver
ok the fun is over get your heads in the game
ahhh wondered when the annual fire everyone game would come
if yinz seriously didnt expect this to happen you havent been watching steeler football for the past 10 years

typical trap game just substitute browns for cowboys itll come down to the wire like always
can ben just say fuck fichtner and go off script now please
if you dont love this then you dont love steelers football
thats a better throw than any of the ones roethlisberger has made today
what in the blue flaming fuck are we doing
i mean that was a sick play lol
cant wait to go down 170 and then do run run 2 yard pass
randy got the perfect run run dump off ready to go
what a fucking embarrassment no life out there at all
that one was all luck stop playing padded zone you fucking cocksucker this is all on butler and fictner
got to score on our possession
why cant we just beat the cowboys what is it about this fucking team
imagine this is the game where berry actually punts well for once and we fucking blow it
im almost more afraid of random backup qbs than i am of mahomes and lamar
lol im not hating and keeping it 100 we will not win shit in the playoffs if we are this fucking conservative its like the playcalling is for a rookie who is playing his first nfl game
dont forget that dallas will get the ball to start the 2nd half this could be a 3 possession game pretty soon
ahhh

the classic slow start to a shit team and a nobody at qb

one of these games

fucking great
i truly do not understand how tomlin can see how well this offense plays when ben is calling the plays and how effecient they are and then just give play calling duties back to randy let randy draw up the plays let ben call them
the long throws just arent there this season
pulling his jersey the whole way
tony romo hates us and its obvious
so apparently you can hold receivers now and it is just fine fuck these refs in the ass with a rusty rake
pouncey is garbage today hes getting destroyed all game
why the fuck isnt that a penalty
i dont need this random cowboys equipment manager arguing for an incomplete call lmao
ben a gangster lol
ben playing better with 1 leg

wtf
the lighting in that stadium sucks ass
ebron coming in clutch on third down
holy shit its like we have a hof qb with how many passes we keep completing

someone tell randy
thats my fucking quarterback
ben 2 minute

classic
finally all it took was hurt ben
robotic ben activated
amazing when ben is hurt they start calling smart pass plays and stop with whatever the fuck they were doing before
big shit from big ben
bosgod is now just boswell
thats what happens when ben is calling the plays


but also


oh god
no boz no
im worried hes done for the rest of the game after watching that locker room walk
of course we miss the pat
boz misses and ben goes to the locker room
locker room hopefully nothing serious i certainly hope he didnt pull a carson wentz in 2018 and go out for the year to score one td
and a missed xp we always do that too in these trap games its really weird that it even effects our kicking game as well
people on this sub will legit say fichtner had any hand in making that drive work

hey the truth is he didnt
pissed off or hurt ben is always so methodical if he stays in we can expect a few more tds
you know we are about to get a turnover and see mason in the game to end the half because that would be perfect irony for them working out that bruise on ben early
sorry kia that was a 180 once you land any further spinning is irrelevant
i really hope ben is ok i dont think were gonna manage with out him
2 yard passes are back in the menu boys


its the only thing on the menu
minkah master of being in the right place at the right time and thats awesome
maon lucky as hell that wasnt a pick jfc
just run it up the middle and call timeout i have no faith in this turd
i hope big ben is okay and can come back to the game
yeah fuck you rudolph
trap game
the absolute wad of gum from the steelers specials team coach i forgot his name lol
holy shit
wizard of fucking boz
sorry boswell i take it back
sometimes penalties are a friend
that false start gave boz an idea to where he needed to aim all part of the master plan
no more punting field goal every 4th down
lmao boswell just had to get warmed up
maybe we should just false start every extra point and let him kick from 55 indoors
lets fucking go haha thanks for the false start
boz does not miss three times in a row
boz gotta buy cam dinner now
oh ye of little faith in the bosgod
bosgod giveth and bosgod taketh away
youre forgiven christopher
come on halftime adjustments i love me some pittsburgh halftime adjustments
man rudolph sucks ass
lets all just appreciate the bozgod
can someone perform the lachman test on ben please where is our pt at
somehow we are only down by 4 pts hopefully big ben is alright and we can get this dub
can we just give dobbs masons uniform
dont care about anything ben needs to come back
ok so ive calmed down and i think ben went to the locker room early for a brace or injection and did not expect to get the ball back it will be fine
id ben is out id want to see dobbs next week i thought he was better than rudolph
id rather lose this game than bring back ben if hes not 100 that being said pls be ok ben
a why does everyone think ben is done this game he went to the locker room early because there was only a minute left in the had and every minute counts when it comes to pain management

b i dunno if you guys are watching the rnfl game thread but so many people dont understand the rules on a false start
they just said that ben is coming back
big ben revenge tour incoming
it doesnt matter what the opponent record is steelers will almost always play close games win or lose
he doesnt even have a limp lets go
ben walking back onto the field
big ben what knee
bens angry cowboys dont like him when hes angry
minor injury ben about to take this game to the next level
looks like it was just a tweak no limp and hes not wearing a brace either thank god now lets stop being cute and put these cowgirls away
id rather have dobbs as the backup over mason at least you get a different look with a mobile qb
nice play by minkah there
minka gonna rip that dudes leg out
we are looking porous af
to be fair dallas is coming off of their 4th consecutive bye week
did romo just say you see the juicy ass
gilbert just stared death in the face there
this is the steelers defense huh getting torched by a 4th stringer from the aaf
how many steelers does it take to bring down a second string rb
this is the trap game isnt it
i dont want to see this d vs kc
we are literally lining lbs up in man coverage on wrs on the majority of plays not zone mismatches

their oline is doing a really good job
why arent they blitzing this guy every play and putting pressure on him hes a fourth stringer lets see him perform under pressure
cowboys are just playing a very clean game they had the one turnover but other than that nothing of significance i dont even think they have a penalty besides an offsetting one
we keep playing one too many linebackers
21 point second half incoming
bens comming out in a leather gimp suit
dont worry guys i changed sweatshirts
the steelers always start slow this season for whatever reason

we still got this
remember gimp ben is the best ben
td to tie it and then go from there
those 1 yard drag routes

what are they expecting there thats not even a short passing run game play
34 time for a long pass
i hate this fucking stadium going all the way back to super bowl 45 have we ever won here
what the actual fuck are these playcalls
another god damn 3 and out
3rd and 4 bomb
im in pain too ben im in pain too
does ben need to bring out the boot
well that drive was underwhelming as fuck
man i was hoping i could just chill do some cleaning and casually watch the game

but now i am glued and will be surprised if we can win this we look like garbage in every phase except special teams bc of boz fg and berry punting pretty good
has dallas punted yet maybe once
i am not having fun
this is what i thought derrick henry would do to us
wtf was that tackle
theyve already run for over 100 against us man i miss alualu and hilton
a field goal here ends it our offense has been so bad they wont overcome a 2 possession game
we are getting fucking embarrassed by a fourth string qb let that sink in guys we are also against one of the worst defenses in the league
this game is increasingly unpleasant to watch
get in his fucking way and make a god damn stop sutton
were so lucky that theyre just taking fgs and essentially keeping us in it
we aint deserve this one guys
shades of ryan mallet fucking kill me
even if we win this doesnt look good at all talk about getting exposed
dude even if we come back and winthis is fucking pathetic
ok ben gunslinger time
thank god mccarthy has no balls
why are they seemingly so consistently bad against teams with losing records what is up with this shit
dallas has had the ball 10 more minutes than the steelers so maybe maybe the steelers have 3 drives left i dont think they score on 2 of them
weve been relying on talent to bail out our dumbshit coordinators the past decade this is what happens
i honestly think its time to move on from ben the league has to many dynamic qbs if we had a justin herbert we could easily beat the cheifs our defense is just gassed from carrying us
claypool is a rookie but still you gotta catch those
juju is fucking money cash fucking money
choo choo smith schuster
ok juju

lets go
juju is putting this team on his back
juju better get the game ball this week
in juju we trust
defense please please please just stop dallas
jujus back baby
juju ate that drive you love to see it
all my friends hate 94 on the cowboys
nice call taking the penalty yards on the kickoff
those two points may come back to bite us
you cant really blame boz for that the long snapper was asleep at the wheel there
how is that not leverage
instead of 3 we need 7 again we love self imposed pressure
he jumped the long snapper what the actual fuck wheres the flag
he pushed off the snappers back what am i missing here why is there no flag
imagine blaming boz for that pat
imagine blowing out a team youre supposed to blow out ool
hope bos doesnt get his kickoff blocked
everyone on special teams needs to lose their jobs
fire danny smith
steelers putting the special in special teams
1 thing goes right 50 others go wrong lol
wow thats how you take the wind out of our sails
ok lets fucking pull it together now
gg steelers losing to pitiful cowgirls after beating almighty ravens week before who couldve predicted that
best defense
why are we getting killed by a fucking 26 team
dst is taking the week off
this is fucking crap
just kick it out of the endzone another points causes by the st
just quit now
could we not zoom in on someones eye
one team thinks they should win one team wants to win
why not just take the touchback
minkah you should have stayed in but fucking interception when we needed it
minkah fitzclutch
well at least we got the interception i guess
ben to juju for 97 theyre due
minkah is the best thing to happen to the steelers since big ben what a fucking impact he has had in one and a half years
jujus due for 95 yard td
we do good when i have the game offso do i turn it back on after that pick to watch
minkha was a neck gaiter guy even before covid og
ok time to prove their metal shake things off and put together a 98yard drive
it is mind boggling to me that nfl wide receivers drop passes right to them
might as well make ray ray the wr1
please gimme a 86 yarder to claypool or juju
wow really bens never had a 99 yard td drive deebo did that in one play
shout out to dallas for giving up every penalty possible this drive
eject him
guys im gonna stick my head up my ass and hide under my bed lemme know when were done thx
refs are doing their best for us
jim nantz has been consistently wrong jesus
no one blocking crawford man
pats are actually gonna cost us this game
could really use those two points right about now
wed be up right now if it wasnt for those damn meddling extra points
crawford made it across again lucky we got that fg off our special teams is straight trash right now
lets see if our defense can hold its a one point game with time left
my mom is a cowboys fan and shes being absolutely insufferable
steel curtain time not black and gold buttercream cupcake time
that papa johns ad just raised my cholesterol from looking at it
maybe on this drive the steelers wont play the swiss cheese zone and the cowboys cant pick up 15 yards at a time
that cheeseburger papadilla thing looks fucking vile
if there was ever a time for the d to force a 3 and out
this team is going to destroy my liver
defense getting another turnover here
remember the time the stillers make people have heart problems
1 stop please

lets go defense
come on ben defense did their job lets take this w

lfg
some respect for 99
finafuckinglly a stop
d did their job lets finish it
i am actively playing renegade steelers boys act accordingly
connor take an early flight home or something
really appreciating the clutch refball here
another lucky break for us
saved by the refs
roughing the passer for ben is this really happening
lmao this win is gonna feel like a loss
ebron thats a big guy to be hurdling people
too much time
welp up to you defense again lol
man now we arent gonna make our 25 point streak

s
i have faith in the defense i have faith in the defense maybe if we chant it it shall come true
alexa play renegade
now the defense will feast bud or tj will strip sack and seal the game
claypool needs some serious work on catching still
fuck way too obvious on that read big ben

we left too much time on the clock if our defense cant get it done here then thats it
hold em defense theyre one dimensional now
lets go defense
another int please
defense take my energy
after the catch is killing us
keith butler rn okay guys lets not change a damn thing soft zone no matter what
man we need tyson and hilton way more then anyone wants to admit
worst matchup of the season and somehow the most stressful game so far
keith butler is the guy you play in madden that runs cover 4 show 2 on every single down
its not a steelers game if we arent having heart attacks right
it aint over i still have faith in our defense
tj watt have my fuckin babies
this game took 10 years off my life
nice i knew this was a win the entire time
ez win no doubts whatsoever
this garret kid is tough though i can appreciate his game today
i am going to impregnate my wife with twins and name them cam and tj
so probably that should have been a horse collar
this fucking team lmao
championship teams always find a way
kicking the fg wouldve so much more beneficial
why dont you just kick a fg there
tomlin is a fucking idiot
what the fuck
kick the fucking field goal
why didnt we go for fgup by 8
waitwe didnt just kick the field goal
what the fuck i still dont understand not kicking a fg someone please explain
i mean i can understand maybe being hesitant to kick the fg given the fact that some guy just gets clean through right up the middle every single time but why is the alternative the slowestdeveloping running play in history

like randy i need you to queue up a run where we run horizontally 8 yards before trying to get upfield
idiotic not to take the fg there its almost like tomlin was butthurt that the play to claypool didnt work and he stubbornly stuck to his guns
you cant coach scared you have to trust your kicker and your blocking to make that kick to ice it
a field goal shouldve been the playcall
field goal wins game wtf
kick the fucking field goal fuck that reasoning romo gave
this game should be over
this week has been the longest year of my life
they forgo the opportunity to make it an 8 point game and then give up a thirty yard catch on first down jesus h christ
what was smart about not kicking the field goal
theyre just not gonna call false start on that rt are they
yeah you have the possibility of blocking the fg but also consider we cant run it on short downs
holy shit wheres the holding call
imagine if we were going to at worst case scenario go to ot if they scored a 2pt conversion
wheres the hold on tj
the most 2020 steelers finish
this is some major deja vu with two completely different quality of opponent lmao
no reason for this game to be this close
didnt we see this last week
lets fucking gooooo
andddddddd stillllllll undefeatedddd
minkah player of the game god damn thank you so much
same exact ending as last week why do they do this to us
god minkah you beautiful son of a bitch
being a steelers fan has literally taken years off my life
every game will end in a goal line pass bat down
minkah again that was ugly but beats the alternative 80
they said yall enjoyed the ravens ending wanna see us do it again
the most steelerest finish dishing out heart attacks and aneurysms

this team is keeping cardiologists open single handedly
team of destiny

the fact we have 0 points against this defense after a full quarter is super concerning
the fact some of you guys are saying trap game just shows we arent that good i dont give a shit you dont play this bad against a team thats 26 with their fourth stringer

this commercial is longer than any of our drives so far
rudolph is not the future shouldve traded for a vet to sit behind ben until we drafted his replacement mason cant read a defense to save his life throwing out routes and check downs doesnt win games
im not as worried of rudolph playing as i am about rudolph listening to randys play calling
well this all hinges on ben coming out or not

thats the game
see what happens when we dont drop dupree back in coverage
its pretty obvious now that alualu is missed massively
lets not act like the officials are the cause here peoplewe all knew this was going to happen
we couldve been up by 8 and it wouldnt have mattered if they scored a td dumbest decision of the season to not take the fg
our offense only does well when ben calls the shots please put randy on thin ice
guys guys hear me out i have magic doritos last week against the ravens we were doing shit until i started eating my delicious naco chips and our defense finally stepped up and we came back this week were doing garbage i grab my doritos in last resort and we score 2 td i wont let yall down
yall are some miserable motherfuckers
this is bad the steelers will never win another game in the history of their existence fire everyone and fold the franchise
holding defense

hey awesome

illegal formation offense

aw man
if ben isnt able to return do we make fire tomlin posts now or do we wait a few games


s
offense stop sucking

defense stop sucking

fucking dicks
im worried these commentators are gonna choke on dallass cock soon
was that not a tackle out of bounds
god i hate that this game has to come down to this but lets get it done an ugly win is still a win
i really dont want this to come down to the defense having to make a stop they havent all day dallas has moved the ball with ease and only stalled in the red zone again theyve punted once
this has to be the least fun 80 team to watch ever
also can romo not openly root for his old team that was terrible just a terrible as starting 26 how about them cowboys
captain fit fuck
ben lamar jackson roethlisberger
theres the obligatory double coverage long ball
calling a draw on 2nd and long should be a penalty
bro how do u drop that
mapletron gotta bring that one in through both his hands and he short armed it a little
this is gonna come down to the last possession in the 4th isnt it
good no call said no one ever

i really hope we dont make this 4th string qb look like brady
lets go defense make some plays
i feel like the steelers game themselves out of competition sometimes oh we watched last weeks footage so lets scheme like this to stop it never accounting for the other team to address weaknesses just come out and play standard steeler ball no gimmicks just normal schemes and force them to work around us now we just chase our tails this game should be an easy win and i think by the end of it we will all relax but these trap games are legit
nelson you gotta run towards zeke my guy you cant wait for him to run past the first down marker
whos surprised anyone
if we lose my friend whos a cowboys fan is gonna talk so much crap to me lol
i dont like the way this game feels
you cannot stop garrett gilbert you can only hope to contain him
hey this is our bye go easy now
theres the first of many sacks today
gilbert yelling at cooper already lol
run run pass punt
whats with all these run plays
great play calling lol
the spread worked all of last week and were back to shitty screens gotta love it
i think ill come back for the second half
some great play calling to start off
lets just let ben call plays again
god a 3 and out
shut up tony romo
its fucking ridiculous that we all knew theyd look like this and they still do
awful playcalling
fuck randy fichtner
lets get ben some empty sets and let him call the plays for a bit shall we
it feels like the steelers do this shit on purpose
from now on thats how you punt berry
love me a steelers screen on 3rd and 16 inhales and exhalesreminds me of home
screen run 2 yard pass i hate when we get cute
lmao i fucking knew as soon as cooper caught that first catch we were gonna lay an egg its alright well get it going
i know it gets said all the time but ben should really call the offensive plays with randy acting as an advisor this offense looks anemic at times
dude what the fuck how do we keep doing this shit year after fucking year
throw the ball past the chains and dont wait until 3rd down to try it
imagine thinking we can compete in a shootout with kc
lol this dude is a one read qb he should not be looking good
well that was a fucking awful quarter of course i expected the 70 steelers to beat a depleted cowboys team but so far we dont look like we want this game
imagine running on 2nd and long often enough that its a tendency that teams can prepare for

how is randy fitchner still in gainful employment
joe haden returning punts thats interesting
why haden
haden hm interesting
ah haden was back cause steelers had d on the field when cowboys made that late switch
you know its bad when we can so clearly tell that ben has taken over playcalling
i hope mcfarland is just gettin snaps because they want to

havent seen anything about conner
did we have haden catch a punt as a bit lol
where is connor wtf
why run it again
conner may have had the 1st down on the pass and would have gotten it twice on the runs
they need to just forget about draws why cant we put a blocker in the backfield
boswell was booting 60 yarders in warmups why are we not kicking this
if conner is hurt they havent said a damn thing yet
i swear all these crime shows are the same the commercials put me to sleep
is conner hurt
put a fullback in the fucking backfield you stupid cunts
thats fucking disgusting garbage
jesus christ wtf we had 5 straight completions and cant get a yard running it up the gut 3 times
hey you know how theyve stuffed every fucking draw lets run more draws someone hire a sniper to fucking ice randy please
andddd still no push
trap game
dude fuck fichtner
what the fuck
lol always playing down to a team that they should be massacring classic steelers
fichtner blows
fuck randy fichtner
3 draws for 1 yard lets do it again randy just let ben call the plays
99 is awful
it didnt work the first two fucking times so why the fuck did you run it the 3rd god someone needs smacked upside the head
of course mondeaux would fail
im shocked mondeaux let somebody run right past him shocked i tell you
getting ran on by a 5th string qb
are we playing against lamar
how are letting fucking garrett gilbert run the ball
if we could stop running the ball out of gun on obvious run playsthat would be great
we could stop lamar from running but not gabbert
we always suck against the cowboys no matter how bad they are and its infuriating
why cant we play full games ever
missing hilton so much
i see we have decided to play to our opponents level today
99 is the worst player on our team
with reaction times like that tj watt might have a career in drag racing after football
pathetic absolutely fucking embarrassing
can we all double check that we are doing the same gameday traditions that we did last week one of you is fucking up our win karma
ok were far enough into this game that im starting to get worried
i knew the steelers would underestimate garrett gilbert
mahomes is going to fuck us into oblivion
bruh the false start was obvious there
lmaooo and now we have to climb out of a hole
our offense is consistently measurably worse when fichtner is calling plays than when ben is doing it at the line how much longer do we need to see it for
im so embarrassed rn
lmao tj watt on lamb big brain butler
this istruly pathetic
false start x2
trap game trap game
do not put tj on a wide receiver
our secondary is bad bad
lmao its expected offense non existent for 8 quarters now and and the defense getting embarrassed by a fourth string qb
why is watt in coverage so much every time he is in coverage the edge is never set
well done boys somehow making the cowboys look like the undefeated team

truly impressive how we can fuck this up even by steeler standards
make him beat us with his arm
puts a de on ceedee lamb
i had low hopes coming into this game third road game after tenbal bad team had trap all over it

but didnt think itd be this bad
this is such a fucking joke every steelers fan whos been watching this team for the last decade knew this shit was coming every analyst who hasnt that 135 made sense this is fuckin disgraceful
time for some more predictable plays hell yea
just once id like this team to just absolutely destroy another team i dont care that were 70 we are not better than the chiefs if our offense cant be consistent enough especially if we meet kansas in the playoffs
run run pass
this has to be a joke
thank god for the block in the back
great offensive gameplan i mean truly what a fucking great job by this coaching staff to prepare this 70 team against a 26 one
guys if we already lost just leave the gdt lol
falcons fan here is it okay if i cheer for yall today since i dont care for the cowboys and their millions of bandwagon fans like lebron james and other celebs that are only fans of theirs because of the cowboys 1990s teams
brosthis is straight up bad lmfao
that was a great play by dallas no matter what you want to say that was a ballsy call
yeah this is headed in a very wrong direction steelers are literally not winning a single part of the game
cowboys playing like its 2016 steelers playing like its 2019
i warned you all that we would blow this

we are
the standart is the standart
lol this is the cowboys super bowl and the steelers are still in the locker room
why cant every game be like the cleveland game last month
just need a ben turnover to end the half
we arent gonna score this half
the secondary is not communicating at all

they didnt pass that off 2 guys go with the 1 receiver
ray ray return td manifesting it
man i never thought id say this but at least with todd fucking haley this offense could put up points get rid of randy let ben call the plays this is said almost every fucking damn week this is absolutely pathetic that this offense continues to do jack shit in the first half of games fuck off
everyone needs to step the fuck up
open up the steelers offense stop being so conservative
nice stadium design lets put huge gaps in the building to blind the players with the sun
can someone smarter than me explain why ben doesnt just no huddle the offense all game

fichtner is so uninspiring as a play caller
we dont play down to teams thats just a myth
fichtner needs to be on the unemployment line how does he keep this job with anemic performances every single week
we need the absolute hell beat out of us if we want to be competitive whatsoever later in the seasonplayoffs this team is way too complacent
this instrumental version of the show must go on by queen is actually pretty awesome
this is fucking embarrassing even if we come back and win this game this seriously hurts our reputation since its on national television
only passing plays from now on please
dj looks like ab out there with his quick shimmy cuts
now we are picking up some steam is ben calling the plays now
sometimes i think ben and randy dont even talk before games
deep breaths guys its still early and were holding them to 3s on mistakes have faith
were never going to get a flag today are we
so first half play calling has been shit again
hurt ben activated
defensive pi and roughing the passer on back to back plays fuck these refs
the hilarious reality that i would take onelegged ben over mason or duck 1010 times
the need to go to shotgun might save this drive
i see some urgency with that big ben hit
everyone worried about ben must not have seen him play injured hes gonna put up 500 yards and 5 tds
hurt ben is the best ben
there we go think the injury woke up the team honestly
i think they gave ben that eskimo water from the waterboy
steelers had all of bens lower body joints replaced by bionic parts years ago

youll never convince me otherwise
fuck even boswells sucks today
what the fuuuuck boswell
this game is fucked
everything sucks
hurt ben is best ben
you choose now boz
the defense is not the problem 10 points in a half not counting the 3 that came from a botched st effort you take that

the offense scoring 6 in 29 minutes fucking problem
now shut up
was ben calling the plays on that drive
get the injury boot of doom
oops boz
jesus christ boswell
of course he misses the extra point
boz bb wyd
ben will be ight
id take a loss go to 71 with ben rather than go 80 and not have ben
fuck the fucking cowboys
pour some tussin on it let it get into the knee
fuck lets hope its nothing serious that hit ben took looked bad
that missed extra point has officially retired the killer bs
i dont understand why we dont let ben cook weve been moving when he throws cowboys are stopping the run
come ooooon that miss is fucking huge
bring out the boot
ps and ts ben is alright i cant watch mason play qb again
boswell too used to shaping his shots to account for wind at outdoor stadiums
thats disappointing but boswell has been absolute money this whole year just how the ball has been rolling today its not our day
welcome to the trap game enjoy your stay
i think ben is really hurt this time guys
fuck here comes rudolph
tony romo should not be allowed to call a cowboys game
minkah fitzpatrick
fuck i hope rudolph has a redemption
ill shit my pants if rudolph scores
damn wish we had ben this drive
captain fat fuck we need you
glad our defense is always there to make big plays
i missed those 15yd per attempt from rudolph
i just got back to the tv why is mason in the game
oh my god i dont miss last year
an offset penalty is a win for dallas it chews 20 seconds off the clock and just results in a mulligan
run the ball and timeout holy shit this pass is gonna get extended to 0
glad dallas called that timeout think it would have been delay of game
why is pittsburghs backup worse than the guy dallas signed this week
mason rudolph looking like mason rudolph
if ben is out that extra point could have been huge
boz god please
just a dumb low percentage play with an awful qb why not just get sure yardage running the ball
make this and you are forgiven for the extra point miss sir
i wish this was like wwe and the lights went off and ben came back out by gawd thats big bens music
redemption time boz
i just came back from dinner to see rudolph tanking like its 2019 somebody please fill me in
boswell looks like hes in 10th grade
does mason rudolph not have any arm strength 38 year old ben has more zip on his throws then mason does
are we icing our own kicker
nailed it yes boz
bosgod works in mysterious ways
bozgawd
lets fucking go boz
boswell taketh and boswell giveth also fuck our first half game plan
bosgod fucks
bosgod i never doubted you
lets fucking go 59 yarder
that was a fucking perfect kick congrats boz
this is why you dont mail it in and take weeks off players get hurt
i forgive you boz
boswell makes up for that missed extra point
thats why hes the goat the gooat
why not hail mary
boz god
what a kick hell yeah boz
boswell
at least ben got some extra time in the locker room
the wizard of boz

praise be
bosgod giveth bosgod taketh away but mostly giveth
wait i thought it was illegal to leap the oline on a fg
i like to thing the false start was on purpose
haha rewarded for being terrible
the velocity on mason rudolphs throws is alarming
cam wanted to boost bozs confidence with the false start to make him kick a harder one thats a true leader right there
ben can have both of my knees for all i care just please be ok
i really dont want to watch lame ass rudolph for the second half sure hope ben is able to come back or we just do wildcat plays or somethingidk
i can not do another round of mason rudolph
why does rudolph only float passes just bullet it
yo im at the game any update on ben
stop dooming guys
heart attack half coming up baby here we go
he said just like 5g it just got real
not even a brace on large benjamin
ben will be back
hes walking back out
the commentators during the half time show just said ben will start the second half and just tweaked his knee
ben likes to be dramatic
ben is the toughest qb in the league that man is a tank
x200b

x200b

ben iced up his knee and is good to go
come on defense get us a stop
i didnt think tyson was such big part last week and this week showing he is
i really enjoyed the first 7 games this one not so much
bruh if i see 99 in on one more play i swear to god
3rd and long please just play it safe and drop everyone into coverage
so no adjustments during halftime surprising
i hope fichtner is out here taking notes because outside runs work better than inside runs
just shit my pants
ok boys gut check time
there is a lot of time left to flip this game around stay positive
what are we doing where is our defense how the hell is dallas with a third string moving the chains
i feel like were locked in on featuring diontae today
we are so ass lol
maybe well wake up in the 4th quarter once were down by two possessions
another 3 and out

ben gets tagged again
i am straight up not having a good time
where the fuck is our line jesus we are swiss cheese letting them fuck up ben
yeah theyre gonna lose to this trash ass team like wtf
lol damn av
i am so fucking sick of those plays on third and less than 5
i feel like maybe we just go for the first down there
check down is wide open and ben decides to sail it fifty yards into double coverage
berry the best player on the field for the steelers so far
i told you ol is garbage today
is randy calling the plays again
just dont see us winning this one were not there today
manifesting that they play renegade in side att
ol is getting beat in the trenches ben not getting enough time to work i guess the titansravens games back to back have taken a toll on them
the whining in here is extra special this week the team is on its third straight road game and had a week 4 bye we just need one big play to switch momentum
3rd and 4 you say theyll be expecting the short playhail mary
can we force a 3 and out for once
even if we win this game the media is gonna trash ben
wtaf
can we get one 3 and out
man it would be nice if we could stop them
cant wait to sleep the next two weeks on the bengals and jaguars too
completely outcoached
they about to pop out a fumble
very considerate of the defense to give ben plenty of time to rest
were beat up tired and on our third straight road game all of this shows
this game hurts us bad no matter what this is crazy
noone has shown up today

just a piece of cake for dallas
im beginning to think this defense is suspect
this team feels different in a bad way since the titans game im hoping this is just a rough patch and they right it by the end of the season

id be okay with losing against the cowboys if we can figure it out by the thanksgiving game
i cant recall a time that weve looked this weak on both sides of the ball just cant get anything going our way
their oline is playing really well sadly
watt and spilane on lambfire butler
they play like fucking pussies omg
make a fucking stop
its really cool that we keep lining lbs up to cover their extremely talented wrs
10 years later and mike tomlin vs mike mccarthy in this building is still not a good thing
im disgusted by how little pressure weve been able to generate they have backup fucking linemen
how many times do you guys think keith butler is gonna put linebackers on receivers im thinking 60 billion times
blitz on every play not like they got much to lose at this point
dunno how you go from top 3 defense in the league to what looks like bottom 5 in one week
we make lamar struggle but gilbert grape is tearing us apart
our cheeks are getting clapped by a 4th string aaf qb
literally just whiffing on tackles absolutely unacceptable
son of a bitch
what a flat performance these guys walked in too cocky
score on our next possession or this is done
death by a thousand cuts
tip to butler figure out man mismatches if youre too stupid to then stop running man coverage every play
this shit is embarrassing maybe it lights a fire and we stop being so fucking complacent
we need to dink and dunk the fuck out no more deep shots because ben cant hit those
this is your reminder that gilbert was used as a corner to cover amari cooper in practice and were making this scrub look like joe namath
psh we got this
lads im not feeling good about this one
terrible coaching on both sides what a joke such an embarrassment
why does a 10 point deficit seem insurmountable right now
idk if i can have any faith left if this drive isnt a td
20 yards biggest gain so far damn
there you go juju
lead us to victory daddy schuster
i keep saying it and no one ever agrees but juju is our best wr
when all else fails juju is the answer
i love juju so much so fucking clutch when we need him
claypool you gotta make these fucking catches
we absolutely need to extend juju the dude does exactly what we need him to when it matters
jujuhines ward 20
juju smith schusterrr
injured ben dangerous ben
juju you demon lets go
x200b

touchdown steelers

x200b

juju smithschuster
and the mail in ballots are coming in
juju saving this fucking game what a player pay him all the moneys
theres the steelers i was expecting
lets go juju
pump fake td the ben special
fuckin love you juju
juju ben boswell and washington are the only ones who wanna win apparently lol
juju should be getting at least 15 passes thrown to him every single game makes no sense that he doesnt
god damn it canaday
juju built different
should have went for 2 smh
canaday is dog shit
outclassed in special teams today
lol man wtf
are you fucking kidding me
thats insane wtf should be down by 2
i have no words
canaday wanna block
special teams bad
juju for touchdowns
my opponent in fantasy this week has bosgod so i have that going for me
it should be 1917
oh for fucks sake
how is that legal
idk why their special teams is blowing through our line so far this game
they are making up for no fans with twice the ads

d is gonna get a 3 and out and well score another td
how are people blaming boz for that lol
danny smith is gonna be chewing a few extra pieces of gum over the next week special teams has been atrocious tonight
special teams have been trash
boswell needs to learn how to tackle from pat mcaffee
just getting murdered on special teams
you cant make this shit up
this is so deflating
of fucking course
steelers havent done a damn thing right all game
heads need to fucking roll if we lose this no excuse
from here on out just kick the ball out of bounds its clear this squad is outclassed on special teams
wtf is this game i want to believe we are sb caliber and then we do shit like this
tomlin needs to clear house at the coordinator level all three are holding this team back
can our defense fucking do anything

i go to feed my dogs super quick after we get a blocked extra point again and they are knocking on the door of the red zone

holy shit were gonna fucking blow this huh
what the hell happened to our run defense
special teams has cost us 2pts and 2 great returns
this game is so deflating tom brady is getting a 4 game suspension
did we finally play a good team lol
coaches are so bad
2 special team plays completely fucked us
lol undrafted rookie free agent shutting down this defense
its obvious that were missing bush anyone know if williamson is active
how is our defense shitting the bed against one of the worst offenses in the league lead by a fucking fourth string qb in his first start wtaf
minkah
lets fucking goooo we needed that
well 90 yards to take the lead

98 yards to victory
but he could take a knee right
have they called a single penalty on dallas that has mattered
now we have to score we cant stop dallas at all on offense and we need to force them to throw or something but even that feels hard
thats our first round pick
dont do that dont give me hope
thank god for fitzburgh
im sure randys playcalling will be perfectly reasonable on this drive
i liked what minkah did there only because hes proven to house call consistently hes got the ed reed greenlight
tony romo is so hard for the cowboys
big ben fuck it diontae down there somewhere
we have to make a statement with this drive
a lot of people here forget how many games bradys won by 3 points on trips to superbowls
saved by the fucking flag
i love refball
wow we got saved
eject the bastard
well thats 2 calls that went our way lol
get ejected
what the actual fuck is this game
this is too much stress from a 26 team where do i file a complaint
wtf is nantz talking about
damn im sick of romo
youd think tony still plays for the cowboys
it actually wasnt that bad he was trying to push away his hand but from the other angle it looked like he was going for body
is miami good at playing football


or is miami bad at playing football
that azmiami game looks like a banger
every snap announcer try to guess what bens doing and is wrong every time jus shut up dude
gotta go for it since they arent calling the leaping shit
im surprised how off the o is today
half quarter to go also known as an eighth to go
alright down one lets get a stop and win this game d
one or both of those extra points woulda been mighty useful
this is where our d has to make a play and not after dallas goes into our redzone
time to put the clamps on em boys
block fucking crawford how the fuck is he consistently jumping over
thank you holy fuck
aight d had time to recoup lets get a stand here
come on defense we need you to get that ball 1 more time
defense gonna have to come up with some more magic
this is the drive the defense can dictate what conversation were all having this week
lets go defense
oooooooh he said redskins
make em punt once guys
i would have never expected us to only have 1 sack at this point in the game
can the run d just look like it did two weeks ago for one drive one drive
finally mondeaux
the mandeauxlorian finally did something
boswell fg to win it
this is only their second punt
lol second punt of the game from a fourth string qb
i wanna watch the game so bad but every time i turn it on bad shit happens
if we get a td we should go for 2 right
this game has taken years off my life but we are in good position to pull it out
the luckiest flag ever
again the flag coming in clutch
holy shit the zebras are practically handing this to pittsburgh but also fuck you dallas for taking cheap shots at our quarterback
hit the qb in the head and its always been a penalty
i absolutely hate that rule but it is in fact a penalty and ill take it
holy shit what a lucky break those first three plays were trash
its crazy the refs have to help a team thats 70 against a team thats 25 mindblown
that boy diontae moves like jelly on a sunday morning
you want the td here
a lot of time left on the clock
hahahaha oh shit ebron
leap frog ebron
mario jumping sound
go for it
ebron is my best friend
big boy ebron
lets goooooooooo thats typical steeler football right here
that fucking hurdle
ebron
hopefully that doesnt bite us in the ass
alright defense its now or never
too much time dont trust anyone right now
gotta scheme juju open there today is not claypools day
bababooey
dallas had 3 timeouts its not like we were going to run that whole time off
x200b

roethlisberger has over 300 yards 3 tds and 0 interceptions
lol getting ptsd from 2016
anyone else just laughing hysterically about this game
mondeauxs play cant be overstated
my heart bro
claypool needs to hit the jugs machine tomorrow im no nfl receiver but i think he needs to catch some of those
p u c k e r t i m e
also watching this and the miaarz game side by side has been a trip
weve played with fire to much this year
couldnt give us a break this week has to be a nail biter its the steeler way
anyone else getting mad annoyed by tonights commentary or is it just me
they have 3 great receivers dont gamble on pressure too much focus on stopping their receivers cam and tuitt can get pressure on their own theyve got 3 timeouts still they dont have to just go to the sideline
wasnt there a meme earlier in the week that basically called this
billcowherletsgogif
anyone want to meet at the doctors tomorrow
blitz him every snap
god shit joe
game saving play by haden
one more stop
heyward and tuitt
this play decided the game lets go
fucking finally
letsss gooooo cammmmm mmmyyy mannnnnn
lfgggggggggggggg
i hope i wasnt the only one playing renegade
cammmmmm goat of sacks and false starts
cam mf hayden
cammmmmmmm
steel fucking curtain
steel curtain baby
i fucking love cam
renegade
every fucking week
shut your fat mouth mccarthy
r e n a g a d e
i love this team but holy shit im getting gray hair because of them and im only 21
i knew we would win this game this is normal steeler football
ahhhh i got it now fichtner sets us up with horrible playcslling in first halves so this team gets used to working from behind for wins i see whats going on here
i feel like heyward is our best closer watt is awesome but i feel heyward is the most likely to make the huge play on the last drive
imagine the dread of a 5th string qb getting spun around by cam heyward into a tj watt sack
does anyone know a sub where i can do a prehealth checkin before watching games just want to make sure i dont have a heart attack before the next one

thank you dallas for winning this for us
this and last weeks game have been too stressful for my ass
what was that
what the fuck kick the field goal and win
holy shit that was dumb
why didnt we just kick a field goal there
why not kick the damn fg
i dont know about that i woulda liked an eight point game
that was dumb
hahahahahaha i want to fucking die
if we were gonna go for it then why not take a timeout and carefully come up with a play
not only no field goal but we go to the side wtf
i love connor but that play with him is retired would literally rather throw it
i cant believe mike did that what a total and complete idiot stupid fuck
going for it seemed really dumb and then after losing 3 yards i realized it was really dumb
theres been horrible examples of end of game time management all year i didnt expect tomlin to provide one kick the field goal
i dont get it
just kick the fg go up 8 let them score 6 and the 2 pt conversion that was the dumbest call in a long time
sunday and praying thanks steelers for always keeping me right on this day of the week
imma chew yall out about taking shit on tomlin in the post game thread watch
we should have iced this game twice
come on d just pick it off and end this nightmare game
not kicking the fg was the dumbest thing
remember when we blew out the browns
missed holding call
tomlin is great for tv ratings keeps other teams in the game until the very end ill give him that
just like last week can we do it twice probably not
i dont agree at all with romo take the points and go up by 8 you at least buy yourself room with the need for a 2 pt conversion
omega hold on tj
how do they not see holding on tj watt almost every play
these last three games have been appropriate for the steelers as they induce heart attacks
watt in the full nelson
juju looking like bart simpson on the bench
minkah
minkah again
eight and zero
lets gooo
we need to learn how to play better in the first half we are causing ourselves so much problems but good win
80
jesus fucking christ i cant do this every week
this game literally took years off my life
we almost lost to aaf legend garret gilbert
another minkah save
doctor woke me up after my heart attacks 80
cowboys make one play and everyone already believes all hope is gone im out see you guys after the steelers win
now to watch the steelers turn their qb into tom brady
ben thought he could take an off day calling plays but randy proves hes too incompetent for even dallas
the standard is the standard we dont prepare for teams with losing records and things of that nature obviously
mason rudolph is not the future
i cant do another half season of rudolph i just cant
i think juju jinxed this game he posted a tiktok of him dancing on the star before the game
here comes fucking garrett marino again
alualu come back bb
how can juju have all this energy with all his tik toking
what this game is truly about romo
why are you the way you are steelers
butler is calling one of the worst games from a dc that ive ever seen just zero adjustments an absolute fucking clown our coordinators are
romo really been sucking the boys dick today and its been annoying
they jumped again
can steelers please score a td so we dont have to see another fg attempt
if they can stop the ravens in this situation they should be able to stop the cowboys
claypools hands looking like clay bricks
so is this another character building game i think its time to really address the inability to play a full 60 min game itll catch up to us some game
mason rudolph was ranked 3232 of qbs last year and we still refuse to find a replacement
reports coming in that the cowboys are demanding the refs stop the count and not count any further touchdowns theyre officially declaring victory
at least biden won
also all of you hating on tomlin this first drive fuck out of here
damn 1 drive on each side and already bitching about tomlin

yall are something else lol
oh no were losing by three fire tomlin we suck sooo bad
this was the most predictable game in steelers history
i dont think this is shocking anyone coming off a game against baltimore always playing down to competition classic steelers really
hire todd haley
the two top teams in the afc got a little turbulence today
really hope we arent stuck with rudolph after ben retires
i feel like rudolph isnt even that bad its fitchners bum play calling that really puts this team in bad spots
ben expected to return for second half per lauten
defense looking like shit rn
this defense will miss dupree
good work d you finally stopped a fourth string qb

well stopped him from getting a td
a deep ball on 3rd and 4
hey guys our number 1 defense hasnt forced a 3 and out today
smith shuster is washed some clown
why did he take that out
im so sick of diontae dancing stick your fucking foot in the ground and go upfield

why not kick the fg make it an 8 point game why would you trust the offense and even going for it why run a fucking counter my god
imma need a bump of cocaine to come down off this game yall

man fuck the colts cant get shit done that interception call that went for the ravens was a terrible call incomplete pass
i dare these mfers to give alex smith cpoy over my guy
damn colts shit the bed
kinda pulling for the panthers to come out on top against kc so we can be consensus 1
plz dont play down steelers
im still nervous
i am very nervous unsure why

lets be honest we all know why
how can the cowboys win today just be the 1975 bears

thanks tony
ben best rb in afc north
bruh fuck the deep ball
i hate the deep sideline passes
boy are they excited about dicks

we know
there was contact but that went right through claypools hands
little hold still gotta catch it with hands on it
claypool should have caught that
i am mentally preparing myself for this to be a stressful game but i expect us to destroy expect the best prepare for the worst
still dont care for the dive and draw plays over and over again but relax guys lol this isnt a big deal yet at all
so the defense needs a timeout in the first quarter against the cowboys ps offense fuck
yes hit him low and toss him across the first well done
i didnt know we needed alualu so badly
wow what an effin joke williams was held so obviously and no flags
yall the cowboys are excited and we arent give it some time
wow alualu really mustve been that important
so this might end up being that game
i guess they show up and play the second half this week
were looking like dogshit so far lmao
yeah i guess i will crack open a beer
this guy reminds me of brandon weeden
great coverage bince
whats on the back of inces arms
can we get this redzone d the whole game please
now block the fg lol
no td for you
tj just a hair away from causing that fumble
thank fuck for tj watt
why doesnt that stadium have blindsshades for those windows
i understand everyone here wants us to demolish cowboys wo giving out any points but we just have to accept the fact that we rarely blow out anyone
even if they only got three that is a good drive for dallas and a good start to the game for them they chewed up a lot of clock time and came away with points dallas loses the game if they let roethlisberger control it but if they can keep this a low scoring slow paced game that keeps the clock moving they have a shot
yall acting like we are losing 400
wtf is this conservative bullshit
just gotta say when i first tuned in i was like why the fuck are steelers in black and gold then i remembered dallass home colors are white then i felt like a huge dumbass
16 yds to go lets throw it behind the line of scrimmage smh
what in the fuck
lmao what is this offense these last several games didnt look good 2nd half of titans was only ok last week now this i know its early but it looks just as bad
that punt was dope
our oc is no better than our punter
2nd and 14 hand the ball to our 2nd string rb fucking lol
good fuckin punt tho
these plays are fucking garbage whats with these piss ass short throws and rushing on 2nd and 14
worst playcalling ever wtf was that
wow berry looks much better although the dome probably helps
clutch punt
lads im getting some ruff vibes here
hey ben you want to start calling plays again maybe have dobbs draw up some ones youd like too
benny snell runs on 2nd and 10 and 2nd and 24

neither of those play calls is defensible and both end up with a punt after a failed 3rd and long
our offensive coordinator is the issue and its not even a debate
berry holy damn bro
not the best play calling
great play calling so far
lmfao just lmfao ive seen this shit before
i stand by my previous statement we do not have an intermediate passing game
i dont feel like we are taking this team seriously
looks like this is play like ass first half and play fucking amazing second half kind of game
defense take my energy
i feel like randy wants to start every game bad on purpose
it seems i prematurely shit talked berry
this is 100 the start of the game i expected so im not even mad
this is why ive been nervous about this game tomlin coached steeler teams against shit teams is always an adventure its only 30 so not a lot of panic yet but man if it isnt trending towards it
out of all the games this is one i shouldnt have to be stressed about
jesus fucking christ whos calling the offense today big bens 7 year old son
everyone freaking out until we get a turnover on d real quick
the defense rn is like oh so its going to be one of those games
bens deep balls just havnt been there we dont have a deep threat id much rather take ben over anyone but man it sucks not to have it in our arsenal
honestly garbage playcalling by randy so far i have faith itll shape up
id like a pick 6 here please
gilbert throws better than lamar
if im mccarthy i go for this you win this game by taking risks
garret peyton tom dan marino brady manning gilbert
so when do we just promote ben to oc
they would have had it kind of dumb not to go for it
tomlin we purposefully looked like shit in the first quarter

checkmate cowboys
fichtner fans will say weve scored 25 in every game this year without acknowledging the fact that his specialty is 2 yard runs and screen passes
joe haden as the return man interesting
the play calling in that quarter sucked
haden for pr what
did something happen to ray ray
where is ray ray
anyone got any insight why would haden be returning the punt rayrays okay right
steelers vs cowboys and fichtner
why the fuck was haden back there lmao
if im 26 theres no chance in hell im punting right there thanks dallas
i think its pretty clear at this point that the steelers are feeling out what the cowboys are capable of on both sides of the ball they are giving very simple vanilla looks on offense and defense and the steelers simply havent turned up the volume yet when we start seeing more creative looks then im sure the momentum will swing almost immediately i agree with the majority of the sub that we should in fact be coming out swinging but quite simply put we are still in the drivers seat ride the wave well be fine
damn you guys see johnson burn diggs
mcfarland looks like the emoji in that picture
haden probably is the returner when they go safe or are trying to be ready for a fake he used to occasionally practice with the return team when we were at uf probably got the job by default
3rd and short time to throw it over the mountains
stop running the ball pls
as a former terp

mcfarland is only 58 what the fuck
jesus christ fuck off with this stupid ass play call
im guessing conner is hurt
wheres conner lol
just terrible play calling today
this is so fucking embarrassing
theres 0 urgancy from our sideline just playing backups playing down to our competition its so sad man
randy fitchner go fuck yourself
update from my last comment three consecutive runs with no gain after passing works randy is calling plays again guys
why are we so hell bent on running the fucking ball
running game isnt working at all better run it on 4th down
ben goes 66 and we run it 3 times in a row
fire randy fichtner now i swear
we ran the same play twice what are we doing
mondeux needs to wrap up
a run up the middle didnt work the first time lets try it again
99 is a bum
wtf are we doing
fichtner maybe if we run it up the middle three times itll get two fucking yards no fuck
1 fuck snell


2 where are the fucking holding calls
wtf come on 3 shots to gain like a yard and youre running the same play 3 straight times nice
why cant we ever look like the better team against anyone
i usually talk about playcalling as well but the ol has been fucking garbage in the run today
mondeaux being on the field at all is a great of telling your opponent you have no real interest in winning the game
we do not look like the better team right now
lmao
ben take over playcalling again please
fire randy sphincter
fuck this shit
fichnter holds this offense back so much
this gameplan is maddening
insert do something meme here
i still have hope but daaaamn we cant do 4 quarters of offense or defense
maybe they realize were playing a football game next drive
good to see we overlooked the cowboys
can we play like an undefeated team for once
butler take tj watt out of coverage you fucking idiot
guess i shouldve started the dallas defense in fantasy
take mondeaux off the field please
mondeaux needs to go back to golden corral
this is a coaching issue were obviously the far superior team and yet were playing exactly how they want us to
lmao you truly have to laugh
chiefs can handle the jets easily but when it comes to us we look embarrassing we arent winning a super bowl
this is embarrassingly embarrassing
time to unleash hell
ill check in on this after halftime maybe ben will send randy packing by then
maybe well do the opposite of what we usually do and instead give heart attacks in the first half and play mediocre before smashing 24 points past them in the 4th quarter
dallas barely had 10 in their last 3 games

lol
that was pathetic
why the f was watt on lamb
wow
sucks that out talent bails out shitty coordinators
how the hell do we drop 8 and leave him that open in the end zone
great refereeing refs go fuck yourselves
can we not put out best pass rusher in coverage covering their best receiver
christ im having a melt down already
please tell me more about garrett such a cinderella story
the worst start all season wow
why do we insist on dropping tj watt in coverage on 3rd down
i trust we will win the game but this looks pretty fucking bad
steelers just love playing down to their competition dont they
no way we lose to these fucking bums
do any of you understand zone defense
just so so disappointed that we still show up completely unprepared for these games ive really got to give up expecting us to get over it
this team is why i have trust issues
score here quick stop score again before the end of the half
gah our offensive playcalling just blows so much so hard to get momentum when we are doing shit like running on 2nd and 14 and giving up on drives passing 2 yards on 3rd and long
in a way im actually glad this is happening because now theyll stop using their trash run plays and just pass the damn thing or get creative i mean he cant just keep running hb dives right

right
does butler not trust his corners to call man coverage getting out coached big time
i think everyone is over reacting were still gonna win like we did against the ravens
i am not surprised in the slightest bit
how do you people make it through games being this emotional lmfao
stevie wonder could see this coming
man defense to actually make gilbert throw people open nah linebackers on receivers again
we def didnt take this team seriously
conner was okay this whole time and we didnt use him fucking once last drive
how bout we start playing different personnel they got a receiver on a lbpass rusher almost every play tj has 3 coverage snaps alone already lets just go to nickel or even bring in a dime backer and play with a bear front and stop dropping our outside backers in coverage other than flats at least for a while
youre telling me conner was healthy and had nothing to do with the last drive wha in the fuck are they doing
five wide call the play at the line lets go
i love the steelers

however i hate randy fitchner
lol will you guys calm down theres a reason we play all 60 minutes
so randy are we going to continue the run run pass
actual good punt by berry and that happens anyways
cant blame the coaches for the execution on some of these plays
imagine what the chiefs will do to us
still a 50 yard play at least
this is the super bowl for the cowboys
pathetic
i put the game on 5 mins ago and its already infuriating come tf on theyre 26 for a reason
dont worry guys ill turn off my tv and well get going im taking this one for the team
im not even mad this is laughable i think well be fine 2nd half as per tradition
slow starts mean bad prep for the week coaching issue not player issue for sure
hmm cant tell which team is 70
not surprising at all been like this for years
like 5 blocks in the back glad they chose one
cowboys might as wel go for it we cant stop them
mike tomlin special coming up
anyone freaking out yet or is it still too early
whats the point of having watt practice all week just to fucking pull him he came on the plane it just makes no sense
eagles held them to 9 and washington held them to 3
i would kill to have competent coordinators watching other teams coach well every week is frustrating
this team has always been so nonchalant with lesser teams shit is ridiculous
brah i am not having a good time right now
the way this game is going is so eerily similar to the 2014 game against the 18 jets we go down like 13 or 170 in the first quarter and a half and go on to lose 2013 im having extreme dejavu
stop running the fucking ball the oline cant do it your running backs cant do it just stop fucking doing it

running on first and second down and not getting a first down is a losing gameplan
i know this is going to sound stupid but could playing towards those giant stupid fucking windows with the sun glaring directly into the players faces be playing a part in our piss poor performance so far or is it poor play calling and execution
this drive has to end in a td
looks like im getting fucking sloshed
run through the air were good at that
good shit juju
juju looking like hines ward on that one
ben get drunk before the game
lmao ben is so mad
am i the only one that thinks ben calls the plays everytime we are able to move the ball decently
bens deep ball is so trash so far this year
big ben needs to fix up on these long shots ffs
its crazy that i expected dallas refs to call the pi
steelers vs refs
there is this clear delineation between playcalling interesting
lol these refs are pieces of shit
wheres that guy who made that mason rudolph coming in
today thread fuck that guy
bens staying in thankfully please dont let this year get any worse
x200b

well it is halftime ben can put some ice on that kneee and come back better than ever
i swear to god yall
ben is hobbling

why is he still in there
injections for ben incoming at halftime
im willing to donate any body part ben needs i cannot watch rudolph again
ben shake that shit offfff
take ben out wtf i rather lose this game than lose ben for four games or the season
damn ben threw that with some anger lol
chase bailed him out there lol
ebron might be my favorite offseason addition this year
hurt ben has entered the game dallas is fucked
wouldnt it be great if did this all game
i count two penalties that the refs missed against the cowgirls
bionic ben is best ben
gimpy ben td pass
all my homies love james washington
theyve activated bens trap card
ben is king
yessirr
thats my qb
if half injured ben just the thing this team needs
bens pump fake still elite after all these years
legendary pump fake
missed pat srsly
ok

so it takes ben to get smashed and his left knee fucked to get serious

and then there is the boz
and he missed the pat this is swimming in fucking headaches
oh boz god cmon man
now that is a lunch pail guy
are you fucking serious
alright back on track a little
ben is washed up pull him
ben might not be able to throw deep right now but he can manage a drive when he calls the plays
worst half of the season by far wow
but were still not out of this just yet
oh boz
god fucking damn it
i love my drama king ben
wtf boz
one of those games probably gonna come off of the foot of boswell to end the game and redeem that missed xp
ben in pain is a focused ben now time for the d to wake up steelers are only a picksix from a tie
wow top to bottom theres some disappointment definitely one of those games when bos is missing the xp
i just hope this means a second half of banged up ben

hes next level when hes hurt a little
wouldnt say no to a pick 6 before the half
an injured big ben is better than a healthy big ben
why can we not just play well
watch it again kids not on boz
who knows if it was boswell or if jordan berry messed up the hold
release the red zone reindeer
this game isnt over its not gonna surprise me if they bring it back like they always do but goddamnit is this so frustrating that they do this shit all the time against teams they should not be losing to
people sleep on ben as a football mind hes not just backyard ben this is somebody who knows the game and has truly developed
nice throw to get the td but that dallas defender literally held claypools jersey for 6 or 7 steps before tackling him down totally missed call blown by the ref
its so predictable defense is swiss cheese until the red zone offense is terrible until ben starts calling play at 2 mins left
i just constantly flip my opinions with this defense i mean ben being potentially hurt means the d will need the win the game but can they they gave up 13 points to a 4th string qb but on the other side have dominated some games i cant read this d
i think theyre just using the extra time to get him in there and evaluate i think ben is good
i still love me some bos he only had one bad season for us and every kicker is bound to miss here and there
lol oh no here we go with mason
just kick it now lol
rudolph elite lets go
rudolph pls bro
lol ben come back please
i know rudolph is higher on the depth chart but did we ever decide if he was better than duck
1 what a defence

2 lets go rudolph the redzone reindeer
im over here like mason is fine but i still dont think hes our future
just get a field goal pls just get a field goal
its absurd the cowboys are allowed to get away with those windows
masons floaters gonna get our receivers killed
turnover great

mason not great
not mason rudolph jesus
mason throws passes that get our wr murdered
thank you juju for coming down with that
so lucky for juju
i thought we were done with this clown
shit got barely 1 play
why is mason in the game
they couldnt get 5 yards with mason
wonder if randy is gonna bust out the samuels conner wildcat duo

things are already going pretty terribly
imagine if we went after andy dalton as a backup
tf was that god mason sucks
lots of whacky shit in this game but the fact that the steelers cant run the ball against one of the worst run defenses in the league is the most ridiculous
isnt it easier to kick in a fucking dome
damn yall must be some new fans
fuck it go for the 59 yarder
bosgod
praise becam heyward
whaaaaaaaaat
ok boswell youre forgiven for that missed extra point lol
not to take credit but i sent him my energy so youre welcome boys
boz redemption
bahahahaha he made it lolololol
bosgod again
wowwww holy shit boz
and totally redeem yourself
cmon ben
new career high
ok 4 point game ideally ben comes back in the 2nd half leads us to a comeback and we get out of here 80
bozgod with the boomer
atta boy bozzy
misses extra point
makes 60 years fg
false start op les go
we needed one good thing to take to the locker room and thats boz making a 59 yard kick his bitch
thats my bosgod
bos is like ben i guess lol miss the 54 but nails the 59 by a lot lol
can you now use the snapper as leverage i feel like that happened both attempts unless i saw wrong looked like he used our guys to jump up the middle
what happened to ben i missed the game up until now
i miss charlie batch every year as he set the standard for backups he is only 2 years older than brady wonder what he is doing
burt says ben is expected to return
ben expected to returnpraise his knee
lets calm down about ben if ben was in danger of missing time i dont think he would have stayed out there
love that coach still has faith in his team even after all this time
please be okay ben
ben expected to return per dve
im too drunk to know what to expect so someone tell me how to feel rn
roboben revenge tour incoming
i think we bring more blitz pressure in the second half
so glad bens coming back but the steelers gotta atleast make dobbs qb2 after that showing
ben if you win this ill promise to stop referring to you as the two time
we gotta get into nickel too many wrs covered by lbs
gilbert looks like steve young out there compared to maon
this brady guy is pretty good
we are getting killed in the secondary
gilbert is picking us apart
bro garret fucking gilbert is bending us over the fucking barrel what is this
watt blew that one
the offense has been rough but the defense today is far more disappointing for me
a sack would be cool
idk what evil spell the city of baltimore has put on his but our run d has been trash since then
so yea our defense as of the bush injury or second half of the titans game has not been the same
sure we ended up with wins but havent played well down to down
good to see they made absolutely zero adjustments at halftime getting absolutely fucking dunked on by a 4th string qb
fg miss would be nice
im glad their kicker is automatic this game
dupree out here likesame old shit shit just a different day day

out here tryna get it get it each and every way way
i still fail to understand why we run base against 11 personnel especially when they have pollard in not that hes bad just more of a change of pace than a run you over guy
need a new plan offensively whatever we had coming in isnt working
just saying slay the spire and celeste are on crazy good deals on ps4 and theyre pretty relaxing to play while watching games on my phone especially slay the spire if anyones looking for a fun game for multitasking
lol them saying lets see what ben looks like after the injury we already saw what he looks like 44 and a td so dramatic
im stuck outside away from the tv whats the update on ben
the blocking on that reverse play was trash at best
berry is booming the ball today
our d is going to have to win it for us again
just take the yardage needed for the first down were down one score we dont need a home run
this o line aint getting isotoners for christmas
our offense collectively has low t they need some of that gel you rub on your shoulder
al pounce decastro chuks idk what the fuck yall are doing but it needs to end here
i feel like im in the twilight zone as much as i know this teams performance in these games i said no way not this game and here we are
need defense to step up for us please
defense splash play to save the day coming i can feel it
wtf happened to this run defense
this run defense is a joke what the fuck happened
come the fuck on
poor tackling
best run d in the league right there
almost no pressure on their qb
tj getting that cock punch fist ready
we have got to tackle
what is life if not to lose trap games
we cant stop garrett gilbert garrett gilbert is unstoppable garrett gilbert
this guy picks apart our secondary like tom brady
this is just complete trash on defense remember when the steelers used to eat rookies and first time qbs
gtfo out of zone
getting torched by a 4th string qb
whats that yet another fucking lb in man coverage on a god damn fucking wr
that clocks just cruising away
1st down tfl
2nd down make it 3rd short
3rd down easily give up a 1st

rinse and repeat
so were just not gonna make a stop this drive
hurt cam is out here playing better than our whole dline
watching these defense and im feeling like ive never seen these guys before
feels like one play we put our foot on the gas and the next we take it completely off and start pumping the brakes

getting whiplash over here
i guess we arent the 1 run d anymore
defense sucks dick until these fucks are already in fg range
dont give me that ol bullshit sutton
fucking dog shit
tomlin cant beat teams with losing records
why must they always do this shit every fucking year
this is weak so far plenty of time left
greg zuerlein is dad dicking our 70 team
we have time
only 10 points but what a miserable fucking game

the defense and offense need to come to life and stay alive these little jolts of life before going limp is clearly not getting the job done expected us to phone it in today but this is ridiculous
still plenty of game left i believe
just shut up romo
hard to blame our defense when our offense cant stay on the field two weeks in a row where our offense is virtually nonexistent and our defense suffers for it having to stay on the field for a long time with little breathers in between
lol cant wait to see a 50 yard bomb on 3rd and 1
wont be the first time tomlins been out coached by mccarthy its easier to understand with aaron rodgers at qb though
can we play offense already we cant give garbage teams hope you know cowboy fans will never shut up about this one 4ever
steelersdepotthe steelers are 64 as doubledigit road favorites under mike tomlin per pro football ref last loss was to raiders in 2018 xray machine gate

64 when you are big favorite is not good
fellas we cant lose today and give mr big chest the satisfaction
more shortintermediate passing please
got to catch that
juju is the only bright spot in this game
juju lets goooo
protect juju at all costs
juju got the hot hand feed him
now can we have bionic ben tear this shitty defense up
juju
thank you juju
jujuuuuuu
juuujuuuuuu

i love juju
pick 6 lfg
not boswells fault but why take the personal foul yardage on the kickoff thats nearly guaranteed touchback help the guy kick the extra point
bruh wtf is happening
hahahahahahahahahahaha
why the fuck not
looked like he was running out of bounds
cut everyone on special teams tomorrow
jesus christ all three phases are brutal today wake up call
i think the specials teams is a little bit of a problem again
danny smith needs to go
why can we not stop them
i look away for one second
elite special teams today
our special teams arent very special
already in the red zone
lol danny smith just knows how to ruin my day
stop playing goddamn zone defense
our special teams have been an absolute strength this season and today they decided to shit the bed wtf

our defense is legitimately unrecognizable today
this game is all about momentum and we keep fucking losing it every time we get some
this whole team has been playing shit
just do a touchback
we deserve a loss here
juju why did you dance on their logo before the game seriously a lot of this seems downright unlucky

aint gonna shit on my team love these guys but im over here like
mmmmm idk he looked like he stepped out there
only win if we get a turnover just no mojo today on d
fuck this game lol
this bandaid rushing defense is so bad man theyre gonna get toasted for another 200 yards today
pretty much everything has gone wrong today so
where did our defense go
i swear if we find a way to lose to this fucking hs jv team im done
heads need to fucking rolll on monday
14 point favorites i knew that was a stupid line
here i am thinking were gonna win 343 today

minkah you beauty
half the distance from the 2 lol
lets gooooo hyped for the pick but wished minkah just took a knee
ok well shit


lets fucking goooooooooooooo
big time play right there
98 yards to go boys
incoming safety


what else did hell have in store for us
fucktinyromo
stay in the endzone you fuck
dont run it out
a pick is a pick
minkah clutch as hell
lol ill take that penalty
whooooo thought we were getting robbed
pass run pass i mean lets try it
he keeps it a one score game and runs it out and yall bitch calm down either way we needed that badly
minkah needs to go the fuck down why running out of the endzone just 20 yards out of the window

but glad we have that beautiful safety
really surprised they let gilbert throw in that spot a fg is a 7 point lead
time for a 90 yard juju td
12 minute touchdown drive ez
my fucking heart im gonna die
i dont even know how you call hitting a dude in his chest a blind side block
lets just go ahead and win this fucker
diontae has a shitty catch radius
everytime i look up its 3rd down
for the love of god stop passing to johnson
ray ray save the day day
thank fuck ben took over the play calling
its uncle ben time
never had a 99 yard drive


didnt he throw a 99 yard pass to juju
if they are gonna keep giving us these 56 yd passes keep taking them
snipsnap snipsnap
every time i turn it off the steelers do something good so im leaving the game off youre welcome
yo he just straight punched him
haha nice composure dickhead
i like claypools fire but getting involved in every altercation is going to lead to a penalty on us at some point
cant believe we need the refs to win this
of course romo wants to go down and protect his lil cowboy
cowboys been buttering the ball during changeovers
bad take on tony acting love or macfarland was holding his facemask am was pushing him off so thats dumb
i think the refs feel bad for us
holy fuck
tie game oh wait
good going chris
please fire danny smith crawford has ran the same play 3 times and he hasnt stopped it
we desperately need a real running game
lets go defense
im fine the unnecessary roughness call but to act like he shouldve been ejected goes against the sport of football
strip sack comming up spillane easy
somebody want to stop that guy from getting home on every kick attempt or what
thank god this was a touchback
tj unleashed
see yall at the hospital
make a fucking stop
this dallas offensive line of backups has out performed the steelers dl and ol
all that just to give up the first in a sec
great stop mondomondu
brett fakesel makes a play
how come zeke only looks good against the steelers
i swear some of yinz are so pessimistic
all things considered gilbert is playing well today
come on ben you got this
clutch ben time
thats what we needed

offense needs to put points on the board and torch the fucking clock
big ups to romo for the blazing saddles reference
some say nantz is still saying their punters last name
slow drive for a td would be greaaaaat
did ben and boswell bet against the spread or something lmao
i need a t shirt with mondeaux in a print like the mountain dew logo
bold prediction were gonna come out in 5 wide formation
steeler heart attack football
this is four down territory until we get to the 20
cmon ben lets go offense lets prove were 1
everyone play renegade
lets go offense
so special teams our achilles heel
this game
his feet cant catch
how many drops does claypool have today
bens throws have not been good today a lot of lowhighbehind receivers
thank you refs omg
why have we abandoned the run
we are getting bailed out by the refs
finally call it
ref does not want us to lose
i am shocked they called that for ben
3 great playcalls randy thanks for the call refs
bailed out nice
tomlin looks like hes about to lose his goddamn mind
i hate that call but ill take it lol
yesss i love refball
if we win this it will be almost entirely as a result of the variety of penalties dallas has accumulated
so many drops
thats a garbage call right going backward and flails his arms super weak
cowboys sub must be up in flames right now
were gonna take a lot of heat for being bailed out by flags
feels like ages since we ran the ball
thats allll in
and the mail in ballots put us on top
thats a heck of a lot of time to leave hopefully the d can pull through
thank god get this two and then d play your asses off

well fuck still i like our chances to prevent them from scoring a td defense will ball their asses off as long as butler doesnt go full retard on the play calling
jumped right over that lil gnome
lets fucking go
ebron baby
ee ee eeeeebron
leapbron
nice hurdle how often do you see a hurdle for td
too much time left they needed to waste it
everyone blast renagade right now
pump renegade into my dick veins
im sorry i ever doubted this team im sorry
my fucking heart is not enjoying this
blast renegade
so this has gotta be a record for least amount of extra point conversions right
we need to go to juju in those situations man
cutting the zone coverage like butter come on now
anyone else have heart palpitations today lol
we never do things the easy way
a lot of you guys are way behind
the last thing i wanted this game to come to is a defensive hold they only punted 2 times
everyone have renegade on standby
lets go defense
ok time for tj to get some
any chance we can like maybe not do this against the jags and bengals
maybe dallas will just kick a field goal
i miss guys like rod woodson carnell lake and troy polamalu
lets go defense
give me either a defensive td or at least a turnover forced fumble by tj or bud or an int by minkah
it should be 2719 right now the blocked xp and missed xp is hurting so bad right now
gimme that sweet sweet strip sack
a w is a w ill take staying unbeaten over anything but damn this should never have been close

a damn 4th stringer

and now a flag fest going against the cowboys where my cowboys fan coworkers are texting me they helping the steelers refs vs cowboys and shit
fuck me catch that
think you guys have it tough im the only steelers fan in my house while everyone loves the cowboys
lets go defense lets go
punt it you cowards
clutch haden

cam motherfucking heyward
letsss goooo the comeback
calm down its not over yet we need a 1st down
wdkoswimamqkqwkwowoooooooooo
this is the way
im sending my cardiologists bill to mike tomlin
the win is gonna make us forget that our secondary is bad and the run game is like i dont even know
gilbert fucked cams wife i can clearly see that now
the secondary needs to step up next week though with cincinnati coming off a bye their worst starting receiver is aj green at this point which is saying something
ball game
we got away with one there big non call on heyward
cam is that man
god this game is so good
hats off to gilbert kids a gamer

that being said here we go i never doubted them looks around nervously
lets go offense
wtf just kick the fg
just take the fg there wtf
why the fuck didnt they kick
kick the fucking field goal
wait why didnt we kick a fg
why would you not go for the fg
should have taken the points tbh
uhhhhh just kick the fg wtf
no fg what the fuck
wtf go up 8 omg
romo is 100 on point here cant risk a block as st has been ass cheeks
if we lose someone deserves to be out of a job
why not kick
why did we not kick that fg
thats on coaching

why would they not kick it am i missing something
there is no reason to not take three there
i feel uneasy about not attempting the field goal there
that may have been the dumbest play in the existence of football
im in shock at how dumb of a call that was
why the fuck does this happen every god damn week
so that fg call kinda of makes sense theyve been close to blocking just about every kick lol
goddamn the fucking lovehate relationship i have with this team
there is so much fucking wrong with this team
its like want to lose this game
tony is so fucking biased holy fuck
please d please youve been called countless times but we need more more
ok why does conner look like his dog died is it because we couldnt run against the worst run defense in the league
what the flying fuck was that decision not to take the field goal i dont care how shaky boswell has been we are giving them a chance to win this game
someone tell me why we didnt kick the fg
is this a replay of last week
honestly if im them i feel pretty good about gilbert after this game
well it comes to one play just like last game
not this situation again my heart cannot take more of these
please d your name is called once more
lets go defense
here comes the heart attack
dont believe they didnt take the field goal
i am so scared lets get an int
how do you miss that chokehold on watt
good lord i dont need this in my life right now
even if we win this has been pathetic
end it with a sack come on
lets go defense
jesus h christ
thank u minkah
thats the ball game
fucked that cursed stadium get the squad and get out of there
another week another heart attack
80 babyyyyyyy
80
holy shit i cant keep doing this every week
mad respect for gilbert 80 baby
steelers football baby
this team is going to kill me
wheeeeeeew that was too close shouldnt have been that close to begin with
ben is all of us lol
and of course its minkah
thank god the nfl ratings arent chosen by a committee
minkah does it again
10 hart attacks how bout yall
team of destiny or using up all our luck
140 bpm
i love this fucking team best start in franchise history
we lose this game any other year holy shit
first time ever 80 ugly as yo sister but still a w
fuckk all you sorry ass fans doubting boz and then praising him a second later
gotta love how tomlin and butler get exposed by other teams lining receivers on our linebackers going on 5 years now no corrections
trap game engaged initiate maximum steelering i see us winning by a field goal the steelers are out to kill off all older pennsylvanians
steelers absolutely deserve to lose this game
alright motherfuckers lets do this

80 its go time i want a good clean game and i want our boys to get pulled in the 4th

who ride
why do we have to waste a to every 1st quarter
you guys just attract negative energy
we look bad guys
watt in coverage on lamb brilliant
this team is so talented but has the worst coordinators
tj on a wr what could go wrong
this game has been so predictable of course the steelers play like shit after beating a good team always play down to the opponent
nothing like a long commercial to remind ya how much things suck right now due to the ongoing global pandemic that amazon is making record breaking profits from

thanks amazon you fucking suck
fichtner is a plague on that offense the difference between bens play calling and his is night and day fire that man tomlin he is killing your team
woke up from my mom texting and asking me if the steelers were undefeated and i knew something was up
hopefully ben is just get a pain shot and will rest up and be out there in 3
goddamn itthat play should have never happened if it werent for the non call on pi on claypool
does rudolph hire people to come on here and defend him

hes obviously one of the worst qbs in the league
did romo just say juicy ass
lol butler is really an idiot bud dupree on cooper really lmao
im just straight up not having a good time
well if we hold em for three then a touchdown ties it

offense needs to be on this second half these flat performances are killing us
getting outcoached on defense trying to stay in base in 3 wr sets then dupree is covering amari cooper
any given sunday its a one score game lets get the w here we go
they may as well go for it we cant stop shit
steelers and playing down horribly name a more iconic duo
idk how i thought we were super bowl bound
alright guys heres where the momentum shifts touchdown here defensive stop another touchdown
chill its the first quarter

chill its only halfway thru the second

chill its only halftime

chill theres still a quarter left you are here

chill ben has a great 2 minute drill
fine free play but come on ben please do better make it a jump ball at least
ah yes 1st and 15 from a 1st and 5 delightful
our special teams is straight ass
we have to keep juju and bud at any cost idc how you get it done just get it done
well it was nice to go 70 had to end sometime
god we needed that biweek
this is gonna be one of those games where the score makes it look closer than it actually was
down at the 2 lord give me strength
hes usually a great announcer but romos homerism is getting on my nerves also bc were losing lol
imagine having 2 extra points
okay at some fucking point you gotta just stand up and not let these dudes jump over the line
mondo only pawn in game of life
i dont want to be negative but man i really wanted to run and keep the clock going down
we all know this is coming down to the last play its the pittsburgh way
calling it 300 yard second half for ben
why are we letting a 5th string fucking keep this alive
guess we just dont get any pi calls this year

this has to be the trappiest of all trap games
defense wakes up when theyre already in a position to score lol
i can tell by the first drive with two bombs thrown when we never throw it deep that we overlooked this team lol
hire todd haley
playing down to the competition the mike tomlin special
conner wouldve gotten that first down
you wouldnt think this was a sub of a 70 team just from reading it lol
death taxes and playing down to a trash team
the chin would be foaming and spraying spit all over players by now
offense better wake up this upcoming drive
thank god this half went by fast and is almost over
what an interesting commercial
its like they remembered ben can throw the ball
good things happen when you throw who would have thought
im going to start sending my cardiology exams and blood pressure bills to the rooneys and steelers front office
we are so much better in spread and ben calling plays
where the fuck has this offense been and why isnt it ran more
please dont be acl
most pittsburgh first half ive ever seen
lmao rudolph is awful would be nice to have a competent backup qb to buy some time if ben can come back
incredible from sutton man hes so good it feels like he always shines and gives us a spark when everything is dark it sucks they get the ball to start but i hope we found what we needed to clean this game up
overall terrible halfbut were right back into it
ben ill give you my knee if you want its kind of fat but its young
losing to the cowboys and keeping ben safe would hurt but i think making sure hes healthy is more important than trying to go 160
i dont understand why we tend to make backups look like brady is it cause the other coach tries to keep it simple and we plan for difficult i dont understand i guess dallas doesnt have much to lose either
this offense is so fucking bad cant move the ball or score on the worst defense in the league
can tomlin try to wake this fucking team up or is he just gonna continue to stand there and say nothing ffs
the steelers offensive line cratering this year has been the biggest issue on this team full stop
3rd and 4 lets chuck it
fuck this offensive line theyre awful
bens deep ball looks like trash this year get fucked randy terrible play calls for yet another 3 and out
cant understand it why going for bombs on situations like that man we are in a lot of trouble
3rd and 9 so dallas will get 10
so who else have the cowboys beat just so i know what company well be a part of
come on boys it aint over til lizzo sings
how did it not occur to ebron that he couldve been holding there
pay juju after this drive
that type of shit is exactly how you lose these type of games
im talking to the supreme court right now about massive extra point fraud
maybe go for 2 next time
fire danny smith
fire danny smith
fire danny fraud smith
we are the imposter
just fucking down it in the endzone god damn
shouldnt have ran it out but thats just being pessimistic hell yeah minkah
hindsight is 2020 but i want minkah running that bitch out 1010 times
swear vander esch punched him
fuck outta here lve you fucking injuryprone neckpad wearing bitch
vander esch probably still pissed about the election
eject him
if he threw a punch eject his ass
i know dj isnt the biggest guy but he picks up like 2 more yards there if he just keeps running
refs gonna ever call leverage
does anyone else get worried about boswell getting mental issues whenever he misses a kick his fault or not
pittsburgh finally flipped
this is the unit i want out there to win it for us lets go d
im scared u guys
pick six time
dont stop the count
i know tomlin won you a super bowl and everything and still kept you winless but honestly what the fuck was that call not to put the kicker in
ha you fools captain fat fuck plays better injured
id rather have david decastro be the backup qb than mason rudolph
stop calling it gimpy you motherfucker
fuck you jim nantz
also why why why do we always go for it all on third down we needed 2 fucking yards ben cant throw deep but keeps doing it we have maybe 3 possessions left at this rate
i predict we only lose 453 to kc
imagine only having 9 points against the worse defense in the nfl
bionic ben has returned

im sorry but mason just isnt the guy wish theyd realize that
waaaaahhhh my favorite team didnt do everything perfectly the season is over
lfg steelers
well ravens and chiefs are going to win
rivers is so bad
lets just take care of business and hope for no injuries
please dont let this be a trap game
3127 ugly win but still a win
i hate that this feels like a trap game
lets get this dub man
hate when were forced to wear our black jerseys on the road fuckin cowboys
walk in yo trap take over yo trap lets go steelers take over the cowboys stadium
let this mike tomlin coty campaign continue
favorite wing flavors thinking about making some korean wings at halftime
expectation blow them out let mason play in the fourth reality every game gotta be sweaty
one job panthers you had one job today
fuckk it started snowing here gotta go fire up the plow i guess this is a radio game fml pray for me the first plowable snow of the season
ok boys hopefully this is one we can just sit back and enjoy
alright romo lets keep this unbiased eh
tony had to get a little ravens dick suck in they really should have lost to the ravens
is this three weeks in a row with romo in the booth
outstanding analysis there romo isnt every defenses goal to be like the 1985 bears
giants fan here pls fuck the cowboys in the ass so hard that they tremble in fear when u guys play in the future
lamar jackson who
rampaging rhino rumbles downfield
is that lamar
dad speed
speedy ben
rumbling ben
rumblin
ben realizing the nfl rushing title is still in play
like a fridge falling off the back of a truck at high speed
romo just hates ben
and they say lamar is the better runner
lets not do that ben
man thats way too risky wtf
holy pickable ball
gunslinger ben baby
fuck claypool you gotta catch that
claypool wtf
lets throw a low percentage pass to kill our drive
great throw ben
mapletron probably shoulda had that though despite the hold
no flag though looked like big holding
jesus berry is ass
um no call there
thats def a foul
shouldve come down with that but also shouldve been a flag
im conflicted i want former longhorn qb garrett gilbert to succeed but i want the steelers d to play well
cmon chase
wtf was that though the offense had momentum then 2 deep shots outta nowhere claypool shoulda had a touchdown anyways but odd calls
gilbert is going to be the next goat and it starts with this game lol
ok ready to see the defense dominate
i hope zeke doesnt have a good day
i really want to know what our success rate is against the pass on third down that has to be a low number im sure of it
need to welcome this gilbert guy with a sack
lol everyone can calm down
we should take a deep breath lol it will be fine
we dont concern ourselves with opening drive touchdowns and things of that nature
start choppin at that ball elliot is known to fumble
damn were really out here making the cowboys look better than the ravens
so our run defense just went out the door last week
its like the defense doesnt ever want to play for a full game
im less worried about gilbert as i am about our run defense rn
that was dang good coverage vince
high smith baby
ok ok ok
bince
did zeke lose 1015 pounds
highsmith is looking realllly good
nice held em to a fg
i dont think theyre gonna score in the red zone on us theres no space
chill people
at least the sack streak continues thats 65 consecutive games
nothing to see here just some early game steelering
the steelers are the 1 seed in my heart every year
vanilla playcalling
steelering is back on the menu
shit playcalling so far
now this is a good looking offense
ok this playcalling is not doing it
alright lets quit with this lax ass offense it gets annoying
someone wanna tell fitchner its not preseason
2nd and 14 run to bleh snell 3rd and long a 2 yard out screen pass

back on the fire fitchner train
ah my steelers
hell of a punt holy shit 57 yards
if you dont love this you dont love steelers football
ok berry ok
oh boy randy fichtner makes me real frustrated lol
shaping up to be classic tomlin road game against a bad opponent
hell of a punt by berry
did the oc not watch tape on the cowboys
what a punt
jordan berry the goat
sadge
two absolutely tired starts for this offense what is going on
hopefully were only doing this to lure them into a false sense of security
can someone explain why punters dont audible to a pass when the gunner is left unmarked
running on 2nd and 14 is peak offense
running on 2nd and 14 i just cannot believe it
back to our regularly scheduled programming of steelering
why is it that every time we play a historically bad defense we always looks like total shit
i smell a pick6
is this a trap game i thought that was supposed to be the bengals game
aint nothing tuitt
still 144 left in the first and im on beer 3 steelering
i would enjoy winning this game just so tomlin can already have his 14th season as hc posting no losing record
1st q 74 offensive yards for dallas 25 for pittsburgh
lol check out haden being a pr love the versatility of the defense playing special teams
good shit joe
haden
that was definitely not part of the plan whats going on with our sideline
whats wrong with rayray
ok that looks like a ben play
i dont think i want starters returning punts
joe haden
lets go mapletron
the crowd sounds like theyre rooting for us
there you go cc
atta boy juju
ring the bell
love the check down to rb there
go for it
god we really just cant beat up on bad teams
rushings just not doing it
run game aint there right now
i heard that the cowboys have the worst run defense
why tf are we struggling
steelers doing what mccarthy shouldve done youre a two td underdog and 26 with a fourth string qb you win this game by keeping roethlisberger off the field that might require risks but what do you have to lose
wheres connor
where is james conner
are we playing a ton of backups its the only explanation for what im seeing
strange to use our scatback in short yardage situations
what a fucking joke
embarassing
yikes
they really cant get a yard running the ball this is sad
where the fuck is conner
why run that in shotgun
cant run against a terrible dallas d fucking lol
run 3 draws in a row lol
this team fucking sucks against bad teams plain and simple what a terrible fucking call

this team needs to wake the fuck up christ
fucking fichtner
cool cool fucking cool
how fucking stupid can you be
whats the point of having a fb if you dont use him
why is the smallest dude running on 4th and 1
only the 70 steelers could make the cowboys look like a competent team
you gotta be fucking kidding me same play call
not giving that to conner huh
in the fucking shotgun without a fb when you need a half yard love it
playing down to competition absolutely no one couldve thought of this
theyre a fucking professional football team too you know you cannot play this absurdly fucking stupid and expect to beat them just because theyre 26
another fucking draw are you fucking kidding me this is all you came up with after that time out randy just go ahead and fire yourself
shitshow
and an uncalled facemask
mondeaux is ass lol
stop running the ball
i still dont know why monduex is playing on this 5 star defense makes us look weak on his side
bless watt
fucking play the game jesus christ
what the fuck are we doing
look they have the number 32 run defense and we cant run it on them for fucks sake
gilbert running on us better than lamar did last week
99 sucks
lol we are letting gilbert run on us more than lamar
lol what the fuck is happening
pittsburgh what the fuck are you doing
gilbert has more yards scrambling than our whole offense
steve fucking young out here guys
we all knew this would happen fucking steelers
i wish we wouldve traded for a dt instead of lb
what is going on
mondueax so fucking slow and out of position tries to swap sides and gives that free scramble
team has clearly come into the game without the right mindset they thought it would be a cakewalk
dallas using the baltimore strategy run the fucking qb
god this sucks to watch
randy fichtners useless ass is going to single handedly be the thing that costs this team a sb run
this is not looking good
gilbert on the run after realizing watts not on containment
were gonna go into the half with the score being 06 arent we
what is going on with our defense
did the steelers even get on the plane for this game
let ben call it already jesus
im not stressed about the game as a whole but this is absolutely unacceptable if we want to be taken seriously we need to be able to play to our potential
i thought it was just a coach that had covid

whole team seems to have it
move the ball downfield with ease by passing only to lose it by running the ball
we could use a turnover
lets hold to a field goal please
this is pathetic
guys good news i think all the pre scripted randy fitchner drives are all over
lmao definitely looks like the typical steelers trap game
you just have to assume we wouldnt be able to slow down the elite talent that is jim gilbert or bob or whatever his name is
tomlin on the sideline while losing
making gilbert look like hes an mvp candidate
overreacting
whos this trash long haired white guy we have
lmaooooo this is pathetic why put ourselves in this position
steelers steelering nature is healing
defense looks clueless out there
time for a tranquilizer
what the actual fuck
were getting cooked no oil or butter
what the fuck is happening rn
so we arent defending the pass at all now or
we have two more rookies on bad teams coming up in the next two weeks time to turn things up and make a statement for the rest of the game rookies standing in the pocket and fearlessly making throws is not the image we need bring on the pressure and tight coverage we gotta keep people afraid of this defense
what the fuck
wow i cant even
time to get absurdly hammered
wtf is happening
wrong team scored a touchdown
take it easy well be alright
defense needs to make some adjustments we are shooting ourselves in the foot
such is life
im just as surprised as yall are
not sure why theres always an open receiver what is up with our coverage choices

our defense will adapt so im not worried yet just some questionable choices so far
this game fucking sucks
fack
of course they break their no touchdown streak on us
what the fuck
i think we all had a feeling that we would be playing down to them to some degree today
we got this relax
welcome to steelering dumbasses
how does the secondary have such an insane drop off from last year
seriously zone coverage isnt working play to your strengths
x200b

why are the steelers making the cowbys look like a decent team are the steelers intentionally stooping to their level

this is pittsburgh steelers football beat the ravens then get our asses kicked by some 26 team with a randy qb
gilbert has 4 more rushing yards then we do as a team 28 be 24
watt in coverage on ceedee lamb haden slipped on his turn around to the sideline

thats tough
alright boys you fucking awake now
im not stressing this is a classic steeler slow start but they never arent frustrating as moving away from pittsburgh and realizing that the pittsburgh left aint a thing anywhere else
that was their first td in 3 weeks they have already scored more this half than in their last 2 games combined
is conner hurt where is he
lol i love how we knew this was gonna happen
i hate being able to predict the future
this team isnt winning shit with watt vince covering wr and screen passes or run plays on 2ndlong

ffs were losing by 10 against the worst defense in the nfl and a qb who hasnt played in 2 years and elliot isnt even playing well
remember when pittsburgh was down 177 last week in baltimore everyone should chill out they adjusted in the second half and played better
well lets hope butler doesnt vince williams on keenan allen like last year where he just kept doing it all game


i dont think ive seen watt on a wr all year
butler and fichner cant gameplan their way out of a paper bag
chinga tu madre 30 veces keith buttler
god we get it garret was on a practice squad you dont have to say it everytime he fucking does anything
i wanted to believe the days of playing down to the opponent were over

god i hate being fucking wrong
they managed to snag a qb off a local high school team so we gotta tip our cap to that postgame interview
the steelers receivers posted tiktoks dancing around on the field instead of warming up
not that our defense is playing to their standard but this offensive showing is just sooooooo bad both playcalling and execution
run screen pass deep throw punt
no intensity at all in defense blitz like you always do on offense stop running it every play jeez open up the field
well hopefully being down 10 makes us start throwing more
pain
last thing we want is a stupid romo report who even let this clown call a cowboys game
well pull this out i believe just romo needs to stop filating his old team for 5 seconds
once again the problem is that the offense is absolutely useless and cant hold onto the ball for more than a few minutes the defense is gassed

the offense needs sustained drives for us to win
hello offense you there yo
so conner could have played that 4th down
anyone saying the game is over obviously hasnt been watching this year sure butler is terrible but once the players start checking down on what theyre seeing on the field well start a takeover
run run pass what the fuck
lol we suck
yeah

offense is a big ass problem
are you fucking kidding me what is this stupid ass play calling
i didnt remember ordering another run run pass
worst defense in the league and we cant get a first down
the fuck is this shit playing like we dont give a damn
offense looking just like last week in the first half
oh my fucking god stop running plays that will get 5 yards at most
we have the best wr core weve ever had and a hog qb throw the ball
jesus christ tomlin grow a fucking pair stop wearing the defense down to the fucking ground
the steelers have never gone 80 in 1978 we went 70 bottom line lets find a way to win this game still
block in the back
outstanding play calling and execution

we now need a freaking turnover against awful dallas
what the fuck just happened
roethlisberger looks like shit
jesus fucking christ

run run pass go fuck yourself fichtner
what
oh man
our special teams coach would never be this smart instead we got haden returning punts to throw them off lmao
i mean lol on that special team play but i kind of wish that would become a trend make punts a little more exciting
this is unbelievable
are you fucking with me
this team is so poorly coached
they fell for that high school harry shit
time to wake up boys
i knew this was gonna be the game where we do this bullshit
danny smith is a useless cunt
what on earth is going on
dont worry guys were still going to win this game well hit our rhythm
we got lucky this bum slipped
once the field flips and out offense and defense dont have the sun in their eyes then things will turn around
fuck keith butler
there is still a second half hopefully we adjust
not so excited to see our offense trot back out
only 2 score game still just i would feel a bit more confident if we had 1 score in the first half against these
welp if youre gonna lose a game its best to lose a game that doesnt really have any affect on the conference or division i suppose better get some points on this drive
canada needs to be oc idk who needs to call the plays on defense but it shouldnt be butler but at least he they only got a field goal
how fucking bright is that flashlight
supposedly this dallas d is historically bad yet they look like the 85 bears
my tennessee vols were up 130 at the half last night lost 2413 keep the faith lol
this would be a disappointing and heartbreaking start if it werent so damn predictable for the steelers to play down to a 26 team with a 4th string qb
why cant we have nice things
in a 2 possession game on a steelers team that typically makes the required adjustments at half i think everyone needs to chill out
long commercial
wake up offense lets get some points before the next half
absolutely no fucking way yall want todd haley back lmaoo
look for whatever reason we cant get our offense going if im fichtner get ebron involved start by throwing the ball to the middle of the field and build some momentum
open this fucking playbook call out all the shots we are in survival mode
oh thats right we have receivers
oh were throwing the ball now
getting so much more yardage passing it so watch go back to running three in a row
randy ficthner has to go as oc demote the man back to qb coach or something
oh wow looks like ben is directing the offense what a shock that things immediately start clicking
let ben call the plays

its obvious from last week and so far today that they need to let him make the calls

im tired of screaming at the tv my dogs are hidinglol
he overthrew him by 5 yards

this game is a fucking disaster
just not on the same page on deep balls throughout most of the year
if that ball is catchable its pi
oh shit right on bens leg
youre good ben walk it off
lmao tackled before the ball hit the ground okay
this is fine
so uhremind me who our back ups are for qb
injured ben best ben
honestly just lose this game but dont you dare lose ben
bad getting worse with ben holding his knee
holy fuck how was that not penalty for a low hit
ben is honestly a warrior wtf
wow what a grab
hurt ben is best ben
alright can we start beating the christ out of dallas now that they hurt ben
injured ben is best ben
ben is a tough dude
whats with all these missed pis
holy shit claypool
fuck is that the same knee he had meniscus surgery on in 2016
sick pump fake by ben
big changes the game
hurt ben best ben
ben going full kobe right now
i see you washington
finally a td
td baby
the most necessary of tds
uhhhhh boswell
wait wtf chris
ben shook that off
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
lets go
not like this boys
if our team could step tf up i wouldnt mind just letting ben rest for the next couple weeks until thanksgiving tbh
fuck did we ever need those points before the half
give that man enough painkillers to kill a horse
great route by washington
fuck why boz
fuck sake bos
if you told me before the game that it would be 136 cowboys at the half my exact response wouldve been makes sense
vintage ben backyard football there hopefully this is just his usual playing up of an injury and he comes back slinging dick after the half
see what happens when stop running every play
did they wake up walking boot ben
he looks like hes hobbling still
you guys remember the raiders game when box missed a couple bad ben was hurt and the xray machine was all fucked up
what the fuck boz
be easy on him folks boswell wanting to fuck off today like everybody else
he probably just needs to take a shit
yeah sure miss the xp why not
who is our backup qb still mason
well this game is going exactly as i expected it
is this gonna be like the 2015 playoff game when big ben comes back to lead one final drive
anyone remember when ben tore the meniscus in that leg and couldnt plantthrow on it thats my worry
well time for bitchner to start calling the kindergarten version of the playbook cuz he cant think rudolph is good enough
this scoreline makes me anxious with my name
this is like the denver game back up comes in and tears it up but we manage to pull it together in the 4th quarter when were about to win half of you motherfuckers are gonna be all man didnt have a doubt
new drinking game take a shot every time romo says outstanding
come on ben we need ya
can we please get a turnover
gotta love those obvious pass interference calls just flying right by all the refs 3 or 4 plays with some very bad pi
why are dupree and bince out there playing coverage when neither of them are any good at it
defense finnally
come back out ben we need you
minkah just go fucking forward man you lost about 15 yards trying to get more yards being fancy
god bless this defense
glad to have the ball back but the steelers d should not be celebrating
right into minkahs arms
wake the fuck up defense you have no more chances offense isnt going to pull its weight
just saying i called the turnover and now mason 1 minute offense
lmao rudolph oh no
wtf was minkah doing on that return he had 6 blockers in front of him
fuuuuccckkkk
fuuuuuuck not only is mason going in but were back to fichtner calling plays
someone go tell ben
mason fucking rudolph
ffs rudolph time
i dont want to see this fuck out here lmao
minkahszn
mason has had his helmet on for 9 weeks waiting for this he hasnt showered he hasnt shaved he hasnt brushed his teeth
fumbled it right to him
where the fuck is dobbs
get ben back out of the locker room
rudolph vindication time
fuck rudolph
masooon timeeee tdd
never forget when that thug garrett tried killing rudolph
great now randys calling plays again
rudolph picking up right where he left off with the 2 ypa
idk if i want boz kicking after that xtra point lol
good tracking by juju
ju ju lets go
wasting as much time for ben to come back in
rudolph more like boodolph this guy fucking blows
see ya next year if its mason for the rest of the season
ive got very little confidence in mason man
just kick it you cant trust mason to both throw deep and get the pass out in under two seconds
bring back jalen samuels check offs
come on boz
earl thomas permanently concussed mason
boswell wtf
damn tbf that was a really long kick
huge little mental mistakes romo
boz u bastard
wtf boz
bos come on man we gonna need you now
boz if u hit this i fucking forgive you
gonna ice our own kicker i see

hell yeah
boziness is good
fuck it lets goooo
ill take it
sometimes its great having my steam 45s behind i see your comments and get the news in advance and then get to watch a pivotal play stress free
wish dobbs was active at least hell make some plays with his legs if ben cant come back
500 iq play there
bosgod thanks for the false start
does ben come back after this
the upvote party today should probably be for the golden leg of the legendary bosgod
boz right now not today old friend
what did mason do through the entire offseason
lord im having heart issues i fucking knew i shouldnt of tried to break in the bud jersey this game
if ben doesnt come back its a wrap
praise be
seeing mondeux fall on his fat fucking belly trying to sack gilbert hurts please take him back to the ps
i thought we picked up dobbs on our roster
ulemieux4u i think i need you to throw out that prayer to the patron saint of second half adjustments again
rudolph is soooo bad

jfc
romo started throwing during halftime and should be warmed up and ready to roll for the second half
so if mason starts second half and gets hurt who takes his spot
adam crowley on snr says ben is expected to be back
really hope he is actually okay and they didnt just shoot his knee full of codine
59 yards holy crap
the man is walking
whos going color for our game is it romo again
im guessing it was just a bone bruise or hyperextension when he first hurt it it didnt look too serious anyways a torn ligament would leave him either on the ground or limping a lot worse than he was either way he looks a lot more comfortable now here we go steelers here we go
til cedric wilsons son is a cowboy
to be fair it took that miracle of a punt return to even get 3 more points
my liver and heart cant take this im a healthy adult and the steelers and big ben are driving me to alcoholism and a heart attack
ok minkah lets do it again
we need a td out do the defense


come on its time for some spillaining
cowboys have been blown out the last three games and here we are
its still weird to me to see other players wearing other greats numbers 92 99 and to a lesser degree 26
halftime the best time for a poop
i fucking love ben the day he retires will be a dark day for pittsburgh they really need to get a qb
thats right minkah
good tackle fitz
please get a stop here
god we make bad teams look like top 3 teams after how many years how has our front office not fixed this
can we stop dropping dupree and watt back in coverage
defense just giving up a long drive so ben has more time to recover
defense is gassed
to all the people that were saying its just the cowboys why are you scared lmao here you go
anyone else worried about chuks as a run blocker he rarely if ever gets any real push on right side of line
we are making the cowboys look so good
imagine getting man handled by fucking dallas smh
so undisciplined
totally playing like the number one team
jesus fucking christ
youd think we were playing against brady
please get a stop we are getting worked by arguably the worst offense in the league
this run defense is elite
if we dont stop 3 and 13 bro
great tackle
3rd and 13 has been automatic in weeks past
okay okay even more rest time for ben and held them lets see this
alright lets tie this shit up
our defense needs to play disciplined
keep ben clean lets get it out quick to our playmakers
can we get the run game going please
yikes who whiffed on that tackle
why is our o so impotent
badly need to not have a short drive
of course we start with three and out
at least berry brought his big boy leg today
aaaaaaand we had a three and out
why did the rams let zuerlein leave was it a money thing
lucky that wasnt picked damn
dallas wants to turn it over defense will adjust
need a sack fumble here
bring in kdot at this point hes a fucking baller and fresh
need a turnover boys minkah it happen
d needs to sack or pick gilbert to bring him back to earth
bro everyone and their mother knew they were gonna run it with pollard there stop the damn run
what the hell are we doing with our linebackers
this is not the same team since we lost bush
damn we still play washington dont we
the tackling is garbage today
are you fucking kidding me
can we fucking tackle
we gon lose
what the fucking tackling
are you serious
we fucking suck
how the fuck did he miss that tackle
whats missing here for the d is it that devin bush isnt playing
this is tough to watch
come force turn over right here
steven nelson burnt toast

doesnt matter if they get no gain a yard or a loss because the very next play the defense falls asleep
lmao right down the field were well well on the way out of this one
anyone else remember when we were 721 and missed the playoffs hopefully doesnt happen this season
zeke rubbed himself down in ky for that
oh for fucks sake
hahahahahahha ok im gonna go watch 90 day fiance
garrett gilbert is joe montana confirmed
getting diced up by an aaf qb
this guy is playing how i imagined mason would be



instead mason plays like mason
why do we always suck at tackling
i wanna get excited for these tackles for a loss but we keep giving up stupid shit like this for big gains

this is frustrating as fuck to watch
we are getting outplayed and out coached
we really miss alualu
were literally just giving them first downs
completion after completion after completion dallas has had all of the time this half but 110
this just proves that the dline cannot have bad games and our coordinators are shit

that was a good play here comes a big play for the cowboys
4th string qb absolutely shredding our defense right now
3rd and long worries me most
mike hilton please come back soon

this game and last week just show how much of an impact alualu has hope hea healthy soon
the defense has made one good play all game this is fucking brutal
now or never here we go baby
we stink
im embarrassed
why am i so excited to hold an aaf player to a fg drive
hey if we could you knowscore a td here and then actually hold on defense that would be great
man i really wanted this team to be the first steelers team to start 80
why is it we are always in this position and come back for the w or our opposition is in our position and almost comes back to beat us but we get a lucky stop idk why but i think we got this one in the bag just steelers being steelers
everyone here predicted this would happen i thought yinz was joking though
i cant believe it either tony
71 against a 26 team

seriously hope i look like an absolute idiot afterwards
if we lose this game they wont let us hear the end of it
just throw to juju every play lol
juju puts his heart in every game

i feel so bad rn
yup here are the steelers i know and learned to put up with it was fun while it lasted
really hope we dont run run pass punt this drive

fuck me we cant have anything good
just when we get something going gotta do something stupid
literally what the fuck
i guess were allergic to extra points
lol shouldve just went for 2
of course we have a td when i go outside to smoke a cigarette i would stay here if it wasnt this cold
fuck the cowbitches
they almost blocked the 59 yarder too lol
this fucking game
its all about momentum and just about every time we think we are gaining we fuck things up again and give momentum back to them feels like we are fighting an uphill battle this game
defense playing styx in their heads rn
lol so will this be the first time we get a 3 and out on the 4th string qb
cant overstate how critical those 2 misses are
some joker on dallas musta yelled andys comin
if i have to think about any bright side to this game everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and were still only down by one score
st sucks today 2 points plus that long kickoff return which costs us even more points pretty bad
saving our first 3 and out for the 4th quarter lets go d
i think our defense got a good rest hope that blocked fg doesnt disrupt our momentum
should that not have been a penalty
embarrassing
oh fuck me running dude
our special teams are special
special teams is a fucking joke
son of a mother fucker
just fucking shoot me
oh fuck off
hard to watch
fuck me
oh boy
bad special teams always haunts teams in the playoffs
fuck this fucking team just boot it out of the end zone for fucks sake
this game is shit
just not their day
pick comming up haden pick 6 now
i turned off the game as a sacrifice to the undefeated gods my my sacrifice not be in vain
two missed extra points means we have to got be looking at some scorigami here
fire danny smith
of all things fucking special teams
and thats how you piss a game away
once romo said the kick was perfect i knew
our special teams has been terrible today
fucking pathetic
what the fuck is this game
wide open cause vince cant cover yet no adjustment
bos if youre going to try to stop somebody dont just sort of wave your arms at him
are yall really about to lose to a backup qbs backup qbs backup
playing like a bunch of chucklefucks
and a wide fucking open receiver to start the drive just in line with what i expected
i havent seen special teams play this bad in years this is ridiculous
fuck this shit
need a turnover
wellllppppp i give up this game was not meant to be
thats the game
fire danny smith into the fucking sun
fire danny smith absolutely inexcusable play by special teams today
fire danny smith straight up fucking clown
good job on giving the team a rest day this week tomlin im glad you prepared them its showing

not trading for a coverage ilb was such a stupid move
i hate zone defense
we shit the bed today we really fucking did
does keith know how to adjust
its those magic white uniforms
wow just slicing through our defense today
damn this make shift oline really dominating our defense
our defense is playing like the 2019 version of our offense god fucking damnit
love it when guys just forget how to tackle
alright we can come back from this lets go defense stay positive
tomlin shows no expression to fire these guys up
i wanted us to lose a game or two so im not upsetbut watching this is just making me lose my vibe man
flag for fucking what
of course theres a flag
great pick but dont bring it out
one score game we cant get an extra point to save our lives today
wooo
minkah making plays
defensewinschampionships

gonna be on the 4 yard line nowrun run run
oh of course theres a penalty why wouldnt there be
ok whatever fuck edmunds we good
it is time to come back my dudes
lets go minkah shouldve stayed down but we needed a big play
feed juju
now make the int count boys
the fact we still have a chance to win shows how bad the cowboys are
have the steelers gotten a sack today
anyone remember that stat by juju 2 97 yard touchdowns
thanks minkah for coming up huge but you should have taken a knee when you had the chance
minkah definitely has a home here in pittsburgh future franchise player
those missed boswell xps really looming right now
jesus come on now do you want to win
really no reason to hype that bama lsu game this year going to be a blow out by bama
theres some breathing room
body slam out of bounds is fine now
bens in his zone
go for the first on 3rd and see what happens i was waiting for a bomb
7 points and take lot of time off the clock please
nice chokeslam oit of bounds there damn called less than that a penalty last week
td on the way
find juju
i was convinced they were gonna get a safety the way this game has been going
kind of interesting how dallas wasnt flagged for a late hit outofbounds there while pittsburgh was last week with lamar in my opinion neither should have been flagged
holy shit dj caught it
these formations come from canada
hobbled ben healthy ben
fichtner ill fucking do it again
conservative but efficient good plays here
is that like 3 or 4 straight throws to the left lol its working
99 yard drive bens idol is elway thats music to his ears
my asshole is so clenched i could cut diamonds with my sphincter
i like this 4 wr set with ben saying fuck it to the run game
that was a forward pass
the monkeys paw curls
fuck me
sure why not

edit ill accept that
refs saving ass
that was a gift
make em pay
i dont understand this obsession with running empty sets and telegraphing the fact that its a pass play every down when were needing a score
of fucking course

edit saved by the flag
the refs finally make a good call
yo i used to like lve what a little fucker
i dont like needing red ball but i wont complain
we gotta get lucky vs a 26 team lmao
claypool does not take shit from anyone
tree needs to bring back weekly videos on this team
i was just lookin at you and you were just looking at me
dont even get why he got hot headed made a solid stand up tackle there
way more fighting going on in this game than i expected i know were technically rivals but our rivalry hasnt really been very relevant in awhile
mcfarland did kinda start that but lve cant be throwing punches there and costing his team
well everything is going our way this drive we gotta score now
beers on him if we win
half this drive is dallas penalties lmao
thats not a punch come on guys this is football
that was fortunate
im cool with the cowboys winning it for us
thank god the cowboys decided to shoot themselves in the foot
mcfarland got his hand in his face only because he was literally humping him dude gets triggered and throws a punch what a cunt
i like romo and i understand his bias but he really has to tone it down a bit lol
they need to do something here went all this way and now theyre struggling
3rd and 8 run time
cmon boz please
that feels like a cleveland coaching decision
not having that pat hurts
pls boz
boswells favorite number is 21


5d chess bitches
does the d have gas left in the tank
show em who you are defense
canaday got beat again is he hurt hes usually solid
those extra points we have to pull through on this
were only down a run or a goal or something
praise be
come on defense get the ball back please
bosgod is infallible and im pretty sure crawford is actually aaron donald in a cowboys jersey
all i ask is that our defense looks like our defense for this one fucking drive abysmal today otherwise
i dont wanna see this special teams unit on the field again kick the ball out
were missing bush in the middle of our defense they are picking on spillane today avery williamson was a big addition
crawford is getting through that middle on the snap every fucking timethank god we got 3pts defense time
guess im blacking out before 8pm tonight
with the way special teams has gone this game im not confident in a field goal for the win
please kick the ball out of the end zone
finally they kick it out
wed have the lead with those two xps ugh
cant make a stop
can they just get one damn stop
of course we dont stop it
id be curious to see a study of which sports fan bases have the worst heart problems pittsburgh has to be up there given our expectations year in and year out

no ones gonna talk about it but lots of credit to the cowboys ol
this has to be the stop now
we cant keep being gashed up the middle
welcome to the game henry
blue wall means push zeke with a big man
he mondid it
good thank christ he overthrew it
give it back to us
lets goooo its fourth downnnn
thank fuck for that overthrow
mondooooooo
gilbert dude finally looked like a cast off reject bum
mondid
he finally did something
good hands ray ray
like what the fuck happened this week
lucky lucky miss cowboys should just go for it chances are in their favor
lets go offense
everyone make sure to call your health insurance provider to let them know to have an ambulance on standby for the inevitable heart attack that is about to ensue
lets fucking go offense protect the ball and move it down
eat up the clock score here and we win
deep breaths everyone we dont need more heart failure
99 needs a black visor
absolutely have to go down the field and waste most if not all of the clock whether a fg or td preferred obviously we cannot leave time on the clock
now go get the td to put us at 25 points and keep the streak alive
can someone explain this to me isnt pushing off lineman to boost yourself over the line illegal like didnt they change that because of troy
come on you bastards score
claypool catch the ball please
catch the ball man
how many drops is this
ben throwing too low atm
i like claypool but dude sometimes just cant catch shit even if it hits his hands
another drop by claypool
ooo hes gotta catch that
fucking claypool man
claypool really looking like a rookie today
ugh were gonna lose because of a missed pat
what a terrible play
claypool has been bad today
we got bailed
i have to believe they are just fishing for pis right
ben got one

he really got one
claypool has to make those catches hes been off tonight
what terrible offensive play calls why the fuck are we going for it all
refs didnt call a pi so they gifted us that thanks
i cant wait till the refs won that game comments
dallas penalties are keeping us from loosing right now
i will take that cheap penalty
make them pay
best part about being a top team is getting the top team calls from the refs thanks nfl
i hate that call but ill take it
the fix is in
ill take it but what a bad 3rd and 10 execution
run it and kill some clock
a win is a win
getting bailed by penaltiess booiss

thats one of the luckiest things ive ever see happen in a game like this
diontae
stay in bounds
diontae you shifty fuck yurrrrr
way to go down instead of risking a fumble
losing to one of the worst teams in the leaguebeating them and having boys fans complain about the refsits a hard decision
stop getting out of bounds fuckers
run the ball
can i get a touchdown amen
well

fuck this game

but its nice to be close to taking the win here
why did you run outta bounds
theory the steelers play down to competition so often because ben plays best under pressure when he feels rushed when he does hes a hof qb when he doesnt feel rushed hes a mediocre qb so weak teams stick with us and sometimes pull it out
td baby
have we just abandoned the run game
x200b

touchdown
claypool in bounds please
lets fucking go baby never count us out
get hurdled you dumb bitch
ok ebron that was sexy
now

the question is


does gilbert have the gusto here
mvp ben
now can the d hold
claypool needs to catch holy shit
ooooooouuuuu
go for 2
i wish we wouldve taken more time off the clock
awesome job scoring but way too much time left
lets go d
ill take it but thats a lot of time left defense please
can we not all out blitz
ebrontosaurus
claypool youre 64 and like 220 how are you getting bullied like that on the goal line bud
defense usually unfucks themselves on these putaway stands


usually
a stop and theyre gone come on
this is looking like that game against the terrible raiders about a decade ago when we let bruce gradkowski drive the field
home run kick this ball out
all signs point to game winning drive by bum fuck gomer pile huh
should have went down instead of scoring please defense pleaseeeee
please dont let zeke run straight up the middle
cmon defense please stop them
lets go defense
come on boys
nelson with a second missed tackle that i noticed
hey google play renegade on 100
our special teams have been playing a little special today
no one expected gilbert
come on watt strip sack
d d d
anyone gonna buy some of this stuff advertised i might buy mcdonalds and thats it
the steelers have given up less than 20 points despite the offense being mediocre for most of the game thats a decent performance
sutton ughhhhhh
im gonna be on blood thinners after this
so close ah
you gotta pick that
alualu must make a huge difference
show me the steel curtain
lets go defense
lets go defense lets go
okay d i promised my first born on the last drive but you can have my second born this time
itsss thirrrdddddd downnnnnn
bobby spills solid in man coverage on a quick receiving tight end in a big moment hell yeah
let go d keep it up
not in the grasp there
just hold them off for 2 more downs and were good maybe
wow im amazed he got that out before going down
alright yall i think its renegade time fire up those speakers
haden saved that play wow didnt expect that pass to go through at all
one more
please sutton
everyone play renegade
haden you animal
not ruled down on the sack oo

how was that not whistled
watt finally gets home and cant finish

well he just finished it there
like 3 holds on steelers there obvs
holy fuck
haden you have been redeemed
omg
omg ty god
yeah boys wooooooooo
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh get fuckkkkeddd
huuuuuge when the game matters
thats our fing defense right there
waiting 58 min to do that
cam heyward stud muffin
sacked his ass ohhhhhhhhh yeah
yessssssss
80 you stupid bitches
that was a filthy bull rush by cam lmao grown man strength
lets goooooooooooooooo
80
thats a pretty late renegade they played there
cam and tj
remember that people whined about this d all game
lets go yall we did it
bend dont break
same time next week guys
major props to garrett felt like we were playing tom brady for some of that game haha
cam fucking heyward
hayward playing in a youth league
what is this madness how dare we show up in the 4th and win it did no one tell them they reversed the script
why does team have to play with my heart
you absolutely love to see it
wheres the dude with the doritos i think you saved this game
lets get a fg to preserve the 25 points streak
heyward is a beast that last sack was amazing
our hearts did not deserve this punishment ill take it though but heads need to roll here there is no reason this should have been as close as it was our offense has some issues it has to sort out but i am confident we can get that sorted before next game lets go baby
game aint even over
i cant believe we pulled this stupid game out of our ass
i accept tj as my daddy
were lucky we have star power one or two players play every week the rest relax if they all would step up wed be unstoppable
what the fuck
just try the fg jesus hell

why not fg
why did they go for it
i miss the days where we couldve picked up short yardage with a strong run game
are they trying to lose
what was the fucking point of signing derek watt
no no no no no please
that needed to be a fg wtf
kick the god damn field goal
why the fuck did we not kick it
we dont deserve this game
wtf
why in the hell do we never qb sneak
why did they do that lol
this has been the worse run blocking game ive seen in years
never go full retard
why didnt we kick
why dont you just take the fucking 3 points sure they can still get 8 but takes the td and the 2 pt conversion this team just trying to kill its fans hearts
why did they not kick a field goal
p u c k e r t i m e ii
questionable if we end up losing this game
fucking idiots watch dallas win now because of that
but i thought we won the game already
come on defense please hold em again
thats a catch i think
field goal
you dont win games with that fucking shit even if we win thats the worst call ive seen in years
lol mike was literally just shaking hands on the sideline like it was over
your st coach not being able to figure out why you cant get a kick up is an indictment on the coacholine and st
the only reason not going for a fg makes sense is because crawford is running through our line like theyre not there otherwise retarded lol
why
this is insane why didnt they kick a field goal and make it impossible for them to win even if they managed to march down the field im so confused
why not a fg theyd need a td 2 woth zero timeouts
okay 3rd born but im running out of future kids guys
steelers should have at least tried to pass for the first down
if they lose because they didnt kick that field goal
lets go defense
tomlin did that to try and stick it to a rival or something like that
im not sure why our run blocking is so bad but its really become a problem
dear god dear god lets gooooo defense
my this is amazing
i dont like this
so why didnt the steelers attempt the fg and instead go for it am i missing something
blatant hold on tj that will never get called
fucking heart attack team
hey i havent watched a lot of football but im confused why steelers were not able to take a knee to run out the clock under 2 minutes can someone please explain to me i have seen teams do this before
i feel sick
we didnt need this late game drama
holy shit headlock on tj is totally allowed
i dont feel comfortable
i cant even sit lol
lots of heart attacks happening
holding
cant help thinking if dak was playing we wouldnt have been close here
were literally just letting them get wide open and letting them catch it
lets go defense
just need a sack
lets go defense
i hate every second of this
exact situation as last week
i cant breathei cant breathe
lets fuckin go
bud was almost there
phew that was too close for comfort
waaaaay to close
put claypool in
thank god
hoooolyyyyy shit that was messy but ill take it
fuck yes thank you god
sphincter relaxing
get the fuck in
fitzpatrick again
never a doubt s
minka was worth 3 1st round picks
i cant take this
aaaaaaaand unclench
your gonna get beatbut you dont want it to be to the cowboys
breathe a sigh of relief
that was a terrible game
80 baby ugly but still great and kings of the nfl record wise not sure if my heart can take 8 more games like this season
holy shit i need a drink or should i say more drinks
history in the makinggggg
two drives in 30

this sub season over we fucking suck gg fire tomlin

yall are children
i get that he used to play for them but could romo make it anymore obvious that hes rooting for the cowboys getting mad annoying
can we complain now i hope so because our team looks like hot dogshit right now and it isnt getting better
stop the count stop the count
3rd and 4 so lets throw a fucking bomb
im prepared for 3 straight losses with this performance
he threw a punch fuckin toss him lol this wasnt a big deal from either guy
2 missed xp are going to cost the game
dumbest thing tomlin has ever done
i dont know if its james connor or the run blocking but our rushing has been anemic lately and it really isnt helping at all
and thus begins a new streak of not getting a touchdown on the opening drive

should of had that mapletron
that just went right through his hands
claypool has to be kicking himself after that drop
this guy be like tom fucking brady out there
what the fuck
trap game time baby
everyone getting panicky either didnt watch last years offense or are likely new fans
playing down to shitty teams

this is the way
i am wholly unconcerned at this point
rsteelers be like tomlin is on the hot seat right now
i can hardly come in these threads anymore with how reactionary everyone is it is so much more stressful games last hours dudes chill out
ok tomlin i see you play conservative right out the gate on a practice squad bold
play to lose classic fucking steelers
difference between us and the chiefs imo
all day ive envisioned admiral akbar screaming its a trap im not being negative were still an amazing team and no one needs to be fired but i really wanted to come in swinging and punch them in the mouth
looks like ben told randy to sit down with his coloring book and took control of the offense
you know how theyve stuffed every single draw weve tried so far lets run more draws
yeah lets go in the gun with our weakest back on 3rd and short
connor is hurt sucks it had to happen to the most durable back in the league
sometimes i just feel bad for our defense offense just trots out there only to do nothing and expects the defense to just bail us out
i live in spain but the s is silent
god our secondary is absolute trash this is absurd to watch
jets fan here does ben not look jujus way at all anymore ive seen like 34 times hes wide open and ben doesnt even seem to looking for him just curious because i think hes still great thanks dudes and fuck the browns
bruh why the fuck is watt covering lamb
fichtner and butler make me want to gouge my fucking eyes out
i hate our coordinators we win in spite of them
im late to the party what the fuck is going on why is tj playing coverage downfield instead of murdering this 3rd string idiot
the steelers and playing like hot garbage on the road against the worst teams name a more iconic duo
i have never been less surprised by a bad start in my life there has never been a more obvious trap game in recent memory
at least theres no heart attack if its a blowout silver linings
this game will hinge on the fact that they didnt get 7 on that drive
thank god he fucked that up because otherwise he would have had the first

what the fuck is going on today
i just love how quickly everyone in here is turning on tomlin yall sound stupid af
15 says next possession plays out as run run pass kick
know whos not surprised jim steelers fans who have read this book before
you give mason or duck a competent oc those two look like qbs last year

arians saved the 2010 season when ben missed those 4 games by letting charlie batch and dennis dixon make plays

todd haley put landry jones in a position to succeed against new england in 2016

i dont think fitchner excels in the essential death sentences those two were given on paper those games
injured ben best ben
please bring out knee brace ben knee brace ben has 10 super bowls
rudolph blows i told you guys he shouldnt be on this team fucking dent brain
if big ben doesnt come back at the half we are donesky
still think dobbs and duck are better than mason
so let me get this straight fichtner has us throw check down passes all game

we have a backup qb whos ass and were at a 54 yard field goal range and we throw no check downs
they had nearly a minute and this is what they got god damn it
said a prayer for boz and it paid off
if ben is hurt we are fucked
were going 97 with rudolph
were 70 and ben finally got his first tweak of the year its over for everyone now limpy ben asshole destroyer
i hate that a majority of our games are heart attack games when they shouldnt be
defense has gotta make a stop and get the ball back to the offense
why was dupree on cooper
activate hurt ben
im oddly at peace 7 hurt his knee hes about to go super saiyan
3 and out good stuff
can we get ben to draw up his own plays again
this offense is a joke today just wow

its either or and we cold today
classic trap game smh
the ravens exposed our run defense
theres that elite rush defense
ok thats enough getting kicked in the teeth wake up fight back
hey lots of time still to play
weak flag there
this is so on brand for the steelers i can always expect the steelers and wvu to disappoint me in games they should easily win
fucking hilarious
why the fuck wouldnt u take the penalty on the try
we look terrible
our defense is absolute flaming dog shit
were losing to a 5th string qb
on the bright side in terms of tiebreakers for playoff seedings its best to lose to an nfc team
stupid energy bringing that out of the end zone
wouldve been nice to kneel it down but whatever i guess
i hope the two extrapoint attempts dont come back to bite us
he really just punched a rookie
that fucker just punched our man throw that bum off the field
this is the year of tipped balls for ben
take a broom and jam it sideways up my fucking ass
imagine if you just tied the game 33 instead of going for a pointless 4th attempt
why does this team gotta pull this shit so much theyve had one blowout and most of the rest have been close the defense also hasnt shown me anything to say theyll be able to stop dallas fucking aye
defense cannot get to this guy have we actually sacked him yet
goddamn zeke is ugly as fuck
thats a fucking bullshit rule but ill take it i guess
its an nfl rule you cant hit the qb in the helmet
they left too much time on the clock though
our defense finally did something
10000000000 coaching fuck up what an atrocity
i swear tomlin is a fucking moron kick the field goal
what a garbage coaching decision 511 on third down and you think thatll work
sometimes you gotta take an l to get knocked off your high horse
tomlin is an idiot why not kick the field goal
okay ive been thinking about this more i actually get not kicking the field goal but since theyre expecting run on 4th and 1 why not try your luck at passing clock stops either way but damn i just feel queasy
again if you were one of those people saying fuck this teamyou know where the door is feel free to close it behind you
got to love watching the steelers cause they make ever game exciting they could be playing again a middle school team and it will be a 1 touchdown game
so we drop this game


takes all the pressure off of being undefeated


continue to win super bowl as scheduled


its called strategery look it up
next week we will lose to the stvincent middle school practice squad
this is turning into a game thats going to come to haunt us come seeding time
lucky im sure well win in the 2nd half but this is pathetic one half a game where we play terrible
too bad our 3rd 4th string qb wasnt that good last year
sorry guys i went to get ice cream and missed the first hour of the game im back now so well get back into it
dude why does tj still jump when a qb tries to throw it fucking hit him
looks like no second half adjustments for our defense
on that gimpy knee when we return
i bet on you guys for the first time ever and this is what happens i think i did this to you
if dak was healthy the cowboys would have already blown this game wide open
we still going to win
ebron makes mistakes at the worst fucking time
of course boswell makes his career long by 6 yards while also going 02 on extra points makes perfect sense
71

would take that at the start of the season though
the steelers offense has been dependent on getting pi calls for huge chunks and making the dbs back off the cowboys have done a great job of either covering cleanly or just not getting called
if you dont like this game you dont like steeler football
bens deep ball is super inaccurate change my mind

holy shit we are a terrible 70 team this is so fucking bad our staff is unable to make any significant changes to our gameplan when we need to fuck this
calling it right now were still gonna win this game and all you fairweather fans can go fuck yourselves
can ravens fans quit bitching about the refs now since they got handed a w by them this week
rivers is honestly so useless
claypool has to get that
can we please pick up a punter in the free agency 34 yards to the 15 hes awful
wow was not expecting that keep
and none of this is even the least bit surprising
why tf does the defense look so confused crazy how we can look so sloppy agaisnt inferior opponents

literally playing like we have the lead with how conservative this is pathetic is a word that comes to mind
yep dont even attempt to get a first down
ok fire fitchner and let ben draw up plays in the dirt
someone should tell the steelers that losing games like this is why they never get the first seed
ben needs to do what he did last game and punt fichtners shitty game plan to the curb and start calling his own shots
when was the last time we had a fat head coach
this team absolutely needs todd haley at the helm
steelers have a history of wearing down teams


people come out psyched to play us


theyll tire out
how predictable was this game lol
hey so i dont actually give a shit if roethlisberger loves being in shotgun on third and a yard he needs to be under center
everyone fuckin relax
steeler nation on suicide watch
trap gaaaaaaame
whenever 99 is in bad things happen
tomlin pull out the backups put in starters and open the playbook we need to put these fuckers down holy shit
wake the fuck up its the 26 cowboys

this team is such a fucking embarrassment
getting out coached by mccarthy right now not a great look
2020 is finally reversing were returning to normalcy again
i think mike tomlin needs to be fired

s
playing down to competition as always
someone wake ben up hes missing the game
we dont play down to our competition
fichtners gone rogue guys hes gonna run em inside until the cowboys quit lmao
yeah were losing
kill me
if we lose to these fucking bums then bitchner needs to be on the hot seat we play phenomenal against good teams but we run non stop which doesnt work against one of the shittiest in the nfl fuck off fitchner
i ask you now can we panic yet
you guys wanna score before the half or nah ben probably
ben is throwing this game so far looks bad
i like how ppl defend randy fat fuck
that one handed nonsense was stupid washington
wheres the guy who said how long till ben fakes an injury
why dont steelers just run shotgun spread and let a ben do this all game
how does boswell miss an extra point indoors
missed pat and ben in the locker room could anything else go wrong before the half
rudolph hasnt missed a step with the 1 yard passes
honestly dont understand why dobbs isnt second string
boswideleft
did we ice our own kicker
fuck you haters
it annoys me that my hulu feed is 3045 aeconds slower than reddit so no drama in this 59 yarder
that was the luckiest shit ever but ill take it
we are fortunate to only be down 4pts if ben wasnt coming back id be seriously worried
captain fat fuck leader among men being tough as nails
can haden defend a pass
things are not ideal at present there are still two quarters
come on td drive here
much respect to big al and all our troops
just get a first down for once holy shit
we fucking suck
tf can we please stop a 3rd and long fuckin trap games
how is this offense murking us in time of possession
why not go for it when they have been stomping all over us ill take it ig
i hate games where we travel west especially if its the damn raiders
yes tony i can believe this is the game were going to lose
ben is ass today
out of bounds should have stopped the clock
i wish brown was still here to complain about not enough targets
juju is still the best receiver on this team and hot take it isnt even close
shoulda gone for 2
boswell 02 on extra points 1 missed field goal

1 60yard field goal

wtf
imo

its obvious this team came in thinking this week was going to be a cake walk from the dropped passed to missed blocks to the passionless defense thus far no one including myself thought this would even be a competition i hate the playing down to teams moniker butdamn if it aint true
worst undefeated team in history
steelers look 07 not 70 my stomach is in knots watching this team right now holy fuck
this front 7 is an embarrassment
defense has been ass since the 2nd half against tennessee
i dont understand why dbs do that just take the touchback you arent ed reed
int is great but you really really gotta go down in the end zone there
i just yelled no pittsburgh at colin come on dude
thats 3 flubs for nantz dude needs to get it together
trailing a 27 team by one score in the 4th and the defense makes a momentumswinging interception on the goal line to give us a chance

if you dont like that then you dont like steelers football
whats gonna be close lol he threw a punch
vander is a bitch
yeah the only reason he isnt getting tossed is because it was open handed
lol our offense is so bad
if only claypool caught that td in the beginning of the game this game would be so different
will the defense be shredded like cheese this drive probably but i have hope
cant even beat the 26 cowboys
their backup oline is outphysicaling our guys
d line has been bad since alula i cant spell his name got hurt
holy shit mongo made a play
come on ben cant let this asshole team beat him a third straight time and likely the last time hell play em
so weve got to find a way to score while draining the clock hire me steelers i have it all figured out
weve gotten bailed out on two shitty calls wow were not normally this lucky
when the refs bail out brady when the refs bail out big ben
claypool is making countless mistakes today
just keep them out of the end zone no chunk plays
ebron is the next heeeeeeath miller
tony romo is deflated
ben is praying im praying were all praying
i have a bad feeling that they go right down our throats
maybe we didnt kick the fg because bosgod has been a bit shakey
we choking hard than that defender choking watt
boswell you stupid bitch
permission to be a steeler fan for the day im trying to hook up with a steelers fan and she is diehard i was given specific instructions not to show up until after the game but she kept messaging me irate messages about the way the game was going so now were watching the game together and discussing damn near every play and why everyone did something
patrick mahomes is going to eat up this buttercream defense in the playoffs

the 70 steelers are going to lose to the 4th string led cowboys absolute laughing stock in rnfl and we deserve it
now these are the steelers i know
seems the consensus is the same anyone want to start a changeorg petition to fire fichtner

were 70 after beating two really good teams in back to back weeks we have a slow start and everyone wants to burn everything down lol you fucks make me sick

yall do realized the bucs barely beat the giants right shit happens its the nfl well be alright well make adjustments and win this game relaaxxxxxxxx
i dont get why people are blaming tomlin bens accuracy has been shit

blame ben
we are so fucked if ben goes down he is the only reason our offense can do anything
damn didnt realize boswells knee was injured too
omg im not even a steelers fans and i hate these refs you aint gotta throw a flag for every play just let them fucking play
to all the rudolph haters please relax yes he looks unpolished but it took 20 minutes to get ben warmed up
lol were down 7 to a 26 team
3rd and 4 better try to bomb it 40 yards
im about to shut this off they fucking suck and if they cant beat the 26 cowboys then they dont deserve the playoffs
our defense sucks again
19 points on this best defense in the nfl fucking pathetic group of players
should have went for 2
yall fucking suck lol cheer up
really vander esch punch him while hes on the ground fuck you
were gonna lose by either 1 or 2

i dont disagree with not kicking it i hate the play call pass it or sneak it
panthers and chiefs is only a two point game
would be a classic trap game but theyre on their 4th fuckin string qb have to think our boys can pull the dub even on the 3rd straight away game
lets do this steelers its going to be a good game for anyone out there looking for a live match stream without need to register check out this link and enjoy d
we go up 4214 in the third ben rests 4th d rests a couple guys oh shit cowboys score 3rd td of the half with 2 mins left get an onsides kick cowboys drive down to 4yrd line tj steps up gets 5th sack of the day steelers win
well this is gonna be spicy
currently my local cbs station is down just my luck
honestly guys i know we are all thinking it might be close but im feeling a 40 pt win
we got romo again nice
x200b

tracy wolfson has wayyyyy too much makeup on
i know everybody is saying this is an easy win but weve seen how these kinds of games have gone as steelers fans lets hope we leave dallas with a win a healthy team
romo is still sucking raven ass from last week
lets go boys
looks like a steeler home crowd
let me guess 3 straight conner runs
sitting down for a very relaxing game im sure
lets gooooo
the lumbering beast
damn it ive been watching at my parents house who have actual cable the last few weeks and now im watching on the cbs app and i forgot its a full minute behind the rest of you jagoffs
lamar who
big ben the mobile quarterback keeps on truckin
ben

hopefully he outrushes elliot
conner should be able to go over 100 yards in this game run or pass pick your poison today
love me some steelers third down conversions
messy
hell of a shot but fucking damn near picked

my heart was not ready for that
picture quality on gamepass is so bad today for sone reason
damn it
pi
thats was a hold but its cool dont call it
i guess the only silver lining is that the claypool drop equals out the cowboys int drop
no need to tackle gilbert he can do that himself
tj with the opposite assignment today
lets go d
hulu tv is such a whopping piece of shit if youre looking for a cable alternative please just pay the extra cash and go with youtubetv
tj watt is gonna kill someone today
tomlin has seen enough
theres nothing else to talk about but gilbert
defense picking up where it left off last week
what happened to pine richland yuppie dinnuci
wtf defense
defense needs to put in more effort this is lazy and they can do better
we are steelering
well then dallas moving the ball with ease early
wow this is gonna be a long night
ok lets hold for a fg and hopefully thats a wake up call
were gonna be fine dallas is having their best drive of the game
this is where teams realize inside the redzone theres not so much space with this d


holding them to a fg
sacked
took long enough
yessirrrrr
bend dont break
bend dont break
rack em up sack em up
ok the defense did their job now its your turn offense
getting stopped by the cowboys d very fascinating
our playcalling is sooooooooooo inconsistent
nice run play what a surprise
run run pass
not a fan of the play calling on that drive at all
love watching this absolutely fucking love it lol
fantastic offense so far boys good thing youre playing the cowgirls
offense looks great against this stellar dallas defense
defense is gonna have to do all the scoring
why am i wasting my time watching this
alright boys let em have it

you can have it
too early to booright
guess we have to wait for the 2nd half to see steelers offense
this offense needs to shape the fuck up this play calling is fucking abysmal
imagine relying on ur defense to beat the cowboys
lets go berry
so time to go nohuddle
were off to a bad start
berry has been eating his wheaties
smells like randy sphincters doing
good punt lets get the ball back
whats up with this play calling let ben cook
rabdy is a fat fucking moron
offense can not afford to start off slow almost every damn game sooner or later its going to bite us in the ass
this medical ad hitting a bit too close to home

literally me anytime the steelers play
lol oh man this fucking team
gilbert is 34 ben is 14
id sneak it i hope they dont though
alright time to score
joe
why is haden catching punts
joe hayden does punts
wait joe haden on punt return
mapletron
i was confused but i guess they left the d on in case the offense ran a play
ben at work
yes claypool
this is good let ben play
now were cooking
mcfarland snatching ankles lol
that is hadens 3rd career punt return 1st ever with us
is conner injured
the best 26 in team history
mcfarland tried to get fancy there
wish he would have kept going instead of cutting back and forth after the first cut he coulda gotten 2 more
what happened to conner
what happened with connor i thought he was healthy
fentanyl fichtner
where is conner
god damnit
didnt get it

are we secretly ass
snell had that one game im over the guy
we are throwing at will lets run it four times in a row
even if connor is hurt why isnt snell in
96 is killing us right now
ughhh why are we running up the gut twice with mcfarland
orakorafor got wrecked
what a stupid play call
yeah take conner off the field on 4th and 1genius
what in the actual fuck am i watching seriously offense
our line is asleep
sneak the damn thing
we make shit so fucking hard its unbelievable imagine if we have someone that follows the kiss formula
no conner lmao
is conner hurt
where is connor
meh worth the risk dont know why our running offense is so ass today though
this offense can suck my fucking asshole
ugh
if youre gonna run the ball on 4th and less than a yard why the hell would you line up in the shotgun
contain lamar but eat shit on gilbert
offensive line is absolutely garbage in run blocking
what the fuck is this playcalling
ben shouldve taken that
holy fuck i had a massive headache before kick off this is frustrating
running up the middle didnt work

randy yeah just do it again anyway
this is depressing lol
fuck mondeux
it was 2nd and 3 right
might actually fall asleep during this weak ass game
classic
out run blocking is fucking embarrassing
gilbert jackson
henry mondeaux
i missed the first quarter is conner hurt why arent they running him on these short yardage situations
i thought mondeaux would have went back to the practice squad
3 runs in a row going nowhere wtf its head scratching honestly
are you fucking kidding me
classic steelers against a dog shit team
thats fucking horrible play design
offensive play calling is awful today
just wow
99 bad
nobody told me we were playing kyler murray
lamar gilbert here
offensive line is ass right now
lol wtf is happening here
gilbert playing like vanilla vick
are you fucking kidding me
out hunting whats the summary so far thought wed be up at this point
i knew wed give up a lot of yards to lamar jackson but were seriously going to give up yards to garrett gilbert
this is so sad
such a fucking hold on watt
watt was damn near tackled
they will have to start accounting for gilbert as a runner
cant run for 1 yard cant make tackles cant contain qb
keith butler is actively trying to take tj out of the game
vince williams man come on
we really need to get a solid hit on gilbert hes playing way too comfortable atm
chiseled adonis called that we would play down to the cowboys its in our blood
lmao cowboys are getting hyped about getting a 1st down
this is embarrassing
is this aaron rodgers
can we get back to blitzing out of man coverage
what the fuck
big groan
well this is fun
wow fucking terrible
of course
absolutely pathetic
lol we didnt even show up today
haha fucking trash team
for fucks sake nobody covering on top
jesus fucking christ
pathetic
they always lose when they travel west
jesus fuck
seriously put tj on lamb smfh
no more zone please
damn against the cowboys
false start wtf
dallas fucking dallas
good lord
how the fuck is this happening
bruh
were going to lose this one of all arent we
why im not surprise
why

embarrassing
should tony romo recuse himself from the game since he played for the cowboys
getting outsmarted so far

we need 7 points this drive right now
lets just get some points on the board 10 is chump change we got this
both randy and keith need fired they hold back both units immensely
when do we get nervous guys when they go down 24
we just look tired man
false start was so bad everybody stopped playing
disappointing but not surprised
put claypool in coverage on d man we might get somewhere
tj against cd genius
can we stop playing down to competition this ish has been going on for to many years
i wanna say im surprised but im really not
we make backup qbs look like tom brady every goddamn time
maybe this damn cowboys td will open their eyes theyre playing like trash today
ah theres the steelers i know and love good to see nothing has changed
feels like the steelers are experimenting why the heck is tj dropping into coverage seems like every time he does a chunk play occurs
i dont want to hear anybody defending either of our coordinators
not surprised hopefully we look better after the half
the entire oline false started and no flag rip
i am embarrassed to be wearing the black and gold after what ive seen so far
conner back with instant impact
time to wake up and put 7 points on the board offense
oline getting bitched right now lol
run run pass excellent
is this our play down game
crazy first string rb runs the ball better than the 3rd string
if we 3 and out here
fire fichtner
oh my god

stop playing the same fucking play
3 and out against dallas
terrible throw ben
this is making me fucking sick
defense needs to make some plays
im sorry dude but diontae will never be a 1 or 2 wr insanely inconsistent
why cant we just sling the dang ball
what the fuck man
the fuckin kinda foofoo fairy fucking toss was that
bad throw
could we stop running it up the fucking middle
ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
please god not a 3 and out
die randy die
im about to turn this shit off and enjoy the outside
lolololololololololololololololo
i cant believe this shit
its happening

its happening
i want to die
fuck me
man this shit is just irritating
this is embarrassing

its probably possible to argue that weve got some of the worst play callers in the league imagine not having randy as oc
lol holy shit that was a good play by the cowboys
fuck that was a great call by the cowboys
of course
we will be fine haha
3 and fucking out sad and pathetic
another 3 and out
another fucking 3 and out who said our defense was better than theirs
hey diddle diddle two plays up the middle

maybe next drive well open it up probably not but we can hope right
stunning and brave performance boys
saved by the flag
that was a great punt return
lmao
dont worry its all part of the plan to give the cowboys false hope
i hope someone says something at half time
no
wow just wow
christ
fucking horse cock
i guess if were going to be exposed its best to not do it against the ravens or titans disgusting anyways

the memes are manifesting into reality
lmao
this is my worst nightmare
time for more alcohol
hahahaha block in the back
even our special teams is being outcoached
i shall be passing away
plenty of time to get our shit straight
ok ok on the bright side that punt was a heater bad coverage tho
they have got too cocky sitting at 70
we caught a break there
great work bince
if that guy doesnt trip the convert 3rd and long
guys im not a steeler fan but i made a huge bet on the steelers to win

should i be worried yet
we need to score here lets see hoping fat randy aint calling plays here or else we go into half 13 down and they get ball second half not looking good
alright jokes over time to get at least a fg and go in with some momentum and shut them out 2nd half
i cannot handle this it hurts
ben has to step the fuck up and we need to keep 30 off the field i dont get why they always put mcfarland in and then abandon him as soon as he has a conneresque run
bens accuracy has been horrible this season how can you expect the defense to be good when theyre on the field 90 of the time
cant keep keep calling run run dump need some better calls
i wonder how much that ad costs purely in network time not production or any of that
any given sunday
we need to play with some fucking urgency now this is now we are in danger of losing this game mode get to work you boys
regardless of what happens the rest of this game this team needs to learn how to not be jekyll and hide between halves of football this team is either dominating or cant fucking beat a jv football team
i feel like we never get juju involved until the 4th quarter
i dont know why guys but im getting an urge to buy a flashlight from amazon
we need a run run pass drive here
dink dunk
backyard football time
i like the momentum were having rn
if we score a td on this drive well win this game
why didnt he just keep going to the sideline
finally a little something happening
side note justin herbert a real one
if we just stop giving james conner the football our offense will put drives together
bens deep ball is shot
fuckfuckfuck
ouch

x200b

ben please be okay
and ben is injured
just tuned in and im shocked how the fuck does this happen
another overthrow how many does he average per game
here comes the fan favorite rudy
sowhy was watt covering cee dee lamb
most of this offensive line needs replacing
holding claypool and leading with the head on a qb
someone needs to be fired offensive line coach fichtner someone
oline didnt show up today against a team that cant stop the run and hasnt got the qb latley
not mason no please god
i blame this injury on all the dumb fucks in here saying ben is trash and should be benched
ben bby maybe rest a series
oh boy
gg boys
we need points here
that looked painful
hurt ben is best ben
johnsons jersey get ripped

and thats not the sort of shot you want big ben taking hopefully just knocked the wind out of him
injections for ben incoming at halftime
hurt ben best ben lets fucking go
sucks to see it but that was incidental not really lawrences fault
activate dobbs i dont think mason is ready after last season
get the walking boot asap
ben limping throws a nice pass thats injured ben for you lol
never question bens toughness he beat the ravens with a crooked nose
anytime ben takes a big hit i get super stoked to know we have maon back there to lead us into oblivion
just tuned in bow bad are we eating shit knew we were gonna have one of these days but didnt expect it v dallas
holy shit mapletron
hurt ben is best ben
ben out there through sheer force of will
shit
get ben some painkillers
pulling a greg jennings against the cowbows
god damn is there a human alive tougher than ben
hopefully a knee brace at halftime helps
at least if ben needs to miss a few games there is time to heal and we can afford a few losses
thank god
helmet to helmet he better be fined over that

ben keeps on doing it td washington
yep ball is gonna be high now that his plant leg is hurt
lets fucking go
best receiving corps in the league right there
wow
lets goooo
there we go
fuck yeah
washington
i love how ebron is so willing to go for the stiff arms and fight defenders for extra yards
there we gooooo
oh come the fuck on make that
offense deciding to show up lets gooooo
way to go boswell
fuck
thats not good
i guess all it took was a slight knee injury
missed pat seriouslycome on
keep passing give ben the ball and this is the result
damn boswell we needed that
hey look we did a thing
par for the fucking course
oh oh
that hopefully just the beginning lets go
when it rains it pours
would be tight if we started out dominating like we totally could be so that ben could just chill in the second half but nooooo also wtf bozchoke
the cowboys qb looks like someone who would play a qb in a lifetime movie but has never thrown a real pass
washington is slick as fuck on double moves especially with bens pump
the outcome of this game wont be decided by the players it will be decided by the courts
tough sob there
where is the advil and tums
were this is the worst possible out come for this game fuck
i think that mightve been a bad hold
ben has one leg
wait did all the fair weather fans stop crying now
well at least boz wont miss for awhile now
did they finally call a holding
i feel like hes gonna come out with a knee brace and deal with it play the rest of the season with the brace and then have surgery after the super bowl
the hell was that romo cbs lmao
yeasss
bens like shit already
ben no pain no gain roethlisberger
fumbled right into his hands
holy shit minkah
attway mikah
lets gooo lets tie this game going into half
lets fucking go
the ball is just attracted to fitzpatricks hands
minkah you beauty
quick someone go get ben
someone go get ben
this year i can die with a backup you really want to play an 8 man box with a threat like claypool deep
uh is ben still in the locker room
fuck wheres ben i dont want mason
kill me
cam sutton
wheres that guy who said fitzpatrick was overrated
rudolph time
maon should not be on the field this year
aww shieett here we goooo
fuck bens in the locker room
mason time
mason rudolph oh no
come on we are down to a 26 team
that was so sick
loooooolllll
oh god mason dont turn the ball over please
geez i thought fitz was gonna run the wrong way for a sec
ball
wow
god i dont want mason in
quackers now
what is this game
he floated that

i swear of he throws a pick 6
so we could have tied this and now we have to try not to turn it over
wait does this mean that rudolph is coming out
oh yea now this is steelers football
fitzpatrick has regressed this year
oh rudolph
mason the goat rudolph will score a td for us
rudolph with your nose so bright give us the fucking dub tonight
rudolph has to watch those floating passes easy to pick off for 6 the other way
show us what you got mason
i like how that never touched the ground cant even complain the catch and no football move lol
minkah

my dude
hello
oh no rudolph
hahahaha fucking mason
hopefully mason has had enough time to pull himself together after the results yesterday
thats exciting just went right into his hands
the battle of the back ups
my my my how the turn tables michael scott
no way rudolph expected to get into the game
what if this is the beginning of the mason rudolph era
ima have to blame the sun for this half
fuck these refs smh
why do people think mason for one drive would be bad hes always good his first few drives lol
so many steeler fans in the stadium they r cheering for that
just run it
mason out there without his chin strap all the way done

these pop balls are gonna fucking make my heart explode today
jujus spidey gloves
where can i bet on josh dobbs losing a wildcard game for us this year just like go down to rivers or what
4 yard pass and time out dont fuck this up
why did dallas spend a to there
replay the down christ
juju channeling his inner franco
lol
also wtf was rudy throwing to holy hell it looked like a dunk attempt
i forgot how bad rudolph was
come on boz
i would attempt a field goal boz can hit 54 yards
no arm
ok that replay of the hit on ben looked bad
he freaking sucks still
lmao
and of course mccarthy still believes in icing the kicker
geez bad football
so fucking early good lord
sigh
fucking sun
holy shit what a leg
boz
holy fuck
wow redemption
boswell youre amazing
yo what the fuck
fuckin right bos
reverse jinx success
he made it wtf
why are you calling a time out
lets go baby
well thats one way to make a record
he did it
boswell that ends well
you beautiful bos
what a fucking legend the wizard of boz
my hopes that this game would be done before my shift starts in two hours are dwindling fast
bosgod is an awesome god
thank you bosgod
that was interesting
boz fucking nailed that one
lol he makes it
god damn bos
love a franchise record
keep rudolph away from boswell dont want him to rub off on him
fuck yeah boz fuck yeah false start
what is this game i just i just cant
were gonna have to come up with some one read quick passes for mason this half
dont think that ben should come back if injured were 70 and its be pretty difficult for us to not make the playoffs need to play the long game here we also need a better backup plan than mason
now that we got some points on the board we better not play like the usual 2nd half steelers
if last week for the steelers is a yardstick its already over for the cowboys
2nd half steelers here we go
so what 4 or 5 field goals in second half from bozgawd
well this game has unfortunately pretty much gone the way i thought it would except for ben getting hurt just had a bad feeling about it too bad i didnt bet that waysigh
defense still looking bad
damn that oline isnt letting tj get through
run from it


dread it


2020 arrives all the same
minkah is magic
man gilbert out here throwing darts
wtf we wouldnt call that play and why it works
is dallas 4th strong qb better than andy dalton i think so
lb on cooper again
lmao dupree on cooper next level matchup
theyre doing whatever they want
jfc
this is so embarrassing omg
theyre still giving them too much space on the ground man
they never call holding for us
how they did both miss
lol whos 73

edit ahhh never mind its carlos davis
we need alualu back
tj bad play
defense looking pedestrian
im so confused with the defense right now such a weird look at times
theyre entire game plan revolve around quick passes to spread out the defense and avoid the huge pressure were getting just gameplan for that guys
the wrs need to start getting massive yac with a gimpy ben
well thats not gonna do it
just end my suffering and beat us already
turnover is gonna get us back
someone please say sike
should be a steelers jersey for williams now
i know he was open i know if ben isnt rushed he probably nhits him but why are we doing risky shit when weve looked like ass
its a td game and second half this year been our thing most of the season we got this
lets make some magic happen defense
pick 6 here would be lovely
what the actual fuck
look at that box count is that a joke

four o lineman and two defenders lined up on them no wonder we cant stop the run
mental check out so far
is it the play call or can they just not stop pollard
what happened to our run defense
cant get a 3rd down stop
is cam getting doubled need a fucking play
did the only prepare for elliot and nothing else
3 lineman and 2 defensive lineman on the 1st down run

bad math again
this is seriously unacceptable
what kind of crap d was that
just like last week large chunk plays on third down difference is the offense was ok last week
if youre gonna just hand them yards may as well just lay down and give them the td and skip the middle man
holy holding batman
pollard looking like prime adrian peterson
this is stupid just stupid
our defense looks weak as shit
random is probably the best ever description i have ever heard for farves qb style
so our run d is pretty bad without tyson it seems
lol nelson
more zone god i hate butler
steve nelson is fucking garbage
the pittsburgh let em break every tackle steelers
i wish any of our backs had the holes these guys are getting
steve nelson scared to tackle zeke lol go for the legs bro
itchin for a int right about now
vince williams dropping back in coverage is my favorite thing
this is just exhausting
yo these games are getting painful we have gotten dominated 2 weeks in a row
everyone who put money on the cowboys looking like absolute genius tonight
cant force a single third and long
fucking coaches and leaders not getting this team ready to play
dude theyre just marching down the field
oh look another lb on a receiver
im in so much pain
damn steelers make me feel like a fool every week
just remember we got 2 more bad teams up next and ones record is extremely deceptive
this guy is really picking us apart
its been all game where linebackers have been on wrs come on guys change something
heartstoppinguuugh
gilbert looks like a hero
we are getting embarrassed
are we doing some avant garde shit with our linebackers like i feel like bud and tj are getting used weirdly today
well this sucks
they should probably start playing man d and get out of the zone
they are wiiiide open everywhere on the field its so easy for them to score on us even for a guy who threw like 6 nfl passes in the last 4 years
lol smh
wtf

no fucking way
this is fucking hilarious
pathetic
push them back for fucks sake why do we let them fall foward
i hate to be pessimistic and theres a lot of game left but we are simply put not playing well what can i say
the tank is almost empty after two tough road games
ive never seen such bad tackling lmao
im used to them giving up 3rd and long to passes

but runs

yikes
might as well just take the defense out on 3rd down
averaging 25 points a game so lets do that now pls
i still have hope
have to get a td on this possession
its not funny tony
99 has to walk home right
can you guys stop with the even we win this its pathetic it isnt a win is a win and keeps our lead in the north not all our wins have been beautiful you take wins how you get em period

jesus fucking christ
welp gg bois
holy shit
how did he get 5 yards out of that it looked like he got lit up 2 yards in
tomlin you fucking asshole
stop letting them run ffs
zeke running through our defense ive seen this before not even gunna get my hopes up
special teams fucking us feels oddly nostalgic
why act like a real team why why

defense and special teams were disgraceful today and no adjustments in sight
what the fuck richard
i get the offense sucking but whats going on with the defense today
as guess the guys needed their clock cleaned today maybe theyll show up ready to play football next week
lets go d lets hold em to 3
im straight up not having a good time
good thing the defense blocked that wouldve been a td he was open lol
it was nice having defense for 7 weeks
worst coordinators in the entire league across the board every side of the ball
defense couldnt stop a peewee team rn
make a fucking stop here please bail out this st unit

fuck
i play renegade and the steelers get a stop
figures there would be a flag
well that was needed
lets gooooooooo
all good after the pick
how bout a 95 yard drive
best thing to happen on that flag tho
nance is glitching today second time he said dallas when he meant pittsburgh
minkah washed lmao
its juju time
lets fucking go
thank you minkah
well that just means we gotta go 99 yards and waste most of the clock doing it lets go
i feel like our qbs are fighting over who can make more dumb throws

i kinda like it
momentum shift lets do this
a stop is a stop this was a very important drive for dallas
tj is the only player ive ever seen kneel in the endzone
shotgun when inside the five
cam made that play
come on diontae you have been jv for 3 games now
man i had high hopes diontae but hes been disappointing me
mccarthy needs dat absolute unit mask
wear them thin
id like to see some running but it wasnt working earlier so i really cant complain
tony romo knows football
need at least a fg
diontae is so good at evading tackles
nantz has been making mistakes all night
that le has been so close to offsides this whole drive
its been one of those games
les go
hahahaha fuck you dallas
based refs i love refball
oh thank fuck lol
jaylon just saved our ass
fuck me sideways with a belt sander jesus christ
well that worked out for the best
phew
phew
conner looks rested
cmon theyre tryna give us this game
thank fucking christ
you chuckleheads in here acting like rudolph can be as good as ben are delusional if you think he could put together a drive like this

only thing he has in common with ben is the ability to fumble
lmao cowboy fans pissed
cowboys imploding
lol the music starting and getting shut off
lol are the cowboys imitating the bungles
the come back kid
ill take that
oh my god enough penalties i want this game over before i have to leave for work

i gotta start getting ready in like 20ish minutes come on
does romo have his contacts on inside out how could he not see the punch
jesus christ this whole dallas team can rot but thanks for the penalties
good to see the cowboys self destruct
we might win today but going 5wide on every single play is not sustainable wtf is up with our running game we need to get it on track pick a guy and stick with him
love it
lve with a punk ass move
got away with another one
got me yelling obscenities at my tv
the fuck they trying to claim holding onto his facemask you cant grab with your forearm and wrist
ticky tack penalty but ill take it
lets go offense
ridiculous
ill take the fg here
cmon bosgod
x200b

mr automatic chris bowswll
boz god
fg it is then
boswell playing so well
ghaut
bro who is this crawford dude sheeesh
atta boz
lets go d
im a novice when it comes to special teams but there has to be a way to account for a guy thats constantly jumping over the los
i want this ball so far out i cant see it
dial it up
has avery williamson been playing today
good fucking knock
renegade
bosgod not even gonna give them a chance to try some bullshit on a return
they say that the team who wins the turnover battle wins the game but boyohboy last two games and 6 takeaways still doesnt leave much breathing room
thank god boswell boot that kick our special teams wouldve blown it
another pd for watt
i know refs have helped a few times this season but i defo feel that usually thats not the case for the steelers so im really not complaining
our d line is literally made of saltines
one 3rd down stop is all i ask for
sure doesnt feel like weve only given up 19
course they get it
holy shit he actually made a play
mondo cool
4 minute fucking drill
bring us home big ben
they man to man and good things happened

waited long enough
that was a mondo tackle
thankfully he didnt set his feet for that throw
cmon defense ill give you my first born or something
only second punt today lmaooo
offense need to step up
time to close this shit out
mondeaux
im scared
mccloud definitely aint scared of getting hit sticked

send him over the middle lol
finally their 4th string qb messed up how is he playing so well when mason is so awful
lets gooooooooooooooooooooooo
if we score we absolutely need to go for 2 we cant do shit for extra points today
lets go 2 minute ben
last second game winning fg time
i dont want this to come down to a fg attempt they e been way too close to blocking every kick
romo with the cave man insult to henry oof
where are they finding all these punters with these foreign names one team has a scottish guy another has an australian guy i think is it because of a soccer thing maybe something to keep in mind when we replace berry
i just wanna say joe is a beast he called that run play out and pointed henry in the right direction
here we go steelers
offense take my energy
were losing and throwing 1 yard passes lmfao
turnstiles up front cmon big guys
claypool man
our o is stacked ben is feeling it lets go
underthrows every pass this game
so many fucking drops man
3 and out is not optimal ben
its going to come down to those missed xp isnt it
and now we got the dropsies
claypool deep td right here cmon
this is a disaster
someone catch the fucking ball please
this game is to close to not be running the ball at all

edit especially only being down 1
somoene catch please gd it
2 drops in a row not ideal
probably on us
we do not need home runs
claypool with the drops
3rd drop by claypool
ref ball thank god
refball refball
jugs machine on monday
lol
how boy that
has claypool pulled one in all day


edit nvm lol
lol ill take it
why are playing flacco ball
our team is playing very disappointing today
good ol refball
we are getting bailed the absolute fucked out with these flags
i wish our offense could play mid to deep routes it would be nice to not have to always nickel and dime
good catch claypool
automatic first down
mapletron being demoted to maplecrief if he doesnt come up with some plays on this drive
walked away to pee before that call so i will be reading the thread in the bathroom for the rest of the game lmk how it goes boys
good shit lets go
lets gooooooo
thats the dumbest rule on the planet jesusss
yesssssss
weak call tbh id be pissed if that went against us
fuck yes
lets go offense
it was a legitimate call so ill take it
lets go diontaaeeeeee
diontae motherfucking johnson
the left side has been vulnerable all game
johnson is such an amazing player
lets fucking go
should have stayed in bounds
clock management mike
dj
dj fuck yes
why does this feel like the super bowl right now what the fuck
all those idiots saying dj is bad after the catch wya
whole bar yelling snap it snapit snapit
lets go offense
johnson fucking saves the day and showing why weve got the most deadly receiving corps in the league
td
drain that clock dont step out claypool use your head dawg

lions fan coming by to say you guys are awesome what a team what an organization

hurdle ebron
gotta use up the clock now
go for 2

makes no difference if we miss it

makes a hell of a difference if we get it
im afraid that theyve scored too early
eeeeeebron
we need the 2
that is a steelers heavy crowd in jerrys house
ok defense your turn again you got this
fuck yes ebron

get 2
this entire game has been way too close for comfort
god i love having a tight end like ebron
holy fuck
go for 2
ebron
got to go for 2
well that went exactly how i thought it would
lets goo but games not over
i hope the d is ready
wooooow
of course we dont get the 2 point conversion

eric ebron
ebron is a fucking beast

god i hope we didnt leave too much time on the clock though
so much time kick the ball out no special teams kick it out
one more time d
shut em down
defense

wins

championships
pick six comin baby
holding my breath
i did not want this to come to defense shit
its all on the d
defense please take my power
we just need the d to come up big like last week
2 missed xp still loom large should be up 8
our defense wont let em score a touchdown
cowboys coach is gonna have a heart attack after that call
you know what this reminds me of 2014 when we took the lead and glennon beat us with a last 30 seconds touchdown please hold them off d
that felt like a dirty drive but that jumping td was awesome
our d got this
make a stand d no recounts
defense fucking prove yourself
alright d time to do stuff
defense gunna have to win it again
d
cb saw that coming the whole way
game gonna come down to missed xps
my chest hurts again
i kind of miss heath miller
how does a mike mccarthy keep his job in february lol
how many timeouts do they have
nooooo
looks like blitzing was the key
damn vince flying at him
bince
edmunds got a break there because he was beat
sackem
gilbert losing it
i thought vince was hampton getting air
when do we play renegade
lets go defense
lets goo fourth down
holy fucking shit
holy shit that was almost a fucking disaster lmao
is in the grasp not a thing any more
haden just saved us so hard

and the election is called

why couldnt the defense play like those 4 plays all game
lets goolo
i still love this defense
and boom goes the dynamite
lets fucking go
defense finally steps up
cam fucking hayward
lets gggooooooo
cam heyward you big beautiful beast
easy never had a doubt we wouldnt win
came up big when we needed it
lets fucking go
i gotta be real this defense is tired game plan this week was to sit back play zone and let the cowboys make mistakes going after a rookie is the way to shake them
80 lets fucking go
big dogs eating
i am iron head
boom
fucking rights
monstrous cam
thats the big play we needed boys
lets fucking

goooooooooooooo
love that big d
dallas hc has no neck bruh
did we win
best start to a steelers season in history 80 mothafuckahhhhhhhsss
holy fucking shit
watt said its time for you to go night night
run three times kick the field goal since we cant seem to make an extra point and yeah this was ugly as fuck
thats funny

heywood set em up and watt finishes him off

80
so many close games our problem seems to be our defense is weak regardless of who the other quarterback is
like last week we played like utter dogshit but still got the dub very enticing for the future
this is the way
can they just please stop playing these kind of games just once i mean are they trying to kill there fan base
not a win yet remember cowboys v falcons
just do a td easiest solution haha
our d showed up
qb sneak
so im going to assume everyone was having a pucker of a time this game
wtf tho just take the 3
well fuck more stress
hmm
isnt crazy how once we started pressuring the qb he started making mistakes
lol running to the outside with conner
wtf was the logic there

banking on another blocked fg
what the fuck are these cunts doing
wtf was that
why not kick a field goal
why is ben scared of qb sneaks
whyyyyyyy
is there any reason we didnt kick the fg there
st has been so lack luster im not mad
wow kick the fucking field goal you idiots
lets go defense
come on defense
im in a nightmare and i cant wake up
omfg
man yall could very easily eat your words
not like this brooooo
decastro looked like a flailing fat boy out there
i dont know if i can physically clench my asshole every weekend boys lets fucking go
if youre that worried about the special teams fire the fucking coach
what da fuck goin on
defense please
there is no fucking way
why
what the fuck was vance doing he walked right past a cowboy and blocked dd
hes out of bounds
just kick the fucking field goal you stupid motherfuckers
lets go defense
such a fucking shit take by romo why the fuck would we do that
dawg
please d please
jesus h christ
dude absolutely fucking disgusting fuck randy
does derek watt not have a role on this god damn team
did we learn nothing from the vikings
im so confused
wtf
omg are we gonna lose this
playing the prevent
lets go defense
this is killing me
i wouldnt have gone for that but i probably wouldve snuck it if i did we havent been able to run all day
someone needs to grill tomlin on why a fg was not attempted he better not give some lame answer like we want our offense to win it there
were gonna lose this
omg omg omg omg come on
this is the way the world ends this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a dumb ass call to not take the 3 points
wouldnt be a steelers game if it didnt end with a heart attack
after i just made a joke shit tf
how many times have we been stopped on 3rd4th and 1 this game kinda sad
how is there not a view of that straight down the line
if we lose because of that
is this game 2019
lets go defense
its thirrddddd downnnnn
deep breaths fellas woosah lol
god terrell i love you your a hokie but do not run full speed like that at a receiver with how theyve called this game
2 more
007


no mista bond i expect you to lose
you know i wouldnt be on the verge of a heart attack week in and week out of tomlin wouldnt make stupid decisions like not going for the field goal
rear naked choke on tj seriously
lmao they gave them a chance unbelievable
fuck it im playing renegade again for the whole remainder of the this drive this is too intense
i think the though process on the fg was to avoid them blocking it for a touchdown return or something still a debatable decision
cmon defense

coming down to last play like last week with our defense on the field
prevent d
alright now it comes down to 1 play
1 more stop
fuck please
you gotta be shitting me right now
ahhh there we go
lets goooooo
whew my heart is still beating so fast
aaaaand thats a wrap
he fucking body slammed watt stupid cowboys
over
ill take it good night
i hated that
jesus man not a pretty win
thank god
lets go
lets go
that was much closer than it needed to be holy shit
lets fucking goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
pack it in boys this one is a win
minkah again
321omg win
i just wanna say for fairness that the hold on tj was flagrant but the refs have given a lot of help this game steelers shouldnt have put themselves in this situation anyway

edit nvm lets go lers fuck the cowboys
holy shit they were playing deep
wow 2 weeks in a row
never in doubt boys
jfc my heart
cant there just be a normal game for once
winsburgh
nearly had a heart attack tho
ben has like a dozen o faces
we find a way
80 baby we did it
never doubted for a second
messy win omfg
damn 80 steelers are fire this season
i can sleep now
the steelering has began
stop fucking crying steelers fans
washington johnson and its not close
favored by 145 losing 130 classic tomlining
to all the annoying fans that are saying fuck thai team you are no longer allowed to root for the steelers if and when we start winning this game and any other game kindly fuck off and root for another team
if we dont put points on the board before halftime this game is over
im going to go grill burgers this isnt worth watching
knew this would happen
im gonna burst a fucking blood vessell
so 70 down 2 scores to 26 fourth string qb dont ever tel me we dont play down to opponents again this is the definition of playing down hell its playing worse
these guys need to just look in the mirror at halftime for 12 minutes just look at the mirror and figure out who the fuck you are because what im seeing on the field today is horrifying
ben shouldve hurt his knee earlier
so were back to boswell hooking shit left again
boswell having a shit game lets see if he can redeem himself with a 60 yarder
if ben is out im turning it off
steelers fo need to be questioned why they didnt bring in a qb
was that a tiny jersey grab yes was it egregious enough to warrant dpi on an overthrow ball absolutely not

furthermore that was not a tackle leading with the helmet on ben anyone who is not an idiot can see that the helmet made contact with him as he was lifting his head up incidental contact

quit whining and start playing
this game is annoying
our line is embarrassing without tyson
come on claypool
second time hes done that team is just dead in the water and not reacting to anything
ugh take the touchback my dude

too much traffic
christ cant even get a fair interception without a damn penalty

nantz you idiot its the steelers with the takeaway

youre insane if you think were driving 98 yards and scoring a td lol
yo what the fuck was that vander esch you dirty fuck
romo is a cowboys apologist man
fucking romo waffling thats a fucking punch
i guess bos doesnt like xtra pts lol
only positive was fitzpatrick everyone else was a negative
lmao when the coaches have more trust in boz hitting a 60 yarder than mason throwing a td
all i can do is just smirk at how shit we are today it is laughably bad
all setup with chinese food dogs and myself are in our jerseys got a really good sativa testing at 245 ground up and a victory preroll on standby for when i get home from work in the morning

lets fucking do this
why we wearing black on top
like we didnt know this bullshit was going to happen
lmao its the first drives for both teams and the steelers rarely have looked good in the beginning of games lets settle down now
optimal steelersing going on right now
whats the point of having a great wr core when you dont use them so tired of how boring we always start out
2 runs and then a dump off pass with 16 yards to go

talk about confidence there
3rd and 15 huh steelering
i so wish there was a hotline we could call so we can voice our opinions to someone inside the steelers organization
hows it feel that our steelers thread looks exactly like the ravens thread earlier have some class
tomlin special shaping up
if your heart is aflutter now how will many of you handle q4 have a beer or two or three as it is often the best antidote
i say punt our offense cant do shit lol
we look like absolute trash
lol ben is already calling the plays randy is so fucking trash
looks like ben has taken over calls
enough mcfarland already we have better rushing options on short yardage
tipical steelers playing down to their competition
cut 99 at halftime please
lmao were fitting outplayed by a fourth string so far 30 yard bomb on drive 1 30 yards running here

meanwhile our offense looks like the browns
tj watt covering lamb
ooof please let ben take shots now
absolutely fuck keith butler
im actually more worried about this game than the ravens game
fichtner calling dumbass plays where we cant convert on 3rd and 1 4th and 1 and butler is having tj cover wide receivers

i dont think our coaches gave a fuck about this game this week
god forbid we let the best pass rusher in the league put pressure on a fucking 4th string qb lol
were getting cooked by a team that lost to washington by 3 scores lol
steelers look exactly like a team playing their 3rd straight road game during the second half
of the season
the only undefeated team in the nfl with an inarguably no 1 defense is losing to a third string qb if we lose this game remember that
what a fucking break that was
steeler football is infuriating sometimes
i fucking hate steelering i dont even know who to blame this whole team is to blame
imagine if we were facing dak it would be 500
we deserve to lose this game imagine being outcoached by one of the worst coaching staff this season
everyone here why is romo sucking the cowboys dick

also steelers
somebody give the sideline a call and give them a heads up we are playing today
ah yes the annual ben shit the bed game against a garbage team
im shocked the spread for this game was 14 points lol this is typical steelers
look i get we played two straight physical road games against tennessee and the ravens but this game is pretty much the football gods balancing that by handing us a w and we refuse to take it
its fine guys now im watching the game i was out and about before but now im watching
its painful watching them wait until theyre behind against a terrible team for them to start clicking on offense
ben cannot throw a deep ball for shit
no deep accuracy dear god
fuck romo man
just tape it up
dobbs should always have a hat because if he isnt better than maon i will print out the pdfs of the gameday programs for the entire 1996 season and eat them with hunts ketchup piled on top of a heap of skyline chili and crabcakes
how is mason rudolph on an nfl roster
50 seconds and 3 plays to get like 5 yards

and they cant do it lol
oh your mother offsets
give me josh dobbs over mason rudolph any day of the week
i am fucking sick
just put dobbs in and throw it in the inzone you have better odds of making it
pittsburgh kickers arent built for kicking that far heinz field is notoriously difficult to kick long field goals at
why the fuck did we not bring in jameis winston
i take it all back boz
i havent checked the rnfl game thread i assume theyre shitting all over us lmao
tj limping god stop doing us like this
our o line sucks this year
really 3 and out
this game is tied if claypool doesnt drop a sure td in the first half yall need to chill

nice of cbs to do an av tribute on a day where hes having an abysmal game
losing in the trenches on both sides of the ball smh
they are going to fucking fg us to death at this rate make a fucking play defense
third string rb 5th string qb
fuck the titans and the nfl for fucking us into an early bye week
the defense looks so inept this has been a current trend this year

wonder what the issue is
remember this is a fourth string qb
can we just play cleveland every week that game was fun
shit defense
we are very fortunate to not be facing cooper rush tonight mike mccarthy is merciful
pathetic
the only reason we are in this game is because of bad play calling by the cowboys
kick the fg you know the steelers wont score
no bye harsh schedule three weeks in a row third week on a road game no injuries pls
60 minutes so how does the military intend to distribute a covid19 vaccine to over 300 million americans

military chemtrails

60 minutes wait what seriously

military absolutely weve been doing this sort of stuff for decades now

60 minutes why are you telling us

military we perfected a memory wipe drug thatll be part of the covid19 vaccine standard stuff be glad you dont remember the summer of super diarrhea

60 minutes
thats another pass right through claypools hands
ju fucking ju
are you fucking serious
another missed pat really been that kind of day man
special teams has killed us today
our special teams is a joke
this really is the tomlin special
only we could shoot ourselves in the foot
the steelers are losing this game because of special teams
worst special teams in the league
most likely underprepared for a much weaker opponent and just not our game today thats all nothing truly to freak out about
i remember in the cowher days he would start every training camp with a day devoted to nothing but special teams seeing the way dallas is winning this game through special teams play i wish more modern coaches would put that kinda emphasis on special teams play
i really believe we are frauds
im not usually one to want to fire coaches but whoever decided to not kick it into the end zone can pack their things and go
the mistakes this team is making right now are just hilarious lol
did anyone think we were actually gonna win today
oh ye of little faith i knew we still had a chance it isnt over yet
minkah is fucking disgusting
why in gods name would you run that out actually a really costly play
why not just fall down in the end zone
this will end with a punt
anyone else think he should have kneeled it
love minkah but i would have loved him to get a touchback
who are the cowboys playing today thought it was the steelers
that shithead threw a punch ejection
vander bitch
what the fuck is his problem
did he throw a fucking punch
vander esch threw a punch

fuck that get that cocksucker out of there he threw a punch
this fucking oline man
lol we really bout to lose because of the missed fg
were playing like we only want a fg which is weird considering weve missed a bunch lol
leaping is illegal
boyfriend walks in this is close huh

me just as i expected

another game where were up by a few scores and breeze to a win would be fun instead of raising my anxiety week in and out huh
this is bullshit nfc east is a power house this year
stinky poopoo
risky not calling fair catch
i have a feeling boswell gonna have to come in clutch here hope im wrong
we got a bs call


ill take it
lets goooo respect bens space
we really celebrating the refs helping us against a 26 team
a gift a fucking gift
thats the first one for ben in 5 years i think lol
weak but legitimate call
tbf the calls have been reasonable in some cases they just feel like dog shit bc weve played so bad and everyone hates the undefeated team i dont agree w all the calls but overall refs just suck in general so
omg theyre only going to win this game bc they have more points at the end
claypool dude
that was a weird conversion attempt it was obvious that he was throwing to claypool come on ben youre better than that
claypool isnt playing bad but he hasnt made any plays on some catchable balls
holy fuck defense
are the cowboy wrs covered in grease
my apple watch just told me to take a minute to breathe haha
this one is for all the infants in the game thread
a father teaching his son a lesson
80 boys
eat it dallas
classic cocky steelers come on man
i dont hate going for it but why run the ball outside
stop the count now
we did not deserve to win
incoming pick 6 from ben
that was some cute playcalling exactly the kind of thing thats caused us to steeler games against scrub teams
oh man elliot is already averaging 2 ypc we lost game over lets just forfeit now

s

these game threads are pathetic
i fucking hate rudolph so much
so now the steelers finally showed up to play the game right after i pitched a bitch on this thread like 10 minutes ago roughly i have been mostly a lurker on reddit for over 3 years i have only posted less than 50 times total ever hell maybe less than 30

i dont count or even pay attention to updownvotes karma etcetera i couldnt give a fuck less i wont even engage in an argument on here i dont have the time or headspace

but believing in superstition maybe i should post on the steelers game day thread more often hmm
how bad is it that im ready to turn on this team they deserve to be scrutinized this is dogshit from them
fuck the cowboys and fuck all you fake steelers fans who give up on the team before the games over every week
these announcers are annoying af
no lie the yall are overeacting people are as annoying as overrators lol
if ben is hurt we can pack it in for the year i want no more of the mason rudolph experience he tried his best to shit away that possession
its happening
i hate it here lol
our defense is going to give up a td this drive lol
sure do love the 12 wasted timeouts per game we always have
were losing to dallas guys seasons over
best case scenario we win by a field goal
worst case scenario we lose a trap game and get the undefeated monkey off our back while also continuing to be the underdog in all games moving forward
bench snell already hes not a power back he was a fluke back hes 3rd string now
this might be the single most pathetic performance ive ever seen in my life it is inexcusable for a socalled elite defense to get worked by a team that hasnt even scored a touchdown since october and the playcalling on offense wouldnt even be innovative in 1945 absolutely abysmal and everyone associated with the team should be ashamed cant believe i wasted an hour watching this crap off to do something more important like slam my fingers in a door
im not saying just tomlin but coaching is a problem
like derek watt was the biggest waste of cash imagineable dude hasnt played more than 1 game i think
my bad everyone i took the steelers in my survivor pool
and their defender leading with his head for the extra shot on ben just awesome
all we needed was ben to break his knee and we are all good
ah 2018 boz is back
shew i gotta admit it cowboys fans are entitled to their anger right now thats a shitty way for a half to end
idk what everyone is talking about this dallas d is as good as ours
1 sack im insanely fucking disappointed man
if we dont have the easiest schedule in the league were 43
giving up a 9 yard run thats fucking pathetic
watch for a fake dallas has nothing to lose
claypool with another drop
ab in tampa bay seething rn looking at juju
did we figure out how to keep juju with the cap as it is or nah
we always rally in the end baby
missed 2 extra points but made a 59 yard field goal lol

is it too early to panic now am i overreacting
reminder dallas has only punted once all game

this defense is only elite when they earn or luck into a couple of turnovers
its like every good play is met by a bonehead play i love minkahs aggressiveness but the play there is to get the fuck down and get the touchback
johnson tries to do too much after the catch and ends up doing too little
i really hope boswell doesnt lose us the game in the same game he made a franchise record
this game feels so gross
you have been awful today defense it wont matter if yall make a stop right here
headline tomorrow pittsburgh has until 5 pm est to clear 125m in cap room after signing zebras

suck a dick jim nantz
im surprised that people are surprised that wed play down to one of the worst teams in the league it always happens lol

why i was so confused about media members calling this a blowout coming in that never happens
afc championship game chiefs 100 steelers 0
lets win this for biden and harris
im down to fire fichtner win or lose after this game

if you think about it if we dont score this first half including the first half last week thatll be an entire game that fichtner calls the plays and the team has scored 0 points all the points last week came in the second half when ben started calling plays

seriouslyfucking fire fichtner
lol coaches didnt prepare us on all three phases
this thread is worse than the game somehow lol
so fucking done steelers look like the 26 team here so fucking done

whole team is fucking lazy and tomlin is literally just standing there doing nothing i havent seen him speak a single word all game meanwhile mccarthy is over there actually coaching
that was openhanded dudes

i hate the cowboys too but that was clearly openhanded
id say stop the count but im pretty sure very team has made that joke at least 40 times
lets play down to the cowboys woo
im so worried that this is a trap game for us smh
waaaaahhhh waaaaahhhh my favorite football team isnt doing everything perfectly theyll never win another game again
calm down its the second quarter you guys act like our season is over like fucking chill
tomlin doing it again overlooking opponents and not planning enough for the one were playing
nothing has changed kaepernick
guess roughing the passer penalties arent a thing anymore
and now you people see why tomlin was under scrutiny in years past stupid decisions like that keep him from being a mastermind of a coach what a stupid ass decision to let them back in the game by not trying an easy field goal
bidens america made bens knee weak
romo is such a little bitch its insane
play down to your opponent the mike tomlin way
oh and thanks to the yinzers who voted cheeto man out in pa
wow dropsies
another deep sideline incompletioncan we cut that shit out maybe some rub routes or something
im worried
seems about right
the renaissance of garrett gilbert
just watch this 4th stringer pass all over us because our defense doesnt know their coverage assignments or zeke mad dogging us
defense is garbage since the 2nd half against tennessee
its only one play
holding on vince williams
beginning to smell a lot like trap game
what is this horrible play calling people told me its time to forgive fichtner
what the fuck are these play calls is fichtner and the team trying to lose what the fuck
i love it run run pass punt everytime until we get an almost unrecoverable deficit
fire fichtner now kill him vote him off do whatever but fucking christ just get someone who doesnt run on 2nd and long
romo is salivating right now
this is vintage perfectly aged delicious rare exquisite steelering
why do we always play down to our competition why
maybe stop running it so much
any one else feel like we are watching a dallas commentary on cbs fing romo
holy crap phones are so expensive i thought the flip phone looked cool but its like 1200thats almost as much as i paid for my first car lol
i swear to god randy fichtner gotta fucking go
i would have personally did an end around with claypool on that one or at least put him in motion to unstack the box in the middle
kick the fucking fg
we are being outplayed on both sides of the ball
okay now im getting mad
the standard is the standard
i know theres been posts disproving the steelers lose to bad teams thing but like
just tuned in and wanna ask
what the hell is going on with this team
i am going to go throw up
stop the count
this team is a fucking embarrassment to watch
we are getting blown the fuck up by the cowboys right now
worst secondary in the nfl still proving it
welp seasons over s
its the second quarter i swear to fuckin jesus if i hear someone try to cal for tomlins head imma lose my shit
leave it to us to be embarrassed by a fucking 26 team what a fucking poor effort by this team so far fuck our offense
ive been saying all week to myself that this is the trap game well here we are
if we are going to loose then let them hang 60 on us
this must be our bye week
i was having a great day until now fuck off
why do we lose to lower teams
the whole lol everyone need to relax haha right fire tomlin s is so old as this point getting upset about predicable collapses against horrible teams is not an overreaction its completely legitimate
im embarrassed by this steelers performance right now
this shit is a joke lmao
so is it gonna be 170 at halftime or is our defense gonna man up and only give up 3 to this elite garrett gilbert led offense
lmfaooooo
lmaoooooooooo
ben is playing like hot trash right now right after i said this last week he threw a td against baltimore so bare with me
i wish i at least lived in pittsburgh but no i live in texas and im going to get shit on tomorrow classic man
im gone me when we wake the fuck up
hay subreddit en espaol porque decir fuck y no vayansle a la verga no se siente igual
its allll goood chill people our d will pull it together and save us
literally dont let fichtner call another fucking play this game we were favored by double digits and now were down by double digits as bad as the defense has been theyve held them to 2 field goals when they couldve had more this shit is on fichtner and his patented 3 and outs

trap game anyone fuck we need to right this ship before halftime their guts are wide open
it as if we thought this game was a win before it was played our steelers have not shown up yet
stop the steal
this is on tomlin
based on this threads supporters we should just go ahead and put duck in there and see what happens
anyone that says we dont play down to competion is wrong im still confident well win but this is not the first time this shit has happend
the real steelers are waking up baby
grabbed his jersey and arm no call dirty hit on ben classy dallas
well this games done if ben is dead
if we put in fucking mason rudolph i swear to fucking god
now that ben is hurt we will be better this is the way
astros cheated
fuck
that throw was reassuring lol
and just like that its 7 points screw you dumbfucks calling the game in the 2nd q
of course boswell misses
ben looks like hes hurting but eh i guess its not effecting him too much

rudolph redemption arc
minkah where tf were you running
so ben has been saying that dobbs has been helping him see things on the field yet hes inactive and we are stuck with fucking mason
td to juju please
probably a hold and they are out of fg range
damn rudolph just looks lost out there
sorry guys ben went to the bathroom so im in gameplan is not letting anyone got me with my helmet rudolph probably

reset the clock
why the fuck dont we make dobbs the two he was always better than mason
maybe we shouldve invested in a fucking backup qb
i think we need duck part 2
is there anyone in free agency we can sign to play qb can we trade for fitzpatrick
boswell gonna be good from 63 yards
this team is playing jet ball what the fuck in a taint lickinnbasket is this
this is pathetic
just end the fucking half jesus
can someone fill me in im not watching is ben out
if ben is hurt that is just compounding what has already been the worst day of my life so far
it would be nice if he was actually consistent
what are we thinking that injury was mcl sprain
perhaps the worst half of the season injury notwithstanding run defense still suspect butler too ignorant to understand that pressure needs to come up the middle when everything is a quick pass giving snell and mcfarland burn instead of conner too many ridiculous decisions by this staff
face the reality that at some point this year we will have to rest ben a game even if he finishes today
we are not that good lol
butler is handicapping watt jesus christ get rid of him
lol i hate it here
jesus this is painful
can we just run slants and rub routes and curls and things why is there no intermediate passing
classic trap game
this is honestly embarrassing for our defense
we cant stop the run we cant tackle no wonder we are losing this game
yeah this is a loss
its almost the 4th
we cant stop the run of course you go for it
these guys looked gassed man
we have them right where we want them
time to fucking score
are we suck
its hurry up offense the rest of the game

need 7 a stop and 7 and its over they can do it will they
boo boo smith schuster callgod
backyard football time
well being undefeated was cool
wow he just missed
mapletron get some syrup on those gloves
lord why yall blaming chase for that second drop ben threw it a mile behind
1st and 15

they better not run it here
somehow we are still the live betting favorite
why is cam on the field
quit selling cereal and make touchdown
oh fuck a flag
this is just fucking comical at this point with the kicking team
i never got over my extra point anxiety from bos bad season and its through the roof tonight
special teams are special ed today
if you think about it we could be 16 with how some of our wins went lol
ah here comes the special teams regression weve been waiting for
02 on extra points with a 59 yard field goal surely this is the first time that has ever happened in history right
steelers are 05 vs these refs in the last 5 games
all 3 of our coordinators are having a shitty game ficthner has the offense looking like a dead corpse butler has the defense playing the worse matchups ever and danny smith got the special teams shitting the bed so hard its the biggest reason were losing right now

but somehow were still in it and will win this shit
special teams really trying to lose this game
for all the whining about randy were gonna lose this game on special teams lmao
we are frauds
the secondary is badim tired of people thinking its not
like i said this team fucking sucks cant even beat the cowboys
every time this team takes a step forward we take three back
fucking fire the special teams coach
its over
edmunds making dumb fucking plays nothing new

jim nantz doing his best lou holtz impression right now
eject him
are you fucking kidding me vander esch
he just threw a punch clear as day romo
man id be wasted if i took a shot everytime the steelers got a bailout call
throw his ass out that was a punch
fuck you vander bitch
wtf he punched him lol
vander esch playing dirty as fuck
dirty as fuck right there
lots of deliberation considering he just hit the guy in the face
used to like that kid fuck him
i swear its hard just to catch a break
renegade time yall
i am smelling a spilane stopturnover
have the steelers run the ball once this half
smells like a trap game
only good play he has today mondo still trash
lol yall ready
relax
guys i dont give up hope easily but i am scared that were gonna make a critical mistake
please dont let this come down to boz i like him but he has been shaky today
we are so garbage lmfao
lmao 3 and out
obvious call

hands to the face of the qb
ben got an rtp call its a miracle
gonna buy a ref jersey after this game
the fact we need the refs to hand us the win against the cowboys is pitiful
cool lets play baby shit soft zone thatll get it done
lol we have been unbelievably lucky and still barely winning they are on some shit ass qb and our defense suddenly sucks dick we look like the jets
all they needed to do was run run run and kick a fg make this gg dude drive down yjr field with no timeouts
great teams find a way to fucking win
breeze of a game never in doubt
dont try a fucking field goal
if they lose im done with this team that is absolutely ridiculous
tomlin is an idiot for not kicking that
at first i didnt think it was a catch until tomlin threw the challenge and now im thinking it definitely was
refs giving dallas a free timeout to rest and make a play with that review
yall up in here acting like that fg was a gimme
thank god but seriously fuck you tomlin
thank fucking god dude jesus christ we in no way deserved that shit
fuck my ass with a rake we did not deserve that but holy fuck my voice box is ruined
no trap no trap no trap no trap
panick


for real chill the fuck out its not even an important game if we do lose
so should i start playing renegade now or
30 its over going to watch a movie or something
is it just me or did that little skirmish this week between fichtner and ben result in ben having less control over play calling ben looks uninterested and like he isnt trying today because these arent his plays probably isnt true but i just feel like ben is petty like that
we stand zero chance against kc
it is so obvious when ben is calling the offense
seconds from turning off this is embarrassing
herr derr stop being negative this early herr derr its only been amount of series herr derr
im not sure what hurts more that its happening or that we fucking knew it would happen
were losing to that fat fuck mccarthy
if we lose im protesting
im gonna unfollow juju if we lose
that lazy snap missing a play before 2 mins encapsulates everything weve witnessed thus far
im so tired of watching us air the ball out lmfao bens deep ball is the worst in the league
take him out of the fucking game this game is not worth ben getting injures
there is the capn fat fuck pump fake and wtf boswell
were so fucked
get outta town boswell
thank you dallas for taking the penalty
on behalf of all of us we would like to sincerely apologize to chris for any remarks made about the missed extra point

we cant stretch the field and i think defenses are starting to catch on to it big bens deep ball lacks accuracy and power fuck it sucks so much to see age and injury bring one of his best attributes down like this
2 games we cant stop the rush our defense is being exposed
our defense sucks
you guys still think were a sb team
christ even when they start moving they just fuck it up come on already
this game needs to be a wake up call for tomlin regarding our offensive play calling this shit can not slide if you wanna make a deep playoff run
im actually happy we might lose this game lol maybe itll make people stop acting like were the best team in the league
right i mean ben is better then our second and third string but imagine if we had a lawrence taylor we would dominate for the nest five years only challenged by the cheifs in our division
we gonna lose arent we
not sure if anyone is a penguins fan here but this is kind of like when the pens play a no name goalie on a bad team they just get outplayed
selfish not taking the knee
romo is such a homer piece of shit today
we should be down 10 instead of 1 so this is as good as we could ask for with how this fire of a game has gone just need two more stops and one more score lets get it
mondeauxxx is so bad
lets run it 3 plays in a row theyre used to passing at this point
fuck everyone that says we scored too quick i have faith in our d god help me
are you fuckers gonna let them back in the game like really

note this is only as accurate as nflcom when the bot triggers
this game as all the makings of a classic tomlin choke job lets hope it doesnt happen
yall were real cocky this week i said this would be closer than predicted
damn man i really thought we wouldnt do any steelering this game i guess im the fool
this is why mike tomlin deserves criticism he has consistently lost to the worst teams in the league
i expect apologies from everyone that told me i was overreacting
was wondering when the real steelers would turn up
yeah we are losing this game might as well take a nap
serious question what qb are available around the league or trade options
too late to trade for fitz lol please be ok ben
and this defense wanted to be considered one of the best of all time
get sutton off the field that was an embarrassing effort on the tackle
if it isnt over 50 yards dont let boswell kick today lol
the commentators never cease to amaze me with this justification for bullshit behavior every week they just try to justify these obvious personal fouls hope the steelers score a td on this drive to stick it to them
defense is not 1
one of the worst 80 teams in nfl history

5th string qb if we lose we are pathetic
an aaf qb is shredding us
told myself i was gonna play through and beat super mario 64 sunshine and galaxy before playing through super mario odyssey finally had it in my backlog forever and every time i would get into it something else would come along that would distract me by the time i returned to it i forgot what i was doing moon locations moves get rusty and i just die a whole bunch losing all my coins

just restarted odyssey again and realized age of calamity drops in less than two weeks

hopefully i can finish odyssey in two weeks lol

hey romo if you would shut the fuck up that would be real great k thanks
the only positive in this game is that now i dont have to worry about winning a sb now i know were not making it
this defense is absolutely fucking pathetic from top to bottom the biggest steaming pile of dogshit cant stop anything
connor is so fucking trash and we keep trusting him to do 4th downs
i dont care that we won the decision not to kick that field goal will forever be a stain on tomlins career what a total shit show barely beat the 26 cowboys
concerned about our depth on d line and playing down to competition but trying to stay positiveshades of mike glennon are dancing in my head
damn buffalo ravens tennesse and kc will all most likely win today gahhhh would have loved to build a bigger afc lead
i thought this would be the first game i wouldnt be nervous i was wrong
anyone streaming it
crackstreams isnt working right now
damn that was a ballsy kick would have been dope as hell if he made it
x200b

tony romo is calling this game

x200b

hmmm
cowboys deferred we get the ball first
here we go
gilbert alright coach any advice before we get this thing started

mccarthy greet death like an old friend

gilbert
so weird to be in black
finally
seeing a toooooon of towels in the stands i love it
lot of us dallas steeler fans in the stadium today
party time boys
mcloud so shifty
why are we wearing home jerseys
my opponent in fantasy has johnson juju ebron and the steelers defense im conflicted to say the least
look at ben run
lmao ben good job
my man got wheels
i could listen to romo all day

wheels
lol with our luck we are going to be the only team that doesnt rush well against them
ben with the pace
bens arm is definitely stronger lol
s p e e d d e m o n
chase gotta catch that but the o line is getting a good push so im encouraged

at work right now if we score tell me plz
as long as they consistently dont call pi it actually helps us

less flags means less opportunities for them to get bailed out
just tuning in what happened on our first offensive drive
fucking hell come on guys
anyone have a radio link
williams wasnt held
hahahaha they are marching down the field fuck this
itsatrapgif
anyone got a link to a good stream
not the best start here
i wish they wouldve just started ben dinnuci
alualu was literally our key to stopping the run without him we get shat on
why fucking why
oof
leaaaague leeeead
blitzburgh
lets go ben
rudy rudy
damn that ben stat is mad
something tells me we didnt take this game seriously during practice this week
ill be damned
their defense is playing better than ours their offense is playing better than ours

this is bad
wtf is that drive
we are punting better every cloud
sigh
love me some steeler football lol
im kinda worried a 57 yd punt means we are going to get a 30ydr at some point this game lol
berry fuckin upgrades boys
awesome run blocking so far
no huddle please
michael jordan who who
wonderful play calling
um what the fuck
we are just feeling them out offense and defense will make adjustments its always this way in the beginning of the game remember its not how you start but how you finish
lets go defense
too soon to call the trajectory of this game steelers have been a second half team all season but dallas is getting the start dallas needs to keep this competitive
steelers been pretty good on 4th down this year
excellent d
lol cowards
wheres ray ray
got a stop thats all that matters
why is haden taking the punt
at least the defense is showing up now offense needs to get in the game
romo talkin trash
is that like when chad johnson wanted to kick a field goal
mcfarlandd himself there
there we go much better
here we go
can we get some points this drive
there we go
claypool wanted a whole lot more than just 14 yards
lve almost fell there lol
dont let those knees be exposed boys nfl might fine ya
mcfarland is looking good
here we go
theres there short passes i wanted
gotta go for it
not even close
fucking fantastic
when tony mcfarland runs it reminds me of happy feet when the little penguin dances funny
take the points
its different
go for it
go for it
why mcfarland
really


run up the middle



are you fucking kidding me
thats my team
what the fuck is this play calling three times the same play
yikes
ol playing weak as shit
what a play call
fucking weak
god dammit
pathetic from the offense
they know you are doing that so why tf do that
line up in the i and run it down their throat
just have ben sneak it next time
offensive line needs to get its shit together theyre 30th in pass block win rate and 19th in rush block win rate so far this year and as teams start squatting on the short stuff thats going to really hamper the offense
nice job ficht
youre blowing it
mother fucker
not surprise
hindsight is 2020 but we should have taken the points
also you should tie the game there
fuck
three fucking runs up the middle in a row of course
is someone on our coaching staff paid per shotgun snap
braindead saw that coming a mile off
lmaooooooo
wow
well hopefully that makes us abandon the inside run
damn it
yeah lets just run the same play we ran that didnt work at all sounds like a good plan
oh my fuck
wtf is going on this is embarrassing
those yards are about desire
facemask
my coworkers asked me why i was worried about this game all week if only they knew
is it the second half yet so our offense can show up
this is very embarazzing
lamar is that you
steve young
lets get a turnover
do we not know what a fucking spy is
so have people worked out we cannot deal with a running qb
i guess cowbays are allowed holding
why is mondeaux playing
i cant fucking stand mondeaux
cowboys got a good game plan
can we stop running the ball its clearly not working
yeah just let him run to the end zone if you want
honestly rooting for gilbert at this point its ridiculous
the big problem is the o line is getting blown up every play
tj watt
i should have known as a longhorn fani should have known always be a weary of a longhorn playing in texas
blah blah blah
fuck keith butler
wiiiiiiiiide open
wide open again how
no false start
lol fuck this team
why was watt covering lamb
wake up time
how is he that open
false start
what the hell is going on
okay offence can we get going now instead of the latter half of the 3rd quarter
heyward is conner williams father dragged him along for the qb pressure
lmfaooooo
jesus christ
yikes
watt covering lamb thats an interesting defensive scheme
nightmare start
like im not even mad i knew we were gonna get trap gamed
still not worried but butler is a fucking dumbass
this team better get it together with all the shit they were talking all week
alright this is how were doing it today sweet
so we use our smallest back on 4th and 1 and use our best pass rusher in coverage on third down am i missing something here
did the staff member with covid have the entire game plan with him in quarantine
was starting to think theyd do a browns and keep trying what doesnt work
both sides playing bad what the fuck is happening
this shit is not surprising at all unfortunately
run run

pass

seriously
not surprising but also calm tf down lol whole game left
its like were in a whole new playbook
hopefully we start taking this team seriously and play like its all in the line theres still time lets goooo
run incompletion draw punt
stat line is crazy rothlisberger 69 4 yd avg gilbert 69 94 yd avg

i think weve ran like 20 jet sweep plays over the last 3 weeks and only handed it off like maybe once or twice
have ben make the play calls fitchner is clueless
lmao
amazing
that was a good play by them
fucking trap game
oh my fucking word
yeah not a good throw thats on ben
this is a fucking embarrassment
jfc
why are we running so much its not working
fucking bullshit man
i seriously wanna cry
unfuckingbelievable
what the fuck

yeah tomlin special even if they pull it out
bro how
so flat to start this game bout to get reamed out by tomlin at halftime
of fucking course
what the hell just happened
we were getting wooped by the the cowboys
yikes
dive dive drag is every drive
if we give up a touchdown here im gonna cry
why are we like this
lets go d turnover time
this is hard to watch
vince is a beast
what in the world
i love tomlin most weeks but im so tired of this shit happening it cannot be overstated how predictable this happening is the steelers are known for doing this shit and it costs us big every single year we didnt make the playoffs last year losing to the jets we didnt make the playoffs the year before losing to the abysmal raiders and lost the one seed year the before that losing to an abysmal bears team if we lose today i guarantee it will have a huge effect on playoff seeding
ok now will the real steelers please stand up
awful hopefully 2h is a diff story
sigh i have the steelers in my survivor pool this week need a comeback come on boys lets rally
good thing nfl games are forever long ways to go in this one but no points here and im gonna need a fireball

no reason to play conservative anymore
good start to the drive need to score here
dj so slippery
not a big fan of todays game
oh fuck ben
oh no ben got hit hard
nooooooo
shit motherflinker
f you see kay
fucking hell
offensive line needs to get their heads out of their asses
when i was in iraq they had bad company come out to see us

thing was bad company was touring in europe at the time

the guys coming out to see us were people who had randomly played with bad company for various things over the years one of them was the same age as me

i still think about that
fanfuckingtastic
such is life in the national football league
holy shit ben come on
no no no no
head hit

rudolph time baby
mason rudolph is in guys
oh dear god its mason rudolph
oh gawd
great d but ben is in the locker room
2019 part duex
ben
is this a nightmare
turnover
mason time bitches
hello mason
can do without the team photo op when theyre playing like this
if cowboys punt its rudolph time boys
dont kill us mason
come back ben pls
he has zero zip on his passes
sutton on some g shit that was so sick
you haters need to calm down a little
i put up my tree already rudolph take my energy
they probably didnt expect to get the ball back this quickly
field goal is fine herejust dont fuck it up rudolph
lmao how lucky can you be
rudolph will be 15 improved this year
hey this mason guy is pretty good s

lets pull santas sleigh
wtf
incase everyone was wondering rudolph is still a checkdown machine
ben is out thentime to switch to booze
coming back on a hold
fuckkkkk
wish we had jaboo
did he even warm up
i think i would prefer duck as the back up
yup rudolph still sucks
rudolph is a bitch
could we be any more obvious that we were going with a screen on that
of course mason wants to be a hero

run the ball
bos pls be god
wow
lol boswell
what the fuck bos
throw a hail mary
what happened to ben
im just happy we stopped the points dallas could a potentially had
in bos i trust
great kick
lmaooo
boswell why
letsgoo
longest 2 seconds ever
what
lol boz
bosgod
fuck yeah boz
there we go
this is farce
atta baby bozgod
hahahahahahahah oh my god
lol
id have bet my house he missed it good on boz

2020 keeping up the weird streak
holy fuck
holy fuck
boswell lets go
bozgod
out of the loop why was big ben not playing
dong shot
bosgod
whats the news with big ben
whos our 3rd string qb btw is duck still there
second half
why did boz not dance on the star after that kick
thank goodness
i stepped away at about the 2 minute warning did we get a pick or something
amari cooper doesnt deserve his madden x factor
i expected 5 sacks in this game weve gotten 1 and close to another
tackling is hard
our defense like butter
still nothing man
this team just didnt show up to play a winning formula this is just ridiculous
tony fucking pollard
i guess this is the bend not break d
its like our defense is still gassed from last week
ebron is not great at blocking
need a stop so bad
if they score on this drive its over
i need a dub got money on this to top it off lmao last leg of my safe parlay i shouldve known though lmao
its time for renegade
the one time we actually play for the pass there
might as well just let them score at this rate
i swear im about to go destroy something this is fucking pissing me the fuck off
where the fuck is our run defense today
sick
i cant complain about that one thats just zeke making a play
lol i thought they were prepared to not play down
great job 97
wrap up and drive
wrap up and drive
its alright they will get the first down on this
vince cannot cover
why the fuck do we keep dropping tj into coverage
feels like teams have been able to move the ball pretty much at will all season outside of cleveland
these defensive schemes with all of the lbs 5 yards off the line need to go
zero pressure on the qb
theyre just not getting much pressure dupree or watt needs to get home
can we play a nickel im sick of seeing lbs sitting on wrs in coverage
getting single blocked by backup lineman
everyone play renegade in 321
im about over sports
yes spillane on lamb

cal heyward is such a beast
the team thats playing right now sucks so bad lol
a sack right here would be great
seriously im out of words theres no excuse for any of this
motherfucker
good shit 97
short
im scared
if ben cant get us a dub here criticism probably valid love the guy but these things force you to ask questions
theres no sugar coating this shit this is fucking awful
how in the fuck did he beat baltimore and tennessee back to back just to come out with this
i thought we were very bad against the run last week because of the defensive game plan to contain lamar

but it looks like that game was not a one off
rudolph was dogshit last year but i genuinely feel like we had more of an intermediate pass game this year it feels like this year its a deep ball 40 yards down the field or a 2 yard drag
last two times we played them we trailed by 10 in the 4th and ultimately won
only thing that makes sense for the ds performance is that the cowboys chose a guy who hasnt started in like 3 years hard to gameplan for someone you dont know
with how our o is playing we need a td in the first couple plays of this drive because our d also isnt giving us favors we cant keep having dallas waste 6 minutes of the clock
i want to die
lets go was all juju that drive
thank you juju
juju is the big winner on that drive
he ruined that db lmao sent him stumbling to timbuktu
cowboys get yet another one on us in the trenches
of fucking course
of course
would be nice if we could stop somebody
wow randy gregory was dumb there youre still winning dude
hope he doesnt miss the kickoff
juju tried to pull the to celebration
we cant have anything nice today
makes me fucking sick
my one gripe with special teamskicking blocked fgspats shouldnt really be considered misses sometimes they are the fault of the kicker but most of the time the kicker cant really prevent that like if you put tucker on a team with a weak oline he would miss a lot more from blocks not from lack of skill
feel like that should have been reviewed he was close to stepping out
unreal
out special teams is absolutely destroying us what on earth
if we lose we deserve it
you have to be fucking kidding me
this is one of the worst special team performances by any team i have ever seen
tomlining
just fucking kill me now and put me out of my misery
offense check defense check kicking check add special teams to steeler failing today
cant even watch
this coaching staff is just so fucking stupid sometimes unbelievably stupid
lmfaooooo gotta love this team
so many blocks in the back on that return
guess my pooping mojo is gone
jesus fucking christ enough already
told yaaaaa we arent that good
just kick it out of the fucking endzone my god
this is unbelievable you pooch kick it to the left side and dont cover the left sideline wtf
this game does not want to be won
lol what a fucking nightmare
this team is going to be the death of me
what the fuck
shouldve traded for gilmore
this is really embarrassing man wtf is this
reminder this is a 4th string qb
im very worried
special teams is so dookie
hold them to 3 and still need one td anyway come on
thank god lets goooooo
lets goooo minkahhhhhh
please not us
flag
god dammit man
thank fucking god
phew
pain
fitzpatrick
we can manage that lfg minkah
make them pay
thank fucking god
at least no score for dallas
we took big advantage of their olineman dropping out of the race ill take it
anyone think romo is doing a good job tonight
rtp please no
holy shiiiit pleeeaaase
fitzmaaaaaaagic
woooow i wish minkah would have stayed in the end zone on that one but hey well take it
whos ball
also watch a reply terrible call holy shit i dont usually like to complain about refs but weve been hosed
that wasnt a blind side
refs have been so bad this game
great work
99 yard mvp drive
you just know this somehow has chris boswell 50 yard gamewinning field goal written all over it
moving the ball well here
why can offsides be declined but not false starts

incomplete pass
jesus christ
im back boys only 2 inches of snow
oh christ

jaylon smiths arms are huge

they just want to keep the game interesting they do this every week
super bowl teams will find a way to win


no matter the circumstances

catch the ball ebron sheesh
we got this
ebron you dropped it

dont stand there like you the man
claypool had a lane there why did he toss it to ebron

ben feels uncomfortable throwing left and i think the d knows it
lets get a safety
cant believe im saying this but our pass rush is too slow
lets go defense
our defense and special teams to blame today
fuel almost spent
too east for dallas too too easy already near midfield and time ticking and ticking
im so glad we picked up williamson jesus
theyre running all over us
steve nelson is so scary when its time to tackle the rb lol
and thats a stop
yeah baby
ray ray needs a big run back here mannn
game winning drive
this is coming down to a fg isnt it
lmao

lmao what an absolutely shitty call
bonk
some luck

johnson lost his mouth guard go back and pick that up bud
johnson baby
seeing mccarthys mask makes me uncomfortable
johnson is so bad once he catches the ball just run straight
johnson baby
djjj
holy fuck diontae
great play dont score too fast though
wow what an ugly set of plays i dont know why ben cant hit anything beyond 15 yards anymore when his arm is still a cannon glad they finally called something when ben gets hit for once
just torch the clock kick a field goal to win it and call it a day

my fucking heart
stay in bound rookie
i thought they were gonna challenge that
get conner in the game man
keep the clock running please
stay in bounds claypool
diontaethats my guuuuy
hes out fuck
i like ben was not in a hurry
wow johnson just gave me a shot of adrenaline i might have to furiously push my shit out on the next commercial tbh
deeeeeeejayyyyyyyy
guys are we uhhhhhh getting calls
goddamn it stay in bounds lol
stay on bounds
why didnt mccarthy challenge that wow a gift
run the clock
just spike the ball so they cant review
physically im tired mentallyemotionally im drained
lfggg boyssssss
did i miss something happening to conner
eric lebron
ebron jump
lets fucking go
i need to change my pants
do not at all let them have a chance to run this kick off back
should have stayed in claypool
ebron 1000 iq play
tony romo literally called that play lol
ebron i just hope scoring quickly doesnt come back to haunt them gotta trust the defense though
we are so fucking lucky this week better get our head out of our ass i dont want to see any positivity after the game
going for 2 is the best option
its happening
ebrooooon
nice but too much time on the clock
go for 2
boss move
leaaaap
stay in bounds claypool
ebron
fucking right
go for 2
go for it
ah fuck
lets go d get fucking nasty
lets fucking goooooooo we find a way
get that two
ben a little lower there buddy
one d stop and its done
i trust our pass rush to end this game keep bud tj out of coverage please
lets goooooo deefeeennnssse
time for the d to get up
man we needed that
we miss the 2 point and this thread already calling it a loss and we should fire tomlin lmao
thank fucking god
lets go defense
we finally have the lead now all we have to do is keep it
god this team gives me anxiety lmao thank god ebron is ridiculous now the defense has to pull out the nipple clamps on em
so a pass to the corner of the endzone wasnt an option on that play it was all inside slants
not pi
whats eating garret grapetj
of course
is conner hurt or benched
good idea to blast the kick out of the end zone
my facial expression during this game is about the same as that progressive sign guy i am just dead inside
welp not a good start
should be working but had to get in there after that ebron td

how was todays game tho
sutton gets those man
that was almost it
one stop please
lets go defense
sutton still could have caught that
how was that not blown down lol
same thing next week boys
lets go defense
he was in grasp
never in doubt
the defense finally gets the pass rush going
lets fucking gooooo
cam murdered that lad
lets goooooo
defense took my energy and used it well
weird game
and thats how you treat the fourth string qb that should have been happening all afternoon
i mean with the fouls they called probably should have tried to protect gilbert
i knew we could do it
cam is a bad man
we dem boyz
fuck yes
cameron just lifters that dude
ive never been so happy to be wrong still not the way you want it to go
thats my shit
cam lifts weights
hugeeeee stop d
you love to see it
never worried not once obviously the standard is the standard
lets fucking go

tj
oh sweet baby jesus
just protect the ball
we were all so fucking mad before lmao
tj watttttt

cameron heywardddd
ill take it
ugly win is a win
what a turnaround

didnt lose in the trap game

if you took the points tough break i dont blame you
tony romo can suck a dick
cam said please sit down
now the real question is why tf were we not blitzing this guy the whole game defense played so conservative
defense really hasnt been that bad two tds given up two takeaways two sacks i dont like the amount of rushing yards tho
the steelers are the comeback kids
lets go
barring some flukey bullshit it looks like we preserve our win streak and our 25 point streak
wtf are they doing
go for it
why
what are they doing
the offense can never just end the game
oof
why no field goal
watch that cost us the game
hold on what the fuck
cant get one yard okay
jesus christ my heart
what the fuck
there a chance well ever see romo coach
horrible decision
romo has a good point there
mothfucker
fuck conner
lets go d
pls god
why not shoot a fucking field goal lmao
im like fred sanford about to go to elizabeth over here watching this team should be an olympic endurance sport
always heartburn
ok defense take my energy 1 more time please
hes out
guess we dont get the useless accolade of 25 or more for the first 8 games
jfc come on
wow
stupid stupid decision
every game gotta be a nail biter huh
i think he tried to slide a little early
this is why i didnt say anything yet



here we go
why not
lamb is going to be a good one
jezus fuck
um
they just cant make it easy
please go please
wtf why
wtf kick the field goal
fuck seriously
of course is coming down to the wire
how does that happen
fuck this play calling fuck it unbelievable
can we just play the browns
i just dont get how a field goal isnt kicked there and if you go how is it not a sneak
wtf is going on
why the fuck
jesus lol i dont know what the problem is specifically but this run game gives me no confidence
oh jesus christ
cmon cmon please defense clutch this up please
his heels landed out of bounds
oh god
tf
i think my butthole has actually closed up at this point
lets go defense
stupid motherfuckers
come on defense get another sack
afraid of a pi call
lets go defense
didnt we just do this
please no
romo just willing the cboys
yo i dont feel good about this
edmunds

doesnt even try for the ball there
lets go defense
do we play renegade again lol
lets go defense
that the hold lol
prevent defense
we are getting held like crazy no calls
they gonna score
the time the time
wheres the hold
lets go defense
holy deja vu
well lamar failed with this opportunity lets see how gilbert does
oh thank god
win
wow
lets goooo

every steelers game
hell yeahhhhhhhhgh
i was wrong by 1 point
cant wait for the next two games
lets gooooo
80
this team gives me more scares than any horror movie ive seen
can i get a hell yeah
lets goooooooooo
if we lose this game i dont wanna hear shit from anybody that were a sb team
were down 130 against a team thats 26 with a fourth stringer oh and were supposedly 70
is this the day where our season basically ends i dont care if we go 160 or 97 with rudolph we wont score a point in the playoffs
no chance he has the distance
lol if he couldnt make it from 54 yards he prolly wont make it from 59

edit damn homie proved me wrong lmao
so bens injury looks reeeeeally likely to be and lcl injurysprain depending on the severity grade 1 he could come back if its higher than that idk if you can play through that and he would be out idk whether him playing on it was good or not as that may mean its either completely torn and he couldnt feel any pain or its a low grade sprain and he is just a beast
our defense is overrated i dont wanna hear any of you optimistic people claim we are a great team both sides of the ball were inconsistent and not that good
i love that no one is defending this bullshit its q3 and they continue to allow the cowboys to drive

this is a loss they cant play on offense or defense ive lost faith in this team over one game like fuck you cant even beat a fucking 4th stringer ridiculous
shut the fuck up you bastards that was a good call
we have zero intermediate passing game
youd think we were 26 according to these comments
explain this field position they got called for an illegal block in back at around their own 20 so the ball should be on their own 10

x200b

edit they just showed the replay it was the dallas 15 yard line penalty is supposed to be from the spot of the foul not the end of the play so it should have been half the distance and ball on about the dallas 7 they were off by like 60 yards
i called that long throw dumbass ben he cannot complete the long throws
rudolph is fuckin terrible
rudolph sucks rectum
losing 136 at halftime to a team thats 26 with their fourth stringer playing take it as you want but we arent that good
steelers couldnt beat my sons pop warner team due to steelering our coaching staff is absolute trash this is getting old
they are going to fg us to death because our offense is absolute trash
this team fucking sucks lol
is this game thread more dramatic than usual or has it been that long since weve had a bad game
ive seen enough dionte for one season
wont win any playoff games with this offense
were really about to lose to the fucking cowboys
i know it looks we are gonna win but i have a really bad feeling about this
no fg attempt what a fucking bum ass coach
god damn i miss zeke on my buckeyes

snatched defeat from the jaws of victory today boys dont even care that we won the asterisk next to that win is larger than the fucking numbers good lord i hope they figure out the play calling and special teams because that shit is gonna bite us in the ass again
play stupid games win stupid prizes dallas

shouldve just let the man kick
gonna make a scrub look like a god
trap
its insane how we manage to waste timeouts after a few minutes every single game awesome
smh this defense
people at work said i was crazy when i said this game would be closer than it needed to be and we would likely drop it
this is about what i expected typical steelers playing down to their opponents
faking an injury should be a penalty
3rd and 13 dallas about to get a td knowing the steelers
room sucking dallas dick all day like he did baltimore last week
silver blue man bad


black gold man good
we can realistically lose out
i thought this year was different but its the same old steelers we may still get a first round bye but its one and done in the playoffs
looks like all the critics were right
our defense is fucking garbage
my godddddd this is sad
this is why i was worried about this game we dont travel west well and normally struggle against the cowboys
sutton give me a break you pussy
oh chase thats the second today my dude
you gotta catch that
man ben just doesnt have the deep ball anymore sad to see
boswell taketh
missed 2 extra points but made a 59 yard field goal lol
vander esch always seemed like a bitch to me
that was a gift get off the dudes face mask
i really dont trust boswell but holy shit
i dont know if i trust boswell to hit the game winner if it comes down to that
theyre gonna run this 1st down and then torch us over the top
our defense is so bad we blitzed and couldnt get to him and we got bailed out by the overthrow
cowboys trying so hard to lose but we wont let them we built different
were gonnna lose the game
they didnt deserve this game at all id be pissed with that roughing the passer if im a cowboys fan
the refs looked really good in the 4th quarter vs the cowboys
if we made one pat and hit that fg it would be game over thanks boz
71
real steeler fans here smh
i hate to say trap gamebut
ben vick lol
i hate romo lmao
why throw it into double coverage ben is so inaccurate on the deep ball
gonna be one of those games where we hate catching the ball eh
damn mapletron just dropped a td
and so it begins
lol here we fucking go
here we go
what the fuck
hef fucking brady
i think my minkah jersey is cursed the d seems to play sloppy every time i have it on take it off and boom they play better sigh
lmao gonna be a long fucking day getting worked by this team because our defense has zero killer instinct
pittsburgh d what the game started we thought this was sunday night game we better get a sack
we made the stop cmon lets go people
did ben tell out what the play was gonna be there
this is sad lol
yall need to stop worrying only 3 drives into the game come on now
mccloud must be injured
about time ben started calling the plays
is conner hurt again why isnt he out there i literally just traded for him in one of my fantasy leagues
sometimes i look at randy fichtner and i think yes

but most of the time i look at him and i think why
uninspiring
honestly we were overdue for a classic trap game what is this a 4th string qb
this is the tomlin special
jesus christ can we get our shit together
70 is a fluke huh i mean come on what are they doing
can we just never play another toilet team ever again besides the browns and bengals
every stillers fan feeling like cassandra right now
dont why anyone thought we were going to blowout the cowboys i mean we only beat the broncos by 4
pretenders
this is normal dont worry
um
thankfully for me my happiness died when virginia tech lost to liberty yesterday you cant hurt me this time steelers
there was a false start
cowboys gonna run up the score lmao ben getting to break records
neutral observer connor looks like hes running in slow motion he isnt good
lol cowboys showed up to play
true steelers game right here
bro what the fuck
wow fml
ok maybe we are gonna lose
what the fuck is this commercial
im so fucking tired of this
i guess ben likes to fight from being behind
ben has no deep ball this year its sad
ben only throws bombs nowadays to bait dpis
and now we are fucked gg guys
the wheels on the bus come falling off falling off falling off
lol
why is it when we tank the entire fucking team tanks
fuckin boz come on son
freaking boz
lucky we are not down by two scores
just play rudolph and sit ben if he isnt badly hurt fingers crossed he needs to rest for the bengals next week this game isnt worth it
lol holding end of half
he has the velocity of a dad at a tailgate
no zip behind that rudolph pass
fucking grabass
let me guess holding
juju saving mason there
no ben no chance
jesus could mason have thrown that any slower
who the hell called a turnover forcing mason to finish the half
bring in dobbs
why didnt juju run straight he literally ran into the left to try and truck a defender
this is sad bout to be losing at half time to a 26 team lol
thats too far for boz
for once in our fucking seasons can we just play a garbage team and not fucking play shitty
why do teams still do this dumb freeze the kicker shit lol it does nothing
fake fg
2018 boswell back on the menu
lets drag this shit out longer
just throw a hail mary
cursed score
boswell can make fgs in shit conditions but cant make an extra point inside a dome on artificial turf wat
boz should heave it to the end zone on a fake
curse the gods
fire randy
ill ask again can we please get a turnover
bud is not having a great game
outplayed
does tj have a limp
lol if gingers had a soul that dude in the stands just lost it
i really want to know what are percentage is on the deep ball this year
embarrassing
they arent gonna win this game playing like they are theyve shown they dont know what the fuck theyre doing its the fucking cowboys the fucking cowboys
terrible in virtually every aspect punting is the only positive
plenty of times guys i know it hasnt looked like it today but this is a top o for bottom d
cowboys the new raiders to us
thats gonna cost dallas i feel like
we got this leggo
for anyone who cares about the spot on this game the steelers were 135 favorites hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
does they not know the steelers cant dominate inferior opponents
i just remembered steelers had a decent cordinator and our offense looked fun this is debatably the most boring and bland offense in the nfl
holding on ebron smh
jujuuuuuuuuuuu
juju is rockstar
juju smith schusterrrrr

fuck this special teams coach leave his ass home trash
turning off see you next weekend gang
this game is fantastic
this is a debacle
bruh what
fucking danny smith
please fire danny smith the special teams play is pitiful
are run defense is trash without bush
which team is 26 again
youd think that youd want to avoid kicks being returned when playing a team with john fassel as the st coach but were the steelers so we need big brain plays
what fucking team is this

i swear that we dont practice for bad teams we think were to good and just ignore them im fucking over this kind of play someone needs a foot in the ass and it needs to start with our coaches
seriously what are we doing on defense this entire game no pressure no run stop no pass stop its crazy
fucking flag
game over
great now we get it on the 1 fitz couldnt just take a knee
get your shit together nantz
ftlog please let us make a deal for the jets first round pick
game over
vander esch is a bitch for that punch
what a piece of shit wtf
lets run the ball a little
vander esch just tossed a punch
possible ejection
yo wtf vander straight punched
thad castle losing it out there understand why bms never won a natty with him as captain

alex moran for life
what does outside the numbers mean
actually cut this whole special teams unit they almost blocked that shit again
we cant stop them
the blitz just isnt working surprisingly this qb is picking it to bits
this isnt good
plenty of time 3 time outs and 2 min bens moving the ball all we need to fg
ik they let those go and ik ab def did it a shit ton but i hate how coop only got separation there cause he pushed off
i actually have a heart problem so i think this might be my last steelers game
fuck you clay poo
cant win em all
of fucking course ben throws it poorly

edit it okay
3 and out typical steelers
how are they not calling the grab and shove on claypool there
announcer i cant believe it

me either i cant believe it lets not shit away these 4 downs too
yes throw 3 straight balls to the guy who has dropped almost all of them today lol
right in the face
that wouldnt get called 15 years ago but it was to the face so i agree with the call in 2020
man i love the steelers and all but that roughing the passer call is horrible for the league
claypool needs to catch with his hands not his body
dont know why juju isnt getting targetedthis isnt chases game right now
claypool couldve reeled that in thats like the third catchable ball he didnt handle
almost want to claim randy is calling good plays we just cant execute but fuck randy anyway
if i were a ref and a coach came up to me and started losing his shit all the time id flag him i get being grumpy but damn have a little composure
we dont deserve this win if we get it that call on bens facemask is technically correct but holy shit is that a bail out call
do not trust our defense
scored too quickly ive seen this before
cumshot baby
we sucked ass today but got the dub all that matters
oh look were running it
80 you fuckers hahahahahhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
im not relaxing with this down to special teams
im fucking done
tomlining
watch us lose on a tebow to demaryius thomas slant route
whyyyyy
heel was out of bounds
if we lose it will be on tomlin alone
lmao incoming td and tomlin wont say anything meaningful about that decision
cmon tj
thanks for the heart attack tomlin
every fucking week
im ashamed right now
hahahahah none of the fucking steelers look like theyre gonna win hahahhaa
yoooooooooo
our defense is so fucking overrated
hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
our defense is so bad we are not the best defense in the league
yup 100 trap game incoming
this defense isnt good
dont worry guys some crazy ass splash play will happen to save these sorry ass coaches from being blamed for how awful at football they are
ben shoulda retired so we could have gone and got someone with this defense
so boswell is making 59 yarders and missing multiple extra points in a game sounds like harrison butker
pathetic tomlin absolutely pathetic
does the steelers defense know the word consistency play well one week and play like shit against the fucking cowboys of all teams

edit as soon as i said that there was an intmy comments never age well
is it just me or does johnson suck once he catches the ball he tries to do way too much
lmaooo we really bouta lose
lmao this team is a first round exit
why tf do you not call a play before the 2 minute warning little shit like that is just stupid
please stop playing down to the competition
maybe ben should fucking practice more during the week this wasting the entire first half shit is garbage
apart from awful play calling i know this is unheard of on the forum but ben has been slight avarage just above duck and rudolph but thats not saying much we should go back to short passes for 34 yards out quick and just tied the shit out of them
i dont see the issue were playing like a tomlin coached team
probably gonna be a three and out here because why not lol
fuck this cracka claypool go beat his ass
this is the worst defense weve had this decade
refball
we dont deserve to win lol
steelers are so bad fire tomlin fire fichtner fire rooney fire heinz fire the allegheny and fire the primanti brothers and ben should retire
this is a one and done team
strength of schedule finally showing
i just want one bad season so we can fire this entire garbage coaching staff
we should trade for fitzpatrick even if bens okay lul
tank and hopefully we can get a low teens pick
typical game thread yall know teams dont go undefeated right
fuck that white fool
the sad thing is this isnt even the least bit surprising if this steelers team cant beat this absolute dirty toilet of a cowboys team just pack it up for the year cause theyre not beating the chiefs either
absolute meltdown what the fuck
that was a fucking false start
having mccarthy as hc looking fucking sexy rn
im so fucking done
mike tomlin will not win coach of the year because for some reason he cant beat the absolute worst teams in the league this game is over in the first half for good coaches instead we are down two scores to a high school team
hahahahahahahaha
romo is royally pissing me off
chick fila advertising on a day theyre not even open lmao
maybe thatll wake your ass up ben
ben cant throw deep anymore no one in the league will respect it
take him out
we arent that good
that looks like that outside of the knee looks like an mcl
special teams defense offense all horrible all fucking terrible
duck dynasty

is hodges still with the organization
this team needs to get its fucking shit together this is so fucking ridiculous
wait why didnt dallas just decline the penalty
good teams dont lose to shit teams take it for what its worth
yikes losing to the cowgirls
still think well win
wtf chase
claypool more like claypoopypants
what the fuck boz
when we lose by 2 i might cry
this team fucking sucks horse cock
we lost
we cant score here offense is terrible and well be at the 5 or some shit because minkah wanted to run it for some reason lol
how did rudolph do
claypool you bum

call me crazy but i go for it
stupid motherfuckers take the field goal seriously
we dont really deserve to win this one so whatever happens happens
i want the steelers to win but that was a bullshit unnecessary roughness call
yep were steelering already
and so begins the steelering
we always play down to our opponents
mahomes is going to pick this defense apart im really not looking forward to it
this dude is better than ben
its the nfl youre going to concede some points no matter what im not super worried about the defense just yet

im a bit more concerned our qb is washed and were stuck with his buddy oc
worst coaching in the league always shows in these type of games
classic tomlin coached team underprepared as usual
59 yards ahahahahaha just go for it instead
edit fuck ok then
should the steelers have drafted jalen hurts or jacob eason to replace mason rudolph
may as well onside kick it because tomlin and butler are morons and cant stop a nosebleed on defense
nice ball at the 2 yard line we aint driving 98 yards
off topic but our team needs cheer leaders
yeah my brother and i are both yelling at them to stop celebrating youre losing to the 26 cowboys you have zero room to do any celebrating
ive been pissed at pittsburgh for voting in joe biden but if we go 80 ill forgive the city
removed
its funny to see the tomlin apologists squirm its never tomlins fault as much as i hate seeing the steelers lose watching the apologists reach to blame everyone but tomlin is quite comical

tomlin develops the game plans with the coordinators you doofuses
i said the super bowl hope was done once bush was done for the year thats looking pretty accurate at this point
tomlin should be fired for incompetence if they lose this game there is no way you worry about a guy blocking a fg go up 8 and win the game
lol here we go the mike tomlin special coach the team to try and coast and get eaten alive by a shit team
cmon tomlin tell me you prepared this team
doesnt matter if the steelers come back or not the defense has big weaknesses that they cant make up for and theyre coached by a jackass who doesnt know how to use his best players i dont see how this team can stop mahomes or score enough to keep up with him any top 10 qb dismantles the secondary

mike tomlin thinks this is acceptable
he just missed a 54 why not do a hail mary
interception from ben is kind of our way now or juju 50 years run after catch to fumble
say what you want but my negativity is a game winning formula lol its like it kicks the steelers into high gear
this is what i get for thinking that 100 was possible after beating the ravens i should have known better

steelers gonna steeler
wow we fucking suck
lmao someone tell me we are a super bowl team
im sorry but tomlin is at fault for what ive seen so far i love the guy but theres no reason we should be down 10 fucking embarrassing
not a sb team

oh shit is it 30 seconds left in the 4th no stfu cry baby whiners
about time we lost tbh
thank god we have a defense lol that 70 is a bit misleading offensively last week and today weve been dreadful might have had more offense last year and thats saying something
sit ben rudolph got this
we need a new kicker next season
we suck
how in the fuck does offsetting penalties not result in playing whatever the outcome of the down was
so we are gunna believe he can make it from 5 out lol
im happy but the false start on a kick rule is dumb
remember when people were saying this team was special
lmfao fuck this garbage i have to go watch arizona v miami at least that game is a real fucking game
claypool looking like a bum this game
if we win this they should take it away because we dont deserve it lol
literally 1 step forward 2 steps back every play this team that showed up todays not getting past the divisional win or lose
johnson has no moves at all this dude stinks
this team is so fucking overrated lol
told you guys we arent that good
americas team is going down
steelers will win by 50 lol
elliot continues to run all over us
terrible
fuck
lol i cant believe he they just marched 65yds good on highsmith to hold it to 3 but i am dissatisfied
remember in the water boy when they are playing in the bourbon bowl and in the first half and louisiana defense is dominating the muddogs because they are reading the football for dummies that coach kline uses thats how it feels when fichtner gets in 2nd and 3rd and long defense knows exactly what play he is going to call really annoying we have so many weapons wish we could do some imaginative plays more
jesus
this special teams has no idea what theyre doing
dont let fucktner call a fucking play again
enjoying seeing antmac out there a lot
its happening
is conner hurt
yikes this is big bad
they are dominating us
why do i feel like we didnt prepare this game whatsoever
we fucking suck
this is pathetic
fire everyone
garrett gilbert was signed two weeks ago off the aaf and the cowboys have a historically bad defense and the the cowboys o line only has 1 starter in
you guys are mad at what im saying but cannot deny we do not look like a jv team
i wonder when were going to wake up
bengals and jags next two weeks after this we couldve started 100 smh
welp here we go wondering when we would shit the bed against a bottom barrel team in classic tomlin era steelers fashion we were a bit overdue for it so far this season but looks like here it is
we look like a fucking high school team
stop letting fichtner call the plays now jesus fuck
wtf
hahahahabahabababababahahahahahahahajajahahahahahahajahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
hahahahahahahaahhaa if we lose randy should be fired
garbage
if you watched this game and were told one team was 70 and one was 26 you would not be surprised if you were told which team was 70 vs 26 you would be shocked
no block in the back on that what the actual fuck
someone definitely needs thrown out on their ass this is fucking so fucking stupid fuck this team
what the fuck lmfao
he cant even hit a drag route
guys have some faith

maybe i just never noticed before but are there more commercials than normal this year
if hes hurt the seasons over
get him out
they best draft a solid qb in the offseason
we have mason if we need him
if ben is hurt trade for darnold now
boo boo ben
worshington
would have been nice to have some plays like these 25 minutes ago
lol fail on all three phases today of course hed miss the extra point lofl
the gasp i just let out
that should not have worked
cmon rudy
probably holding
that was lucky maybe
calling blocked fg for td now

edit glad it was wrong just felt inevitable
i hate his stupid face
what is this fucking josh scoby
nobody should be surprised
hahahahahaha
oh mama
announcers on my stream saying ben isnt coming back
bro wtf
this defense sucks all around but the run defense is particularly egregious
steven nelson needs to be cut wasnt even close to tackling zeke
lol pitiful today i guess they need a loss to come back down
so the defense was other teams playing down to us noted
whoever sent ben in early needs to make an apology to every steeler
i believe it tony
okay backyard ben time right guys
neil odonnell
right through the wickets
hey bince make a fucking play
fuck sake
of course
juju worrying about his celebration
well we are losing in all 3 phases especially special teams we are gunna have to own this if we lose we looked pretty flat all around no excuses
i wish i could take back all that effusive praise ive been heaping on this run defense i feel like a damn fool
fuck these refs man
fuck my ass minkah
now they gonna call pi lmfao
why is ben telling receivers what to run how do we have 0 plays
ejection time
personal foul fuck dallas
vander esch dirty bastard
man should they go for this
maybe stop blitzing the qb
our cbs are atrocious tonight
our defense is not the best defense in the league please stfu if you actually think it is
dpi
fucking whew
i think dionte was out of bounds therebut im happy about it
stop being a crybaby tony
too much time im nervous
fuckkkk defense
defense get your shit together

i hate tony romo


is anyone really surprised ive said we arent that good lol do not be surprised
removed
boswell josh scobee
this team fucking sucks nobody defend them they can hardly even beat the cowboys

tomlin may be the dumbest head coach on the he fing planet hes rah rah af but my god is he dumber than a sack of bricks got soooo lucky
i think im willing to accept ben has no deep ball anymore
this offense is embaressing
removed
tonight on days of our steelers


but wtf is wrong with ben
this would be the worst 80 team in nfl history
james connor fucking stinks
remember when all you guys were coming at me for saying we arent that good defense is overrated offense sucks and we arent a sb team
we are not a 70 team
rooneys should honestly just throw about 15 million a year at lincoln riley and see what he says tomlin aint it 3 playoff wins in a decade with a hof qb time to go
who knew that garret gilbert would be playing decent
ben is faking the shit out of that injury
imagine if we had a coach that knew how to make games easier
if mccarthy can do this with a 4th string qb and terrible team imagine what he could do with this steelers team
putting the game back into the hands of our bottom tier defense gulp
why the fuck would they take the penalty lmao

alright i get it they had no choice
fuck you claypool
fire tomlin at half im not even joking this is not the type of mentality and culture we need on our team
this is going to get ugly soon
hahahaga
best d in the league stayed in the locker room
let the playing down begin
fucking cowards
wow were really not that good lol i do not see us beating the chiefs or seahawks

im just chilling today wanna win but dont matter either way lol
fucking bums i guess they are taking the week off
can we just take the l and end the game here save us all some time
tomlin did absolutely nothing to prepare this team i see probably told them it was a guaranteed w

we are not a super bowl team
cancel the season
im gonna switch off
landry jones sighting
why the fuck didnt we get jameis god fucking damn
terrible throw
boz going back to his old ways does not fare well for us this reminds me all to much of the raiders game
our run d has been really questionable recently
how did this team beat the ravens and titans lol
another ben overthrow
hits a 59 yarder

misses two pats
bens accuracy is worse than helen keller throwing the football

3rd and 10 automatic conversion incoming
wtf boz
cut steven nelson please
boswell is so garbage lol

ive been a steelers fan for looonnngggg time and when the inferior team gets big plays off early we take a l ive seen it too many times but lets have faith yall
unbelievable
do you all realize that the coordinators meet with the head coach every week and talk about the game plan its tomlins fault it always is
season is over
seasons over
watt has been a worthless addition
thas gonna be a hold on us edit nm glad im wrong just expect them to call shit on us always
fuck mike tomlin
you guys are all saying it was a bad tomlin call cause hes black s
theres people out there that still think mike tomlin is a top 5 head coach lmfao
ben looks bad as usual
i think those tomlin apologists and truthers might be quiet after tonight
we are the worst team in the nfl
we are not that good


i dont think weve ever deserved to lose more than right now
nobody is going to say anything about the bs roughing the passer that was called on ben but the horse collar on gilbert was a legit play gimme a fucking break how can you be this obvious as a ref and get away with it
now elliot begins running all over us we are so fucked

just call the game man give us the loss for a bye week id rather that than watch the rest of this shit
boswell just made me break two of my controllers dumb fuck
i hate mike tomlin
guaranteed turnover touchdown for dallas right here
tomlin is a bad coach
they continue to run all over us how sad is remit their third string qb can have a td in their opening drive and ours overthrows receivers and kills the drive
you guys look like hot garbage tonight
see you guys next year
ben bailing tomlin out again 13th year now
its not the players tomlin just sucks
this game is over our offense cant stop with lame incompletions and their qb can complete those

our season is over
put in mason this game is over anyways
should have declined bitches lol
cowboys fan here refs won this game for you which is sad cause were absolutely terrible

your hands have fur
how many steelers fans
i always love watching the steelers play the cowboys because i get to see my two favorite teams play 1 the steelers and 2 whoever is playing dallas this week
good for you man

i hope you both enjoy the experience cheers
is that the actual towel over your face thats gotta be hard to get air in lol
enjoy it guys
damn super lucky i yet to see my first game

my wife bought us tickets for this game but then covid happened i hope you guys had a blast

never too early for christmas
james conner having a bit of a look there
from pittsburgh moved to foxboro ma haha i held my own as a steeler fan moved to denver i still hate the color orange to this day lol now im in new hampshire its so fun to see how many steeler fans there are all over the us and world love it
go steelers
try israel

the cowboys always wear white uniforms
because everywhere is a home game for us
cowboys home colors are white and steelers away is also white
because we own the cowboys
i googled this once dallas always wears white at home so the opposing team wears their own full colors it was an ownership decision back in the day so that fans in dallas didnt see the same exact blue vs white every home game
home team gets to pick their jerseys
cowgirls always wear white at home
removed
because its 3rd and 8 and he likes the extra cushion
two super bowl rings not a single season of his career as a starter without a winning record a slam dunk hof resume and an undefeated record this season all by doing what hes good at

thats why
i mean if claypool had 1 more step on him thats a td and he just trying to show off his bionic arm
defense should be trying to prevent a 1st down so it should be a good opportunity to take a shot riskreward
rather it be thrown over than under
better than an int
big ozzy osbourne fan
because our play calling is fucking retarded as shit for the first 2 quarters every fucking game we like to play down to opponent skill and play catch up dumb as shit



this looks like it is it out of stock rn though
that looks like the color rush hoodie

are you in pit now

there was a slight hold but he has to make that play anyways ben put that in his hands doesnt get much better than that

this is embarrassing as hell

im tryin lolol gooosefrabaaaaaa

yeah fucking pathetic
this is designed pkaycalling to throw off future essentials games
removed
houston wont be cutting watt theyll trade him
we dont need a dozen half assed posts on this
i could see this only if jj watt realllllly wanted to play with his brothers and thought we pyle win a super bowl next year conspiring with his family to get an organizational wink and nod to know they will trade for him and then jj not show up to camp and force a trade trade to steelers for a 4th round or later and then jj negotiates an extension and renegotiated his salary to lower than bud wants if we somehow go all the way or even just the afc title game bud will be out of the realm of affordability given our other signings jj would basically need to be had for 67mil a year at absolute maximum


run run pass kick
i hate randy with all my life we would be the best offense if ben called the plays
i mean we use the puff puff pass at my house so
there is no bigger myth in football especially in the modern game than run to set up the pass especially nowadays with all of these rpos where youre just trying to get a numbers advantage
ben throwing passes on first and second downs

steelers fans why run run pass
im fine with run run pass if you dont go with your rookie who is 58 208lbs and use your actual starting veteran rb who is 61 and 229lbs dont sub players before you have the game secured
i want our oc to be fired ben is a better oc by miles we were so efficient when he was calling plays the oc sucks he is awful i cant stand him
still dont know why they didnt kick a field goal at the end
lol its pass pass pass right now wtf is going on
just run the 07 patriots offense quick pass quick pass quick pass bubblesmoke a surprise run another quick pass and then chuck one long
this isnt even what happened idk what fucking games this sub watches i feel like im in a different reality on gameday half the time
conner hurt btw
why do they have to wait till the second half to turn it on though its like okayi guess we will play some football now
the offense is seemingly stuck in mud almost every game until the team gets behind or ben is allowed to go nohuddle and dictate the playcalls and pace

if i wanted to watch runrunpass id watch a kent grahamled steelers team
pass to lead run to win no need to fabricate balance that isnt going to be there
dunno it gets us into a hole where we go with an empty backfield playing ben ball which im alright with
and why on the 4th and 1 last offensive play for the steelers do they do a sweep run run offense wasnt working at all short passes were working for the most part clock is going to stop for change of possession regardless so incomplete pass is inconsequential if youre not going to kick a field goal at least do what brought you success the whole game
can i say 1 thing tho idk if it is ben or fichtner but the fuck it chuck it deep and pray for a dpi wasnt working for us this game
removed
not happening we always blow easy games we should win
i mean id like it if that happens unfortunately the steelers love to play down to the competition no offence
tbh i wouldnt be surprised if we win by like a last sec field goal

every game man love that catch up football and love playing down to opponent skill call stupid fucking plays until halftime then randy sphincter decides to do his job and call a decent play or three
damn i forgot the steelers have never overcome a slow start to win a game in franchise history were fucked
amen

they have a long history of it i actually like dallas chances of winning and that sucks to say

this is the most steelers shit ive seen in a while
this is the way
bold of you to assume mike tomlin can beat a team with a losing record

steelering
its steelers football come on u shouldve known this
first time
this is peak steelers
we all knew this was coming if you didnt see this coming you havent been paying attention the last 10 years or so
honestly its bad play calling they kept trying to force the run first half ben didnt have many chances to get going
exactly always playing down to the competition smh
what asshole is calling these plays
it was a win poor run offense missed tackles or maybe theyre just trying to give their fans heart attacks every week
were second half hussies
sums it up
what happened to our run game holy lord weve got ben how about we pass the ball a bit in the first quarter to open it up more
at least theyre not losing these games like they usually do
heres the good news we usually lose these trap games
exactly what i thought when we didnt kick the field goal at the end
you can call me a homer i am
but the refs kept this pretty close too
since when can a db tackle the receiver with the ball in the air
plenty of blame for offense defense and special team though
just glad to be bitchin about a win
was it a bad game gmt2 time falled asleep in the first quarter

he hasnt gained his winter weight yet but he does usually play better with a slight injury

heres hoping its not too serious
i said to myself that our qb was a badass for this

that one drive was 2019 all over again
when are the steelers going to invest in a good backup qb wtf this kid just doesnt have it he knows it the steelers know it and the world knows it
great meme thanks for the laugh
my heart cant take these close games pittsburgh dad is going to have a heart attack
the cowboys have a third stringer throwing ropes just get a kid who can stretch the field a little sheesh
any reindeer or duck can replace ben perhaps we can have something decent with dobbs that ofc is out smh
mark malone junior
oh nowwwww were all done with rudolph
yo honestly can we trade for gilbert gimme anyone else
why are we not starting dobbs over him
we deserved more we deserved duck
way better than duck or dobbs lots of backups suck btw
jesus christ every single game you fuckers love to bitch and moan about everything kid went 53 with 13 tds on his rookie season with one of the shittiest offensive squads weve had in decades cut him some slack and stop talking trash about your own team like were the jets or some shit
the coaches obviously are keeping him around for a reason you cannot judge a player based off 3 throws and we definitely have one of the top tier coaching staffs in the league he didnt play too bad until the concussion then his pocket awareness just became trash and he was afraid to get hit ill give him another shot
he deserved to get his chrome thunked
thats a weird picture of tomlin

why celebrate you are losing

why in the world do we keep dropping tj and bud in coverage they are the best pass rush duo in the league and it feels like we are not using them to their potential
robert spillane on ceedee lamb is the most insane thing ive ever seen whatever is causing this needs to stop
its because of the formations and shifts by the offense were trying to stay in our base defense to stop the run but theyre playing with 3 wr and forcing our backers into coverage
theyre hoping this pays off when he starts to really pressure in the 4th quarter
this is where the lack of bush is killing us we cant play nickel because their rushing game is strong and we dont have a coverage linebacker on the team anymore
because theyre linebackers doing linebacker things when we go to nickeldime they play edge which is really de and pretty much rush all the time pay attention to personnel presnap for both the o and d each play makes the game more fun and understandable
because the coaching staff decided to treat this game like a preseason game
because butler is a dumbass
so that the defense cant be entirely sure weather or not they will rush which can cause confusion
big brain butler thats why
feel like the team especially after 3 huge games are starting to look a lil bit weary and tired

we got a bye in week 3 but there wasnt any rest as the team practiced as normal
no this isnt our bye showing this is us playing down to our competition again
so 5 games in a row is showing it
it definitely factors in but it shouldnt matter in this game
80 we should play a pickup game during our bye week every year
were also on the last leg of a 3game road trip and had to travel a good bit to dallas

it matters that said dallas still shouldnt have been this much of a problem
this is by design playing they are half speed it seems just going through the motions prolly to protect themselves
the minute were double digit favorites to win game i know theres a 100 chance were gonna blow it

3rd and 1 let er rip
it has been very very bad every time he goes long my vagina tightens
this the funniest steelers meme imho

hey everyone im wondering what your favorite barrestaurant in baltimore is to watch games from
le couch in the northeast corner of your living room
stay the fuck home you assholes
dude keep yourself safe and stay inside covid is on the uptick right now and its not worth it to get sick for a football game
maxs taphouse
city limits

is this some kind of new teen titans
her dropping him is the pick rgiii threw
stay save and stay the fuck home
i really appreciate those of you are who willing to civilly discuss opinions about this

im going to continue to keep threads like this open for that exact reason above and to stay in line with the earlier announcement i made this year about sensitive topics in this sub

unless your comment is completely devoid of anything that adds to the discussion it likely will stick around to receive the subs updown votes
nflbitecom

stay home and watch for free drinks are cheaper at home as well
what about me i live in new zealand

jk we dont have bars to watch the nfl
a lot of these bars are being really responsible i wouldnt say someone should never patronize a barjust dont be stupid about it if my wife and i go out to grab a drink we just grab a table thats at outside and at a safe distance and be careful about it
itt a whole bunch of idiots that dont realize they can infect other people by going to these bars

good reminder op
ugh i was going to respond to some comments on this post but it would probably be like talking to a brick wall at this point people just continue to wear masks social distance and if you have to go to a bar make sure its outdoors
bears fan dropping by thank you i feel crazy with so many people actively trying to prolong this
the bottom of this thread is exactly why america has 200k dead in 7 months
i like pickles
im kinda glad the denver flock postponed gatherings
fuck coronavirus but stay safe and stay indoors
yeah reading comments here shows me exactly why the us has been a disaster handling this virus compared to other countries yall some dumb motherfuckers stay the fuck home
there are plenty of bars that are handling it safely and responsible i say go support them and if a bar is being careless then fuck em but really its not hard to protect yourself and everyone around you by following simple safety guidelines
i wish i could stay at home working weekend sucks especially now with covid protocals oh well
is there a discord for the sub that we can all join on game day and get drunk together
the last mf in america that should get the virus caught it lol yall niggas aint safe stay inside
so true i wish i was with each and every one of you cheering and cheersing its not the end of the world if you miss the game please be responsible we can overcome this virus together we are almost there if we put in half the work that these people neighbors family idols first loves randos at the gas station dedicate to this gamewe can overcome this adapt understand overcome thrive
1 come into this thread

2 scroll down to the bottom

3 get depressed
but not the protests though
ive just been having a bunch of people over to watch games that way we dont even have to halfass pretend to wear masks
whats your goal complete elimination of virus as a healthy 24 yo guy who lives in a studio apartment why cant i support my local bars let people live their lives and make their own choices
how about people make their own choices
dude positive rates are like 2 no deaths wear a mask and be respectful and youll be fine most places have outside seating as well
so i understand your argument that by going out to bars etc people can become carriers even if they arent sick themselves and infect others but if you arent going out to bars or these other places yourself then how are you in any danger if someone is that worried about becoming sick or contagious then they should be staying home full stop

the only argument i can see is that by going out to bars you increase your likelihood of becoming contagious and infecting people at essential businesses that people need to visit at that point though it seems like youre splitting hairs by telling people walmart is ok to go to but fuck you for enjoying a meal at a restaurant i think your real issue should be with your local governments for allowing nonessential businesses to operate not at the people visiting them within the rules set out by the governors

ill probably get downvoted but id be curious to hear others thoughts
i cant live a significant portion of my life in hiding from a virus ill wear a mask in public and keep small social circles but i cant stay in a bunker for a year
removed
question which scenario is more likely to give you covid

1 going to wal mart
2 going to watch football at a bar

reminder wal mart has been open this entire pandemic but walmart is essential nope you still run the risk of spreading it to others and getting it yourself life really does have risks and what if a vaccine doesnt come out until late next year please dont tell me your plan is to sit at home all day until then and preach others should do the same nope sorry that isnt going to happen m8

i totally get wearing a mask and distancing sure but come on as long as we wear masks we really oughta be able to go to a fuckin bar man as much as i wanna do my part to stop corona these people saying we shouldnt be going out and instead still staying at home all the time just seems so bizarre
removed

i love how nicaragua never closed anything down never changed anything and they are basically completely fine this virus has a 9999 recovery rate and everyone out here virtue signaling like they are actually saving someones life all the while the economy is dying hard and people are committing suicide and dying from 100 other things at exorbitant rates

just stop with these posts

removed

the first clip the stadium was packed with purple man i miss the fans
montana to rice manning to harrison koch to moore

all of those throws more difficult than mahommes touchdown passes tonight
all

look what happens when you dont get outcoached its crazy that the patriots had so
many defense players traded leave in free agency or optout but the coaching still helps them contain the chiefs that we couldnt even stop on third down smh i even think our defensive personnel is better but our coaching isnt
look what happens when you just run the ball down kcs throat instead of selling out for the air game after you go down a few points
very valid and depressing point lol refs just bailed them the fuck out tho
its the pass rushing kcs offense gets disrupted by it mahomes had all day against us which allowed all those deep routes to develop we had absolutely zero pass rush and its a huge achilles heel for us you can say we abandoned the run and we did but it wasnt going to matter based on how easy our defense made it for their offense
yea was just having this conversation with my brothers l we played horrible agaisnt chiefs and this pats game is proof
thats not pass rush thats good coverage

our dbs got lit up mahomes was throwing to wide open receivers as soon as he got the ball
absurd for once i agree with belichick

edit or an int either way shouldve been a turnover
mahomes now a confirmed golden boy two hand touch rules apply
yeah no more friendly gif wars with these bitches the chiefs are the new patriots mahommes whines and complains more than tom fucking brady
that was an interception these refs are trash
definitely an int he was throwing it away ironic seeing brady calls go against the patriots
when you play kc you play the refs next time we face them i want the ravens prepared knowing that absolutely nothing will go our way no use complaining about it
that was some bs
that was a bull call
that was reallllllllly bad
i hate the patriots but yeah that was bad literally everything goes mahomes way
if you wanna be them beat them this sub is soooo preoccupied with the chiefs
we should have looked just like the patriots running it down their throats and controlling the ball for the majority of the game its not that hard apparently
someone should show wink martindale this game as well
most likely wouldnt help because it has happened a couple times before last weeks game ravens tend to be up on their opponents in most games and he clearly doesnt adjust well outside the original game plan
the patriots pass rushers actually got home
2610 chiefs running the ball clearly worked wonders
i said this so many times in the game thread they dropped everyone into coverage and rushed three it was super effective too

for the life of me i cannot understand how wink let mahomes light us up
god this game is pissing me off the chiefs run d is terrible we should have slaughtered this team but we had horrible offensive and defensive game plans didnt run the ball on offense and blitzed way too much on defense
theyre doing what you have to do to contain the chiefs control the top with a strong running game and keep mahomes off the field for some reason in all of our losses we get spooked early abandon our strengths and try to compete in a shootout which mahomes will win 100 of the time
horrid refs as expected
bill and mcdaniels doing an amazing job against the chiefs so far if they had cam theyd be winning this game by a lot
hey look what happens when you run and commit to it 17 runs and 16 passes
holy shit im now more embarrassed our game against the chiefs
they said butker tucker lmfao
i think this is showing us just how much creativity on defense matters vs the chiefs mahomes will pick apart standard defenses now hell still probably turn it around this game but it shows how to contain that stacked offense at least for a half
bills a genius
why didnt stidham start the fucking game lol
that ne secondary is locking shit down god damn
these refs i mean wtf are they seeing the dude had his hands on mahomes while trying not to fall himself and gets a flag

then kelsey slips and its pi wow
butker is definitely no justin tucker
this is a weird game for a belichick coached team to be making huge mistakes left and right
hoyer just fd up big time took a sack as time expired going into the 2nd half score is 63 with the chiefs leading patriots could have at least tied it
butler sucks lol

edit auto correct butker
butktner stinks
if the chiefs played like they are tonight against us we win by 20
rip to the patriots hopes this game
anything you see the patriots doing that we can do for future chiefs matchups
the pats have managed to keep mahomes off of the field and drive down the field with freaking brian hoyer for almost the entire 3rd quarter


edit and hoyer screws the patriots again by getting sacked and now losing the ball when they had a chance to at the least tie the game
i love how they keep promoting the falcons vs the packers

nobody is watching that game except their fans not with this game on lol
you guys are watching the wrong game lol only kidding
hoyer may have as many passing yards as lamar did that sucks
the trick to playing mahomes is to slow down the game and if anything we sped it up
romo cursed that kicker lol
well its nice to see patriots fans sad at least
i think i found the loophole to beat the chiefs you need to catch them off guard with a qb that has no or next to no nfl game tape

so obviously the next time the ravens play the chiefs they need to unleash trace mcsorley and announce him as the starter moments before kickoff

seriously though youve got to keep running the football chew the clock and leave kansas citys offense on the sideline easier said than done however even when the chiefs make a mistake they seem unfazed by it and pick things right back up as if nothing happened
fuck the refs
i want the pats defense so bad
mahomes is not as on as he was last week but damn i think we may be overestimating where the ravens are right now theyre not what they were last year not yet at least
its all about coaching harbs is the issue

im pretty sure we also just arent good at scheming our wrs into space
hill works the way he does because this chiefs offense has so many threats you have to worry about and respect equally to the point where gadget plays like the chiefs run with him and hardman are almost impossible to predict are coming
because hes almost always double covered defenses commit a lot more attention to him because we have no other threats except andrews
because the chiefs have so many weapons that can also make big plays if we get behind and roman forgets to run the ball defenses just have to cover mandrews and brown and we got nobody else to make big plays
andy reid x1000 gro
im not even asking for anything that fancy just try to get hollywood on more drags and slants simple stuff
hill reminds me more of a young steve smith sr in terms of playing style fights for the 5050 ball contests deep balls fiery

hollywood cringes and falls down at even a hint of contact im a shameless ravens homer but this team cannot scout draft and develop wrs they just cant and i dont know why hollywood is not looking like a wr1 so far he is undersized but more importantly he plays undersized hill is undersized too but he doesnt play like it
brown isnt hill lamar isnt mahomes
why dont we use brown duvernay the way kc uses hill i know brown isnt hill yet but his speed makes him a threat and they use him in so many different spots for distraction

ftfy
because hes not hill and for that matter the ravens arent the chiefs
because roman doesnt know what he has
because teams can double brown and shut down our entire offense assuming andrews is also focused in on whos gonna be the big threat snead boykin

you double up hill and you leave watkins and hardman 1on1 youre gonna have a bad time
am i the only one who thinks hollywood isnt that fast hill is on another level
brown has magnet hands granted some drops and plays didnt go his way but thats expected hes money i hope he his proud of what he is and has accomplished rock on marble

tucker is so consistent that he is forgotten lol
i said it last week and ill say it again

respect the goat
i remember when greg zurlein was the best kicker then when dan bailey was then when chris boswell was all the meanwhile tucker was better than all of them really says a lot when kickers peak seasons are pretty much on par with tuckers average seasons
third game in a row with a missed kick i wonder what thats like
this game is pissing me off chiefs either crush their opponent or play like shit and get the game handed to them never in between mahomes should have been picked off twice this game and of course the fumble
thinks hes hot shit cuz hes playing for the chiefs
best kicker
if you take a shot at the goat you best not miss
he actually seems below average
the nfls greatest kicker

justin tucker is this your king
butt kicker
chiefs fans need to shut up about him being the best kicker also when did mahomes throw a td i thought they were both rushing tds
tuck doesnt care if the talking heads see him as the best he knows who he is and what he can do thats all that matters let em talk if it makes them feel better
oh and then the dumbass mnf crew was saying there is no one better than mason crosby kicking 40 yards cant remember exact quote i was like do you not remember him missing 5 kicks in one game a couple years ago
he isnt on legatrons level
man fuck tony romo hes god and clarvoiant when he gets something right he needs to be called out when he says dumb shit like this
we dont need a chiefs kicker running commentary
whats the deal with this and what i mean is who cares
yeah i dont know what the hell you guys did to him he was coming right off of the best game hes ever had and then the second we play you guys he turns into a bears kicker
chiefs won another one

judon got all suggs and zadariuss clean up sacks
watching him win one on one pass rushes and get to quarterback is frustrating i dont have confidence that anyone on our team can do that in a consistent basis right now
yeah but he was only soso in his time in baltimore either gb knows how to scheme him better or hes a rare case of an overpaid free agent living up to his contract

but youre not wrong hes become a beast
i think hed be one of my all time favorite ravens if he was still on the team
ravens picked judon over him essentially hindsight is 2020 but would love to have zadarius rn
another sack
as a wft fan i feel the exact same way about preston smith he was decent with us 58 sack a year guy pretty good pressure rates across from kerrigan goes to gb along w zadarius and starts balling tf out obviously i love our ends now but makes you think theres a reason why these guys were decent and both became nice after getting overpaid
im glad we have zadarius smith however

i feel like belichick would like trace mcsorley
rgiii for sure would remember that you dont get 4 timeouts in a half
please no i want robert to have the chance to woo some mofos again but i just really enjoy him as a raven does that make me selfish


view poll
i no longer hate brady i find the bucs fascinating now mahomes and the chiefs are my new hate team
absolutely not flopping is totally subjective knowing how incompetent these refs are this just gives them more ways to ruin the outcome of games

ill pass
as much as i want to say yes subjective calls like that piss all of us off far too often we really dont need to add more subjective calls
that was literally like watching neymar it should definitely be a penalty and carding people for flops in soccer hasnt been a perfect fix but it has helped

also the refs will fuck up no matter what

hate to say it but our loss was worse pats got screwed by the refs with that mahomes interception they also were playing with a back up qb



that being said i really hope wink was taking notes on how the pats absolutely shut down kc for the first half
this game was way closer than what ever the hell we did
qb play hurt the pats the game plan was perfect also the refs blew some calls too
this is wrong but ok
2710 at halftime compared to 63

lets not get ahead of ourselves
is 1 nephew

delete delete delete

we got smacked its fine everyone move on well see them in the playoffs maybe
delete this nephew
it was like 36 going into the 4th right we looked embarrassing the pats at least gave them a run for their money if that interception was called correctly they had a chance to win op is delusional
if you cant beat em be insecure about it lol
yeah no
you still have time to delete this before the morning crowd pours in
comment your score predictions
no predictions but burrow is throwing 300 yards with a terrible o line this is not an easy game on sunday
lamar is gonna come in heated 400 yards of offense from him alone burrow will start hot but start to fall apart in the second half ravens 38 bungles 24
we are going to be shocked that this is going to be a close game burrow is not flustered by blitzes and is accurate as hell he is going to habe a career day against us if bengals didnt have an awfully slow and undisciplined defense i would be extremely worried


i will be downvoted to hell saying this but burrow will be on mahomes level in a few years
ravens 41 bengals 20

the bengals are building something nice their qb is smart and continues to improve i just think the bengals will be overwhelmed just like the texans were

i think our offense will have a big day i also think our dl will take over and smoke their ol
lamar gonna put up 50
bengals fan here its not even going to be a competition lamar is going to run all over us this defense is bad
aj green back lol this should be fun

make burrow escape the pocket the direction you want him toosmack him with queen when he thought he was safe i wish him best of luck but 3 picks and a fumble would be nice
this is gonna be a tough game burrow is really good despite his offensive line sure there defense is trash but we still have to stop there offense also even though aj green has disappeared this season thus far he always shows up to play vs us
we might not like to hear this but the run game is our best defense our actual defense is trash hopefully the run game shows up on sunday if not theyre just going to screen pass us to death

every ravens player each and every person in the organization is extremely valuable rock on you beautiful souls
i mean i still cannot figure out why they have him running the safety blitz on mahomes instead of you know a safety

he learned that spiral from flacco free flacco you cowards i want to see my dude ball out a few more times
taysom hilla poor mans sam koch

have complete the same amount of passes in their carreer taysom making 11 million this year
trace mcsorley better be 2
somehow justin tucker is underrated smh
so i was curious and looked up the stats

tucker inside 50 234 245 9551

crosby inside 50 301 347 8674

also for fun

tucker has had an overall fg above 90 for 5 out of 8 years

crosby has had an overall fg above 90 for 1 out of 13 years last year

i will admit that crosby is apparently better than tucker on fg under 20 hes 99 and tucker has never attempted one in the nfl
packer fan here that was bogus everyone knows that tucker is the goat
i was waiting for the post i will say it took longer than expected
i literally yelled at my husband when the announcer said that and he was like i didnt say it
espn has turned into straight trash every time the announcer spoke they said something dumb they are just another generic cable news network with commentators who say what they are told to say rather than commentate on the game
everyones forgotten jt somehow weird stuff
i guess that means harrison butker is the best 50

x200b

s
i feel like all commentators have to give these outrageous superlatives that are essentially meaningless

i also cant stand when they say as good as anyone else in the league to mean theyre a highly skilled player no if theyre only as good as anyone else theyre just average
i remember crosby missing 5 kicks in one game a few years back
he literally missed an extra point earlier in the game when the announcer said this last i checked an extra point is inside of 50
aw shit here we go again

i remember the first field goal tucker ever missed im pretty sure it was 60 yards in the rainand i was like yup aint even mad
crosby gonna miss a fg and two xps the next two games probably now
crosby is good but you guys have the better kicker
you know these guys are paid for being contrarian right hot takes equal clicks no one who really follows football will say anyone other than jt is the goat its the weather channel syndrome every storm is the best worst until it isnt every kicker is amazing until he is not but who cares because we have tucker
aye let them say others are better it doesnt matter we know bmore knows tucker knows talk that talk league tucker walks that walk easy claps tuck td catch division championship gamefrom koch
the hot takes on kickers this year havent aged well these announcers are absolutely lost
the disrespect this man faces weekly
big tucc no lil tucc
the disrespect to tucker is real
i keep seeing people post this stuff but lets be honest the commentators are paid to comment on that game and the players playing that game they arent really throwing shade at justin tucker they are just trying to complement a kicker that is doing well in the game they are commenting on

edit also people missed the fact that the commenters on the chiefs patriots game talked about how butker has been missing extra points so at least give them credit when they are critical as well
we won but it will get tougher as the season goes on i dont want to brag as its a long season i predict though we will see you in the super bowl you guys might have to buy us tickets we might be watching you guys lol we played great but offense stalled in 2nd half love you raven nation
good shit man you may have gotten dan quinn fired too we miss z
love you bro youre one of the reasons i drafted aaron jones and rodgers on my fantasy teams and they put on heroic performances and carried me for the win looking forward to watching yall after the bye
are you in the rsr board
meh you didnt even let the falcons blow another one wheres the fun in that

s
1 aaron rodgers hes a baaaaaaaaaaaaddddddd man

2 russel wilson mr unlimited

3 patrick mahomes ravens killer

4 josh allen bills mafia messiah

5 action you cant catch me jackson big truzz

let me know your thoughts in case anyone is wondering id probably have dak at 6

wow i just realized this almost matches the nflcom index oops i didnt cheat i swear
patrick kills all no need to single out that charming city
mahomes is the nfl killer aj green is the ravens killer
i think all these players are right and jackson is at 5 rn i can see 12 being swapped and josh allen as high as 2 as well
i was going to quibble with you about dak at 6 but hes got a good case maybe tannehill minshew seems to be cooling off somewhat kyler hasnt taken that leap yet

the old guard of goodnotgreat qbs that youd usually find the 610 range like matt ryan matt stafford kirk cousins and philip rivers have totally cratered and are clearing out room for new faces which is pretty refreshing if you ask me
tied with rodgers is lamar for 1st place
anyone who was calling for harbaugh to be fired is reeeeaaally keeping their mouth shut now lmao
bob was the worst gm man he destroyed that franchise in 2 years as the gm


as a coach he was ok he did take that team to 4 division titles
rumor has it after that 4th and 12 harbaugh was gonna get fired but lamar saved his job the year after
the history of this team is incredible highs lows miracles heartbreak resilient af through it all the ownership and leadership has never broke stronger than steel tougher than tigers more prestigious than a ups box every part of the ravens organization from top to bottom is superior to all others quit your bitching win or lose bmore is where i chose
id have to imagine they considered firing harbs at some point
we have always been a well ran organization just had some bad picks combined with bad luck for a couple years the shit organizations continuously make bad hires overpay signings and draft picks
we were never 04 without our first and second round pick bad though the texans are an embarrassment no way around it
yea i thought it was ridiculous that anyone wanted to let him go i know we had some disappointing seasons leading up to that but the team was just not that talented from 20152017 and harbaugh kept them competitive anyway we had no difference makers on offense besides old steve smith and some of those defenses were weak sauce ozzie gave harbaugh one last gift with our 2018 draft class and that was all he needed to get back to being a perennial playoff contender i did not want us to end up on the jets giants browns coaching carousel
we almost had garrett the clapper remember that

mosley ended up on ir last year after playing just two games and this year he opted out for covid19 reasons

85 million dollars

theres no telling what would have happened if we kept him maybe he would even be playing this year so far it is looking like letting him get overpaid somewhere else was a good idea especially with queen looking good
the jets could trade him after june 1 next season for minimal dead cap him and queen would be an unfair lb duo

x200b

baby come back
well the jets are cursed tho he probably wouldnt have gotten injured here
i think you guys will be prepared more the 2nd time around when you play kc
i like queen he plays as advertised hes faster than mosely and hes pretty good in coverage for a rookie he still has some time before hes great in coverage but for now worth every bit of his draft spot
jets cant even get free of that deal until 2022 at the earliest at least his cap is less next year when the cap drops

afterwards though 18myr is a big yikes
im loving queen so far i would opt out too if i were on the jets lol
its like when you join the jets you get this virus that strips away your health and talent look at leveon bell now its happened to mosley its a shame because ive always considered him a top tier mike
hes a genius took a year off to heal knowing hed come back with a newbetter coaching staff
yeah but queen is turning into mosley

looks exceptionally in the run and his pass protection is sus

i get hes a rookie and coverage is the hardest part so im not shitting on him yet but well see how he progresses
i love mosley but he would let tight ends burn him
well they arent paying him this year so his salary is a moot point
sadly not matching the jets offer was one of the best decision we made in a while but yea if he could come back for the right price that would be a smooth move
we will treat you better come back to mama
i cant upvote this because i love mosely lol

but god damn decosta matrix dodging bullets
it is hard to put the injury and his decision this year as a reason it was wise not to sign him if we resigned him he may never have gotten injured also he might very well have decided to play this year if he was on the ravens think about it if you get a free pass for a year not to play no real questions asked would you want to risk another injury to play for the jets i dont really agree with that kind of decision but i can understand it
not even 2 full games btw
to be fair the jets arent paying him this season anyways
queen is looking nice but if we still had mosely we wouldnt be getting reamed on screens he was legit probably the best in the league at sniffing out screens and getting tackles for a loss or minimum gain
i miss hearing gerry say his name on 98 rocks game broadcasts
highway robbery
sell high buy low
what who wouldnt want to play for the jets
elite dragon bout to match 50 of cjs starts hope flacco can launch a few to perriman like the good old days
cj was a good raven but hes gone now and will stay that way we dodged a bullet not getting suckered into a bidding war with maccagnan hes breaking down and no guarantee hell ever be his old self in with the new
not tagging mosley was probably edcs first real mistake if we had great lb play last year then our defense would have been unfair and maybe we could have worked out a long term deal before the jets could make a ridiculous offer
ok and ilb is a major problem for us right now did anyone predict a player who missed 3 games with baltimore to have a season ending injury followed by opting out of a season because of a pandemic
queen looks good
queen doesnt look good at all
i would like to buy ravens jersey and i wonder what is the difference between this one speed machine from official ravens shop and this one vapor untouchable from nike shop they looks same to me is there any difference
well i dunno why nike has that listed incorrectly upon their own website but those are the exact same style of jersey cut pictured both being speed machine to avoid any confusionmixups i would stick with fanaticsnfl shopfans edgebaltimore ravens shop whenever feasible all operate under the same fanatics umbrella with everything being sent from their outlet located in jacksonville florida especially since they frequently tend to run plenty of various sales

the only time that the ravens utilize the nike vapor untouchable template onfield and therefore also the only versions of said style available to the fans is when they wear the color rush uniform set in fact the vapor untouchable cut was first introduced for all nfl franchises color rush jerseys however most teams have since made the switch full time to the vapor untouchable template for all of their primary alternate jereys

for whatever reason baltimore has not made the changeover from the speed machine style for their primary purple road white alternate black jerseys an additional note from experience if you ever do decide to purchase a color rush jersey which are of course only available via the vapor untouchable template if purchasing limited version that is then i definitely recommend ordering one size up if plausible as they are cut noticeably tightersmaller for a more snug fit than the speed machine versions

the vapor untouchable fabric materials are also sewn together in a much differently constructed manner for instance particularly in person one can immediately recognize the three seams down the back of the jersey including underneath the center of the numerals said seams almost appear to be sort of a modified peace sign or rather like an upsidedown y

x200b

ps just for further clarification the above comparative information is based solely on the limited 150 style since that is what you linked thus presumably where your vested interest currently lies i own two separate color rush versions of lamar jackson game 100 limited 150 the game version is actually sold solely in speed machine style with heatsealed graphics despite being a color rush jersey whereas the limited elite aka authentic styles are hemmedsewnstitched similarly to how they are worn by the players during actual games

in other words when it comes to those two more expensive styles the part about the seams on the back is as i had previously described admittedly i have never bothered with the other two cheaper below game price versions that they deem pro line legend respectively granted i have heard almost nothing besides negative reviews regarding legend style such as that it is essentially an overpriced tshirt version of a jersey but simply presented as a notaspricey alternative option to the others i hope all of this has been helpful for your considerations
sorry had to fish this out of the spam filter

3 sacks 4 tfls 5 qb hurries 8 tkls for z vs atl i cant thank you guys enough he changed our pass rush
we definitely picked the wrong dude hes so good lmao

i still think judon can get hot though i feel like he has waves of really good play hopefully it comes at the most crucial time
z smith was a situational pass rusher and never was a starter and historically when guys like him leave they never live up to their contracts but he really proved he is the real deal we could use a guy like him hindsight is 2020 though
what a beautiful message that was a touching moment last night
wont be shocked if packers make it to the nfc championship game again
its like watching jimmy butler do his thing on the heat as a sixers fan lmao all i know is pain
love that dude i wish we had the wherewithal to keep him here but im glad he plays for the packers instead
glad to see this man ballin that said no fans saw him doing this cant blame edc for not keeping him hes the first person weve let go that i can remember taking a major step forward love watching him play in gb and if he had the production with us in 18 he did in 19 guarantee we keep him
next to my ravens license tag plate holder thingy

i forgot to take a picture

need a car wash

that is all

steelers suck
at the garage i park there was a car that had a steelers plate and bumper stickers i had a bunch of the promotional ravens car magnets for about six months i would put one of the magnets on the back of the car about every two or three weeks
instant death

i feel bad for sam darnold he has to watch lamar allen and baker play for teams who work with their strengths and weaknesses while his teams whole strategy is pretty much just fuck you throw the ball to this new trio of scrubs
joe cool has entered the chat
vegas just fixed jets superbowl odds
im fully on board for the chaos that would ensue if flacco plays well and they are forced to make a decision
i hope he does well
flacco vs lamar afc championship game book it

we all watching the jets on sunday then lads
january joe is back

2013


its out there on social media but i couldnt find it again it did say it was his fastest run of his career though

most accurate kicker and most accurate qb of all time in one photo
this is the embodiment of perfection there is no other belee dat
i wonder if this is the longest a long snapper punter and kicker combination have played together

additionally while their respective development production consistent contributions rapidly continue along with some eventually established tenure devin duvernay james proche ii will likely become considered major pieces of the whole specialteamsstandouts conversation

also i love that the latter chose 11 which seems fitting since it looks like the numerals at the end of his name plus proche already appears to be washing the bad taste out of our mouths left by breshad perrimans play in said digits thus far james must be makin kamar aiken proud
2 things
koch is jacked for a punter
morgan cox is a huge part of tucks success long snappers get no glory but are critical to jtucks rhythm
morgan cox is a graduate of my alma mater the university of tennessee go vols

love the wolf pack i named my dog tucker best special teams unit in the league
i see the wolfpack i upvote
you can call this the new world order of special teams brother
morgan cox has is just yanda post weight loss
sicko mode or mo bamba
koch look like he could turn defenders into minced meat
da goats
dont turn your back on the wolfpack you might wind up in a body bag
dont forget the practice squad long snapper nick moore who can for some fucking reason punt leftfooted
schedule is still wrong dudes
wonder how stover compares to tucker
next on undisputed
koch has a high completion percentage so yes i would say this should be considered
is tucker threatening to take hollywoods job
skkkkiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuuuupppp
hell be above trace and rg3 next week on the depth chart
i meankoch is the most accurate qb in nfl history on 4th down
only on fourth down
clearly
people seem split on doom and gloom this team is horrible or were the best team ever stop trying to coach from your couch the bottom line is were an extremely talented team that hasnt seemed to click on all cylinders yet and were 31 with 3 blowout wins we were embarrassed and humbled by one of the greatest offenses in nfl history it happens lets go through the positions

quarterback b

so far lamar has had a great game a good game a pretty ok game and a bad game its definitely not entirely his fault but well get into the other positions later for some reason maybe its harbaugh or gro or maybe lamar himself but it almost looks like hes containing himself to the pocket unnecessarily i can think of two reasons for this one were trying to prove that lamar can be an amazing passer if this is the reason it needs to stop we know lamar can throw but the more he does with his legs the more dangerous he becomes with his arm two in a season with a limited training camp injuries are popping up like daisies so were playing to protect him i dont think this is the case as lamar is very good at avoiding bad hits but either way we need to unleash the beast also once he starts hooking up more consistently with hollywood on the deep balls it will open up a lot for this offense its just a matter of time

runningbacks b

the running backs have been solid but asides from the houston game not amazing the main thing bothering me is the scheming and playcalling which obviously isnt their fault we have a loaded backfield why arent we using it to its full potential i dont even mean the we need to just run the ball more narrative running back is a position you need to get hot and we sub so much that it makes it difficult to do so why not run a 2 rb set with ingram and dobbins the possibilities are endless and you have two of our best players on the field the golden rule of offense is get the ball in your playmakers hands we cant do that if theyre on the sideline like seriously think of everything we could do with that set its crazy

wide receivers c

hollywood is the bright spot here he runs good routes finds open space and is reliable him and lamar are just a tick off but im not worried about that boykin does not run good routes he does not play to his size hes an amazing run blocker but thats a secondary concern for wide receivers we need players to reliably get open to move the chains and help when were down multiple scores id like to see more duvernay out there with hollywood speed kills just watch kansas city i like snead but he doesnt get the ball too often we desperately need a true possession wr1

tight end a

probably a higher grade than deserved at this point but at the end of the day andrews had a bad game hes still a great tight end and lamars go tothough hollywood is sneaking in there boyle is underrated its a good group i miss the 3 te sets but i still think it was a good trade as long as dobbins is actually used to his full potential

o line c

yanda is missed though i did see improvement last game in their defense kc knew we were passing most of the game which leaves clark to focus on blitzing every down once they get more playtime together and are healthy this grade should go up

dline b

i think this is another case of just needing more playtime together to be able to generate more pressure the starters are all also on the wrong side of 30 after cleveland the run defense has been top tier

cornerback a

losing tavon stings especially if you look at his contract but it doesnt matter they still get a marlon is the best in the league change my mind peters has also been incrediblebesides maybe that kc game averett has honestly been a pleasant surprise so far one of these years tavon will stay healthy and this secondary will be god tier

inside lb b

fort has been very strong not much to report here queen is playing like a talented rookie he makes mistakes but he generally does more good than harm pass coverage will get better he didnt have a full training camp or any preseason to work with and nfl speed is much higher than ncaa harrison is also pretty much playing the par for what i expected he bites and gets fooled easily im ignoring the kc game for both of them as thats not fair at all at this point in their career board sucks tho

outside lb c

judon is overpaid but also the scheming has been kind of weird i think wink sometimes outsmarts himself against kc judon was covering wide receivers i get being creative and trying to fool a good offense but sometimes you just have to rush your best rusher and hope he makes plays with that said im open to a judon trade as he only seems to get to the qb if hes untouched i want to see more ferguson bowser seems to be getting to the pocket but cant finish mcphee has been relatively quiet let sack daddy in

safety b

not necessarily bad but nothing great here either deshon is basically a rookie with the amount of playtime he has clark has been solidthe ff against the chiefs was great but id like to see more

wolfpack god tier

no words i can think of are worthy of the wolfpack

tldr

i think some adjustments to scheming on both offense and defense would help a lot but were still 31 the amount of raw talent on this team is ridiculous which gives us a chance every game or allows us to blow opponents up even when we dont look great
i just felt deflated after being beaten by the chiefs again
the staff needs to realize that edwards in the answer at rb he runs like zeke elliot and we shouldnt dump to the rb anyways or should i say it feels like we rarely do if gus can get 6 ypc let him eat
kicker a
i dont know about lamar and the dline having the same grade
i dont know anyone that is talking about doom and gloom i think people are rightfully critical of the overall performance and pointing out how it wont be enough to win a sb which has been the constantly talked about goal for the ravens by the ravens for the past 2 years

quaterback b

it is the defenses that are containing lamar in the pocket they have been spying the outside and trying to keep him in the pocket you can notice when he does get out to scramble there are almost always guys on the outside waiting for him when watching a number of those games and plays he is actually better off stepping up into the pocket so that is an adjustment he is making his passing is a bit better this year even on the passes that seem to be off if you watch a number of those are placed precisely so the defense cant make a play on the ball but it also unfortunately makes it a difficult catch for the wr defenses are watching the sides to contain lamar and getting into passing lanes to prevent big plays the ravens havent done a good job of changing their scheme to take advantage more of zone defense lamar also needs to do a better job of taking what the defenses are giving rather than trying to make the big play all the time he also had this issue last year but at least the ravens had a much more powerful rush attack to rely on

running backs b

you are right on the scheme but not necessarily the answer the ravens switched up from their scheme last year of loading up with tes and trying to go to more wide sets they are trying to evolve the pb to include more passing specifically to help address the problem of falling behind in games they dont have the same heavy blocking personnel they had last year so the run game has definitely taken a hit the point of bringing in a fresh guy like dobbins was to try and utilize a bit more flexibility and elusiveness rather than straight raw power mainly because they knew they werent going to have the same blocking capability the running game is actually third in the league and averaging 54 ypc why arent they using them more

ultimately i think the ravens just havent been running enough i feel this is a consistent problem for the ravens where they try to out coach other teams rather than just playing their own game i mean why didnt they run more against the chiefs it just doesnt make sense some of the decisions they try to make the chiefs were soft in the middle of the dline almost all game specifically because they were on a mission to contain lamar

wide receivers

i think you are slightly too critical on boykin i have actually seen him get open a number of times but he wasnt the target on the play they have used him mainly for blocking and quick short throws he is more of a deep threat but hasnt been used as much for that he is already close to his targets and receptions from last year it seems this year more teams are clued in on who the ravens targets are on plays the chiefs especially had their number and almost knew what the ravens were doing before they even called the play i agree that a true possession receiver would be good but that is mainly what andrews and snead are supposed to be in this offense

also it seems the ravens are starting to move toward quicker passes and i think they are going to be using duvernay more to try and take a bit more pressure off of lamar and the run game part of this i believe is also lamars fault with consistently trying to push the ball downfield instead of taking what the defense gives part of this is what we love about him when we see beautiful passes to brown or andrews but is also what other teams are cluing on when they contain him in the backfield

overall it is hard to grade the wr group i am not convinced the issue is purely the receivers i think a lot has to do with scheme and a bit with lamar trying to hard for big plays

tight end c

here i think you are being generous i wouldnt grade the te group that highly i also think this is a case where the ravens decided to only keep 2 known solid quantities and are suffering because of it their 3 te sets last year were a huge part of the success of the offense and we are seriously missing that advantage this year andrews has had a few issues this year with some drops at crucial moments overall i think this also comes down to scheme and how they are using the tes this year just another note but andrews has very similar stats tohayden hurst who we traded away

oline b

agree pretty much with this although i would give them a slightly higher grade i think they are solid but clearly not the same dominant unit as last year also we arent using the tes quite as much to help bolster the blocking also many times lamar is getting stopped in the backfield specifically because he is scrambling out of a mostly clean pocket he isnt doing his oline favors when he does that last year we had more flexibility because there was more experience on the oline and more tes to help out this year teams are focusing on the outside waiting for lamar to scramble out

dline c

i mean there is no easy way to say this but our dline is not playing to their potential we are asking far too much of calais out there and he is playing well but at his age he shouldnt be asked to cover so much of the field while the rush defense is doing pretty well the dline isnt getting enough pressure in the passing game

ilb b

fort has played well situationally and queen has been getting a lot of tackles but that hasnt been keeping teams off the field what isnt being done is making enough plays in the passing game there is a severe problem with lbs in their coverage this year and that is mainly due to inexperience

olb d

i am tempted to give this an f there is no easy way to say this but the olbs have been terrible they arent getting pressure fast enough and they arent containing the outside well enough they are consistently getting fooled with screens and quick passes which are gashing our defense to death they are telegraphing everything they do its just badall bad i dont really have anything good to say about the olbs right now

cb b

i mean you cant really give the cbs an a when the ravens have one of the worst passing defense in the league i think you are giving them way too much credit based on reputation alone i dont really think the coverage problems are the fault of the cbs but i just cant grade them higher when they are a bottom 10 passing defense humphrey is really good but peters hasnt been as good this year a lot of this has to do with needing to cover up for the olbs and the safeties but the cbs need to shoulder some of the blame here as well

safety c

i dont know what can really be said about the safeties there was so much hype for elliott starting and for chuck clark after last season but they just havent been living up to the hype bottom 10 pass defense a lot of that rests on the shoulders of the safeties chuck has been solid but elliott has been a liability especially in coverage this is the reason we are seeing more of jimmy at the safety spot elliott is just not performing up to expectations

i mean lets be honest the ravens defense has not been as dominant as they were billed to be this year you cant call yourself a dominant defense and be bottom 10 in pass defense in this league the coverage and play recognition has not been good for this defense and it is going to be more and more evident when we play pass heavy teams
im deeply concerned concerned about our pass rush

im mildly concerned about our running game
not excited about the team this year we need to prove that we can win from behind and not completely fall apart in the games that matter most before i can feel good about them again
i think the run game grade is a little generous it still needs a little love this season in comparison to some other teams effectively running the ball for chunk gains especially if you take lamar out of the equation
disagree about our receivers i think theyre better than you think guys are getting open but lamar was super flustered in that chiefs game his worst game as a pro by far other than that our pass game has been very very good on a per attempt basis also disagree hard about one of your points about lamar his passing from outside the pocket has been significantly better than it was last year which is exciting the first td throw to andrews on sunday was more impressive than any throw on the run he has made in his career to date

i dont see a huge point in ranking our position groups this is a great football team i still think were the second best team in the league but were inarguably top 5 last year was always going to be impossible to replicate the ravens were the best team in the league in the regular season by a mile not necessarily one of the best in nfl history but we were the type of dominant team that comes along 34 times per decade expecting something similar this season was not realistic

look at where we were after week 4 last year 22 with hints of locker room drama coming off an absolute shellacking by a divisional rival at home this year we have been smoked once but we got smoked by the superprepared defending super bowl champions that played their absolute agame

im slightly concerned about the pass rush i dont think its solvable with a clay matthews or ziggy ansah signing because those guys arent better than what we have theyre probably about the same though i would be open to bringing one in if someone gets hurt and decosta wont mortgage our future to trade for a melvin ingram were going to have to keep creating pressure with numbers and scheme and trusting our secondary but its definitely concerning that we struggled to create pressure against kc even though we kept blitzing

i think the biggest problem is just that if the chiefs stay healthy and play their a game its going to be very very difficult to beat them well have to play our a game and have a few bounces go our way to pull that one out might need one of those calais tipped balls to turn into an interception and keep up the special teams dominance while were at it

ultimately this team is good enough to win the super bowl am i as high on the ravens as i was after we beat sf last year or after we laid waste to the rams on mnf no but im higher on them than i was at the same time last year and i have faith that this team is wellcoached and highcharacter and will continue to get better all season and i have faith that decosta will bring in a helpful piece for cheap at the trade deadline its tough to get excited about games against the wft and cincinnati but theres certainly a very interesting stretch after the bye well know a lot more then
no one is saying the team is horrible only the pass rush and pass protection are

judon sucks as does bowser ferguson and ward is an okay de

our dl can generate interior pressure but that just pushed them to the outside where our edge rushers cant play contain guard the flat or defend a screen to save their lives

it doesnt help we have a young and inexperienced ilb this is a growing pain for queen

as for rg phillips is most likely a backup quality he has no leverage or push and seems to be slow to the 2nd level our pp is poo poo

idk how you can give our olbs a c theyre a flat f

we blitz a ton matt judon never wins 1on1s and this has been apparent for years

wrs would be better if they had more time for their routes we cant keep protection before lamar has to scramble


god i hope we put investment into olineman in the draft if were losing stanley a year after yanda gonna hurt oline is already kind of hobbled
you mean future jet ronnie stanley
man this always worried me i value ol and dl a lot more than most people

that being said 24myear for stanley i love the dude but we got major issues at pass rush and ol

it might again be 8020 with a franchise tagged year before we say good bye
cant help but think the ravens were sending a subtle message to stanley when they had brown play lt on sunday especially when you consider how well he performed and harbaughs comments after the game
i mean we can also get an absolutely insane haul for stanley imo save money get picks and pick up a fa wr or edge all hope is not lost if he is gone
i saw this coming and honestly im okay with it locking up that much cap in a lt is just not going to work regardless of how good they are
everyone is replaceable its not like well play with 4 olinemen if stanley walks and its not like the money we would have paid him gets thrown away well sign other quality players if this happens
i dont understand the idea that having a bad oline with lamar is okay because lamar is so athletic he can mask a bad oline any qb even lamar under constant pressure is not good it leads to mistakes it leads to lamar getting tired and it leads to him getting hit more sacrificing oline because lamar is elusive is not something that should be done help him as much as possible last year the oline was excellent and he threw for 36 touchdowns this year he cant hit on long shots and it under pressure way more often and it shows
i mean this is concerning hes one of the best lts in the game
orlando was a lt throughout college
would love to get a tunsil like haul for stanley and look to the draft
if decosta and harbs think its the right move than i will support it hopefully the return is sizeable since he was a 6th overall pick who has been playing like it since he entered the league especially last year
hes the guy to franchise tag i think good move for judon this past offseason who we now know isnt worth the money he wants who else would be a better contender in that regard
its a good idea to let stanley walk if he is commanding 22 reinvest the 22 in other parts of the line and draft a tackle high
does anyone remember 2013 does anyone want a repeat of 2013
if we do trade himid hate that move we better get a fuck ton of draft capital but bob was the one making the trade for tunsil so idek what wed get for him if the dolphins were able to get 2 1sts and a 2nd for tunsil we better get a bit more for stanley
everyone complains about the offense and then wants to let a top 3 tackle walk just pay the man
fuck bill obrien for overpaying tunsil
draft a tackle 1st round after he leaves and will probably be ok still would like to see a deal made but not for tunsil money
devils advocate lamars escapability really made all of our olinemen better than what they really were

imagine the haul we would get for stanley plus the cap savings we could get a top end defensive player with the free space and possibly multiple 1sts im in
i dont know but we need to at least have him for another year by tagging him then let him go if we cant reach a long term deal i say 20m a year is fair for stanley
i agree jeff
bill o brien didnt just fuck the texans he fucked the league on the lt market
somebody we like wont get a new deal jackson is the only sure thing i can see all other options are on the table
trade him than for two draft picks than
tunsil had unique leverage cause the texans gave away their draft future to get him and also cause bob was a moron
we should definitely keep him depending on his injuries this year i mean he is a staple of our whole offense a good qb dont mean shit if the oline is horrendous
if we have to let him walk then thats really unfortunate but orlando brown has played really well at lt in his absence id imagine well still at very least franchise him for a year though
if be more ok with losing him if the rest if the oline werent awful
thats why we played obj at left tackle to test how we would look without stanley

give the ball to gus edwards 20 times a game
the team is 11th in offensive dvoa this year obviously not annihilating opponents like last year but its also not 25th
the ravens are currently 11th in offensive dvoa the cowboys rank 1st in yards but are 12th in offensive dvoa
well we havent really played 3 out of 4 fourth quarters this season and we spend most games after the 2nd half just burning clock it feels like

x200b

also weve played some pretty bad offenses which means their drives end early and give us good field position which prevents us from racking up large yardage numbers etc
scoring more points
eh yards per game is a garbage metric not saying the offense couldnt stand to improve but were far from the 25th offense

edit last year we were 27th in passing yards per game just for reference
hard to rack up offensive yards when marlon keeps forcing fumbles at the opponents 30
25th thats fucking pathetic
play more than 4 games in a 16 game schedule plus we had 3 comfortable wins with lamar sitting early in 2 of them the only game our offense just died was kc
what about in points per game
if we had yanda this wouldnt be a conversation
but hey ill take being 31 and up next the bengals
so now that we got our 4 warmups out the way its on
get rid of gro
im day dreaming about having the money to blow on a jersey and just looking st prices some are 79 99 and 149 are there quality differences that i should be aware of im not entirely sure what the difference is in the products or why they would be charged to so dramatically higher on the high end scale

ive never owned a jersey because poverty but i really want one one day obviously the 79 seems like the best deal but would it get fucked up in a washing machine while another one is better for actually cleaning

and info on the quality difference between jerseys if there is one would be nice
if youre on nflshop or fanatics or the ravens store click on details and bring the drop down on the specific jersey the 149 are vapor so theyre stitched the cheaper you get the less stuff that will be stitched on the cheapest level of jerseys wont have stitched on numbers and itll all be just screen printed like on them


also for future reference i always make sure to wear a shirt under my jerseys and rarely wash any of them stitched or not but if i do i was them alone on delicate or by hand and definitely do not throw them in the dryer

probably not hes not very good

at this point in his career he is similar to boykin probably runs better routes but age is catching up to him 49ers are young at wr but they need the help still and the 9ers still cut him
nah this is a flacco era move
to add my perspective i say if hes available on waivers or for next to nothing then get him otherwise not a big enough improvement over what we have to give anything away
thats his second time getting cut in 2 months why would we want him he isnt going to draw any more attention from a defense than boykin does and atleast boykin knows the offense
actually he could hurt he wasnt even that productive with tom brady last year and brady had awful receivers

id much rather continue to give boykin or duvernay a shot than pick up another aging veteran wr who just wastes a roster spot
we are the kings of drafting old receivers in the twilight of their career crabtree maclin to some extent steve smith and mike wallace for once i want us to have the good new blood or the ones who get a real superstar like hopkins aside from cap space and all of the logistics of it
source the 49ers are releasing wr mohamed sanu as sf gets healthy at the position with some of their young guys rare for an experienced accomplished wr to be free in early october

sure but we need line help
no thx
nah not interested in sanu im fully convinced we need to focus on filling in the rg position with someone suitable to be called a yanda replacement our oline is what is causing problems and its because that area is weak

our receivers are fine we need someone who can help prevent the line from crumbling immediately
we need a wr 1 if were going to upgrade the position not sanu ik the earl stuff happened and we dont want those kind of guys but it was clear the players didnt want him here theyve also made it clear they wouldnt mind ab so neither would i

did judon do this himself i wouldnt put it past him
did someone do this because he was our highest graded pass rusher so far this year lol
body by taco bell
been eating a bit more taco bell

i havent had much issue with averett this season yes hes a downgrade from tavon but overall hes been decent enough certainly the weak link in our secondary but not some huge liability that we must address asap

however i dont know who this dorsey fool was that we threw in the game in the 4th quarter to get burned by scarence terrence so im all for bringing carr back so we dont have to see him again

plus carr is an awesome locker room and community guy so just for selfish reasons id love for him to be back with the organization
might as well kick the tires on him cant be worse than aevrett in the slot and can play safety to keep jimmy more on cb

still need olbs more than anything
anyone watch him on dallas

i always liked him and thought he was great for db depth always had some big plays when we needed it i think we should sign him with tavon gone
one more injury in the secondary from being in trouble carr can play safety too def think its worth it
id like to see him back he provides great depth
carr averett play jimmy at cb
whatever it takes to get averett of the field
if the cowboys cut him he must be done
oh no carr is an awesome human being i wish him the very best in life
did the cowboys kill his games started streak if they did i will never forgive them
im all for brandor
yes plz
no


can you not spam your personal website everywhere
no deliberation needed he sucks so if someone offers anything we should trade him but his value is the opposing sky high its more like septic tank low hes gonna ask for an unwarranted contract and this year his cap hit is already 17 million or so no one wants that it isnt even close to a risk definitely more of a help if we trade judon now

for what its worth pff grades
murray 466
queen 293

it should be noted that queens low grade is heavily due to him getting torched in coverage kc his rush d and pass rush d rating are both much better than murray
i am glad we took queen because i believe he will be the better lb in the end but it is hard to say that right now when queen is so bad in coverage which was one of the main things he was supposed to help upgrade
i was having this conversation last night lol

he gelled with our defense almost immediately and hes putting up better numbers than murray
why are you going to offer some side by side analysis
im sure guy looked at number of tackles and made his brilliant observation
i feel the jury is still out murray we wont know until he gets an expanded role
as a chiefs fan wish we would have got him
neither stand out queen is a flat out liability in coverage and still struggles against o linemen didnt like him before the draft and i dont like him now

he was super close to having another one too he punched a ball out later in the game it somehow bounced around in the players hands and wound up right back in his grasp
the truly insane thing is that typically youre trained to wrap and tackle and that trying to force a fumble and tackle at the same time usually turns into a broken tackle you wrap and let guy 2 go for the ball


ol hump out here just routinely tackling while attacking the ball and forcing fumbles consistently all by himself wtf
hes the new charles tillman hes just trying to revive the famous peanut punch

they do need a rb and we need an edge rusher cmon edc make it happen
personally i feel that gus and dobbins are gonna be our 2 main backs next year
unless edc can literally hypnotize people the chargers would never go for this
why do they need an rb eckler is likely only out for a month and kelley looks pretty promising theres not enough in this trade for them
probably not enough film on edwards to demand much value maybe if we would have actually used him during the titans loss
i could see m ingram doing great in purple
gus edwards isnt worth much in a trade he is a 3rd string power back with 0 receiving skills and who is a rfa at the end of the season undrafted guys and late round guys are performing well enough in the league for teams to not value these guys much plus im sure we will give him a 23 year contract instead of the rfa tender at the end of the season and roll with jk and him
the chargers arent dumb enough to do this not unless bob gets hired as a shadow gm for some fucked reason
i saw a comment on the chargers subreddit that said all gordon is good for is taking carries away from your other backs
fuck that what a dumb trade suggestion gus is our best back

why is the general consensus from most fans outside of reddit too that gus isnt our best back

its glaringly obvious how well his power run style fits our team hill and ingram are out after this season


id trade a 2nd judon and a 6th for ingram and a 3rd
nope give me gus and his contract over ingrams any day big names are nice but we are cash poor
im glad none of us armchair gms are actual gms i know id be pretty terrible at it probably the worst of alltime

with that said id try hard not to go over 22 million per year but would go up to 24 million if it was the only way id rather pay a premium than deal with the headache of losing the best left tackle in the nfl whos only 26 it may also be beneficial to consider franchise tagging him to give him 2 more years to prove hes the best in the league

while i think some people have a point in saying the return would be huge if they were to trade him id have to disagree and say hitting on a top draft pick like him at lt is too valuable to give up in his prime

view poll
he was the best tackle in football last year and is graded again as the top tackle currently this year you dont get rid of franchise lt you pay the man what he wants
theres teams that desperately need a tackle and we have one of the best we didnt look great but it wasnt horrible without him we could trade him for pretty much anything we want i know this is going to be an unpopular opinion but if we can fix a couple of our weaker positions while avoiding draining our cap ready for the downvotes
spotrac who do a pretty solid job of estimating market value has him valued at

4yrs 67m 16mil per yer
i think if any team comes talking multiple firsts for him he has to go with the way we draft that is giving us gold and buying us more time to lock up other talents

i think barring that he doesnt get tunsil money because tunsil clearly got overpaid especially for what they are getting out of him now but anything shy of that is worthy something closer to 1820 is realistically where he should land i think
i hope we franchise him for a year or two to give time for another team to reset the market that bob fucked up with the tunsil deal hopefully someone can push the rate down to the 1820m ballpark
houston may have overpaid for tunsil but we should not overpay for stanley draft one and yes we need 2 edge rushers judon gone after the season
trade for 2 firsts draft pass rushers

and use the money to buy a cheaper rt and switch orlando to lt cut judon and go for a prime receiver or another pass rusher
id sit stanley down and explain his current market value hes not landing anywhere for 17 on a 75 guarantee if he keeps getting injured and hes not an elite tier lineman aloneweve seen him without skura and yanda he doesnt elevate the line around him id be looking for a trade but if hed agree to 16 or less guaranteed id roll the dice

ravens is clearly the best choice but baltimore mustangs does sound cool but the colts left dont bother referencing them
i was one of those who suggested ravens it was a perfect fit for baltimore considering edgar allen poe lived and died there
why were the americans even an option jfc lmao

they all pretty much sucked though ravens was a great choice
i never liked any of the other options thats why 9 year old me called the sun to vote ravens who knows how many times
bombers
by far the rest sucked
for me ravens was a no brainer based on the significance
the rest were just bad perhaps by design
americans is an even dumber name than texans

if any team should be named that its washington not a maryland team tf plus it sounds corny af
imagine how thematically appropriate a steelers vs railers game would be
mustangs would be the closest lol
i think ravens was by far the best choice but if it had to be something else i think the baltimore bombers could have been cool
i was hoping for the baltimore huns we could have had some sort of attila character as a mascot and the cheerleaders would all have worn beehive wigs
bacteria haha
my highschool team was the mustangs and we sucked so ill never like it mauraders sounds pretty cool though
the railers just because of the double meaning

will this be released as a hardback version
is your flacco one a nike or reebok jersey
so i bought 2 jerseys i have a fanatics proline replica and a nike color rush replica im a big guy and i can tell you the proline though not by much fits a bit tighter

marks got it i see a future for him in sports media
removed
i was ufilmstudys guest last night on the offensive review of the wft game and i wanted to continue the dialogue we had about fluker do you think hed best serve as our rg instead of a backup tackle in case of injury given phillips rookie growing pains and what we saw from fluker against a good defensive line i do feel like we are handicapping ourselves a bit in the name of depth
i believe the ravens will stand pat with phillips at right guard even if that means more growing pains throughout the season baltimore elected to go with the midround rookie over the veteran fluker and secondyear ben powers who got the start in last years season finale and performed pretty well in a year without any preseason games and a shorter camp that already is a pretty tall feat all things considered

now i get that dj fluker is the more consistent talent right now but i can see why the ravens want to stick with tyre phillips for one hes the future whereas fluker is only signed for a year i think and benching phillips all of a sudden is probably not the best thing to do in the long run in terms of his confidence secondly his potential can only be realized with more experience it may take the majority of the season to see it but if it does happen it will pay dividends down the stretch and postseason for the ravens as well in the years to come

unless phillips gets hurt or he doesnt show any improvement before the bye week i just cant see the ravens making the swap lets put it this way if the ravens didnt see the potential in phillips would they have gone with him over players that actually have nfl experience in a possible super bowl year it just so happens that fluker is still a pretty good player and there isnt anywhere for him to start on the line so hes there as great depth for whenever a guard or tackle goes down and he needs to step in like he did this past weekend
orlando brown jr didnt get the start over hurst until like week 5 harbs doesnt like playing rookies

phillips got the start over a solid vet in fluker and 2nd year bredson with like zero offseason and literally zero preseason games

that says everything about their evaluations imma stick with what they are seeing
my biggest problem right now is i see philips drifting back into spots that are cutting off running lanes for lamar he cant get forward out of the pocket hes having to loop around making him susceptible to the outside pressure thats usually getting moved towards the back of the pocket by the guards he is essentially getting bottled up by his own lineman and there have been multiple drives that went stale this year so far because lamar couldnt take his first out because he ran into philips

also the whole line will benefit more from sticking to the run theres some big guys we are asking to pass defense for along time and theyre not always holding up
in terms of replacements for the young linementhe process of developing a young lineman and assimilating them to nfl play is always a slow one that takes patience as a major ingredient literally every ol the ravens have drafted didnt play as well as a rookie as he would eventually even ogden and stanley improved plenty during year 1 and into year 2 but the other successful olmen who got their start in baltimore since 2006 have all had upward trajectories which lasted 4 weeks to 3 years jason brown chester yanda grubbs gaither hurst osemele jensen wagner skura stanley eluemunor bozeman objr all improved during their rookie seasons and beyond most of them started in the cd grading level by my system for at least part of their rookie seasons


the exceptions to the rule are john urschel mind elsewhereregressed then gave up football michael oher ski slope career after fine rookie year at rt and i dont care whether you want to blame the ravens for moving him and alex lewis injuries ended up playing his best as a rookie


all this is to say giving up on phillips is premature bozeman was in almost exactly the same point last year before he saved his job in seattle with a good game and has been good since

hoping our afc brothers go to 41 this week
yall some major simps for going in therr and harping on every area that the ravens arent perfect at of course the team has weaknesses no perfect team can exist in the salary cap era

we have a top 3 roster in the afc top 5 team at worst meanwhile the bengals are struggling to be a top 20 team and have a terrible defense and ol

you guys really dont want to just say that this game is another creampuff easy blowout game because of that one titans are hoes post which means we cant recognize this game for what it is right

before the texans and wft game everyone pretty much knew the games were going to be blowouts in the ravens favor with a very slim chance of an upset its the same thing with the bengals theyre going to lose by like 30 and any other outcome would be a shock

i miss him too but i wouldnt miss that contract 17m cap hit this year and 20m next year
literally just made a post on him lol think we should of kept him
people saying he wasnt that good on the ravens really dont understand how insanely effective he was in a limited role during his last season with us he didnt just magically get good with gb theres a reason the packers spent all that money on him
zadarius smith has been named nfc defensive player of the week after his 3sack performance on monday night football

i didnt think hed be this good however i did want to keep him seeing how other guys who left turned out i thought maybe we made the right decision once i saw the money i knew he was gone im glad hes playing well i just wish we couldve worked something out
zadarius on the ravens was nothing like zadarius on the packers he had trouble getting pressures setting the edge and pretty much had lost his starting job to judon
rravens 2018 we dont need him hes not that good at getting pressure our system makes him look good

rravens 2020 we need to trade our allpro elite lt for an edge rusher or anyone that can get sacks

rravens 2021 our ol sucks lj8 is getting creamed on the left side why didnt we draft a lt in the first round

watt would be amazing but its hard to imagine us giving up a 1st for him 3x dpoy future hof merits a 1st

idk why nobody is talking about michael gallup dude is more wellrounded than any wr on our roster has a year left on his rookie deal and is forgotten behind cooper lamb over in dallas

pass rush is the bigger need but who thought we needed a cb before we got peters if were going to pass a lot then lamar needs better wrs end of story
safe bet judon is out
not that i wouldnt love watt but we need edge guys and idk if watt can play edge
pass rush plz god
low key i think a fs might be on the radar as well ravens covet a good fs reed weddle and then earl maybe the vikings would be willing to part with harrison smith he has two years left on his deal

other options i could see are whitney mercilus trent murphy ryan kerrigan and michael gallup all are positions of need and would provide a small boost
obviously this is just an opinion piece really so who knows what might happen but who do we think theyre looking at or even what positions
am i the only one that doesnt want watt just massive injury concerns for me over 30 expensive really wish we would have got yannick
if you get bosa you might be able to beat mahomes if roman grounds and pounds all game like the ravens can do
marvin jones det and kenny stills hou are two i can think of
wait until tiktok hears about us trading lamar for 7 1st rounders
music to my ears trades will be nedded for a super bowl run
gr has been dreaming up a new system centered 2 x running qbs we trade for watson for the quintuple option back attack
tony jefferson anybody at pass rush those 2 are my hopeful positions at least
i wouldnt mind jj watt itll be extra motivation facing his brother twice a year thatll be awesome
is the tank back on in jacksonville would they be willing to part with josh allen

funny but

i know you did not just crosspost the steelers
ive never seen it before but now i cant unsee it
lets go brownies

heinz field 2018
okay i give up someone help me see it
it took a minute
fuck the browns and fuck the steelers by the way
cant unsee
at least hes wearing a mask
funny that the steelers subreddit did this considering their fans recent chants during a certain game with playoff implications
ha
ravens fans steelers fans

fuck yall tho
ill never see it any other way now

laugh at the browns
fuck the steelers

id love to see him do well hes a good guy i would not bet on it tho
oh shit jets just became superbowl contenders
flacco dueling lamar jackson in the 2020 playoffs colorized
go joe hope he can make that comeback i miss him but i dont miss him
its crazy to think that perriman and flacco could be a thing again
looks like i gotta watch both raven games now
will be the worst receiving core hes ever worked withwhich is saying a lot
100 rooting for the jets this weekend
new york joes
pack it up guys were fucked
waaaahhnnnn aaaayyyyytttteeeeeeeeeee
congrats big joe love to see it
hell be the second joe ever to start a game for the jets

edit at qb
the 124 jets will be my favorite storyline this nfl season
elite dragons always rise to the top
the return of the dragon the joe flacco story
thats my qb
league fucked
release the kraken er dragon

go joe go hope your ol can protect you so you can use your cannon arm
new york ravens baby
over under 25 rushing yards for flacco
leveon bell is about to get 15 catches for 25 yards lol
if they can sneak into the playoffs watch out playoff joe cool comes alive
rip cardinals
people are going to want to shit on his checkdown last week but when youre 3rd and 30 checking down to play the field position game isnt a bad move
keep getting them checks joe
im nervous for him since their oline is complete garbage hopefully he doesnt take a bad hit and gets injured
he starts they win some flacco becomes the new broadway joe

but its joe on the jets nevermind

i always had a feeling he would end up either on the jets or eagles being a jersey boy i mean

jersey joe flacco

hes bacccccccccck
before the season i told my friends flacco would be starting at some point this season and they laughed
cant wait to see that checkdown jk joe cool is the man
it doesnt matter who is the qb if they dont fix that horrific oline
lowkey did the jets just become elite
always wish the best for joe he brought stability to the ravens for the 1st time in franchise history turned the team into a perenial contender ill be rooting for the jets this week
ill be watching maybe the last game you see joe play
lets go

because we blitz so much otherwise we cant generate pressure
because we blitz a ton to make up for our lack of edge rush and screens are the natural rock to that sizzor also our ilbs are inexperienced and coverage is the weakest part of their game
humphrey lined up in a blitz against the best qb in the league start there
we dont have good coverage lbs in my opinion usually good coverage lbs are good at play recognition and are generally the captain of the defense who can change the play based on what they see from the offense ray lewis luke kuechly bobby wagner and patrick willis are some good examples of this
since as a franchise we have never and i mean ever been able to successfully execute a screen the defense gets no practice seeing what ones supposed to look like but since flacco and ray rice literally made their bones on dump off passes 4th and 29 lol i have no excuse for why were unable to defend them

brings back memories
it was  can you link it
removed


happy death day
thats a new one
you called
death is our main personality trait

i would consider adding these to my collection even though the collection is only 70s 80s and a random 90s vintage sunnies
link
definitely interesting i couldnt pull those off though

last year he had a groin injury before he played the jets on thursday night football all week sports segments were is lamar jacksons playing style catching up to him or how much longer will he last in the nfl now that he had a groin injury then he proceeded to break mike vicks record and throw for 5 touchdowns
already know rnfl is gonna have a field day with this
lamar missed a couple of practices during training camp with a groin injury lamar was asked about it upon his return lamar said that he felt good enough to practice but didnt because the ravens were being cautious

that is what this sounds like lamar is probably dealing with a sore knee and is being given extra time to recover
do they practice tuesdays
i hope this isnt like the time perriman had a not serious injury
this is not ideal
he probably just got the day off
mcsorley to start
trying to not be an alarmist but missing a whole wednesday practice is not ideal cincinatti is the optimal opponent for this to pop up tho
he needs to be at practice hes looked god awful so far this year

shit looks like its from 2015
honestly looks like it would have been a very light practice and anyone who wasnt feeling 100 was sat
injury report team

hopefully just a rest day for most vet days minor injuries
its not even halloween yet thats scary
you want a silver lining its that madubuike was a full participant could give a little more juice up front
so most of our starters ok
what is nir for calais


thats tough
i have this and love it
where did you get this gem
wow thats unreal nice find

ol scoring vs wft including

1 a 3rd straight strong game from matt skura
2 regression by tyre phillips
3 an outstanding fillin job by zeus at lt
4 play with positive portent by dj fluker at rt
they gotta consider making a switch at rg i feel cant help but think fluker or powers could be an improvement
so it looks like our issues are at both of the guard positions which makes sense that roman is trying to do more on the outside as opposed to calling inside runs cause the guards are weak

it looks like your shoes are wearing sombreros
all that yellow looks more like a lakers color way
these are sick bro will look raw with a jersey
heat bro
thats fire bro


no he was already declining before the elevator incident due to injury
definitely a ring of honor lock for us
probably not but i do say hall of very good
we will find out because jk dobbins is ray rice ii
i doubt he could have made the hof he was already on the decline when that incident happened if teams really thought he had a lot in him still he would have been signed by someone it was an intersection of bad pr and declining play

it really sucks because i think he is a much better person than that one incident reflects
no he was washed
he didnt come back into the nfl because of how publicised it was and he was coming off a very bad year what adrian peterson did was worse and hes still allowed back in the nfl hes still in the league for 2 reasons

1 hes still a good player despite his age
2 what he did has been largely forgotten by the public eye and people still think corporal punishment is ok with kids despite there being a lot of evidence showing that physical discipline only really produces negative outcomes for a child
it sucks he never got another chance i still believe he had something left its just odd he gets banned for life but greg hardy ap hunt tyrek and others still got another chance

2nd one tho
yes set the second one to my wallpaper so good
you made these jesus christ these are fire

i dunno you seem a little truss
among truss
3x speed activated
guys youre not gonna believe me earl thomas was with his brother on top of a body
opponents ankles purple 8 looking kinda sus
cant be caught
his speed is always set higher than everyone else
i dont know saw the oline near the vents lookin real sus
speed turned all the way up
earl thomas looking real sus
aaaand saved
the realism is uncanny how did you achieve such a facsimile for the truss neck
purple looking sus

not me swear to god
exactly paris wtf
it means youre talking about the browns too much lol
rnfl
not me i hate the browns

stop with this shit meme already bunch of tryhards
mcsorley is not nfl starter material
its a divisional game so things might get wacky still want to use baltimore in my eliminator pool though
it feels like too much joe burrow has no quit in him from what ive seen it doesnt really matter though if the bengals defense is dogshit
the spread against washington was 13 and cincy is definitely better than the football team we ended up beating the football team by 14 obviously no bet is guaranteed but cincy is the right pick against the spread
with the way our secondary was getting cooked left and right for the past 2 weeks joe burrow might turn into our fucking kryptonite like andy dalton did not saying we going to lose these next 2 gimmies but i wouldnt be entirely surprised if we lost 1 against the eagles or bengals our defense is still top 5 but a defense can only keep you in ball games for so long offense better get it together in these next 2 games because november is goin to be tough
cincinnatis defense is so much worse than washingtons the discrepancy between what our offense can do to their defense vs what their offense can do to our defense favors us pretty significantly even if burrow is the real deal

plus wink is excellent when it comes to confusing rookie qbs with complex schemes and looks and cincy simply doesnt have the coaching to counter that

so no 13 points is not too many
their ol and defense is quite bad but as long as aj green is on the field you never know
it is definitely too many points id use the chargers i think they cover the plus 8 pretty easily there offense while its inconsistent is enough with there great defense to keep them in games closely even without there top weapons the bucs offense is better then the saints and on top of this the saints defense which i thought would carry them has looked like shit if you dont have them i like the chiefs minus 125
i hope we run 80 of the time



i have typically been going purple for offense and black for defense i dont think you can go wrong either way though my purple lamar jersey is really nice if you can afford it go for the pricier option with the stitching and be careful when you clean it
personally i think the black looks better

she single
who cares if the color is perfect you got yourself an amazing wife right there dont you let her go

edit i honestly really love this shade of purple tbh
really awesome
would love to see that purple on our helmets for some thursday night game or some shit
thats rad did she paint it on
is that a snorlax in your cup holder
why do we have the dark bluish purple color and then the true violet purple has anyone noticed this
i love it great work
thats awesome your wife is dope
hey as a fyi that isnt the correct shade of purple
thats a great shade of blue right there boys

edit purple walls help with sex life

well hello there sweet prince
i miss the bank
just look at it
meanwhile florida man governor has approved full capacity

op these are amazing could we get an album or something of all the matchups together
that cat is so cute it almost makes me conjure up some kind of empathy for the striped brownsalmost
cute kittens vs happy purple birds

do you have a twitter i wanted to post this and credit you
this is the best artwork in the history of all of the artwork keep doing this the people are behind this

your raven looks like a happy little turtle as a terp this makes me extra excited
your raven beak looks like a penis just sayin

a whole lot of coffee
very large truss

averett knows hell be targeted this is not an insult our dbs include peters humphrey smith and clark it is literally ocs job to target the weak link or unproven variable on a defense i guess he didnt have to say it publicly but its hard to know what context this was in
even stevie wonder could see the chiefs were going to avoid our blitz attack not wink
would be cool to be proven wrong about averett
brutal coach keeping it real
well yeah because stevie wonder isnt blind
they are who we thought they were
theyre really about to give a free fucking win to the steelers from their stupidity
god i hope they get throttled the rest of the season for nearly destroying it through reckless stupidity
how are the titans still listed as number 1 in their division same question about the steelers if neither of these teams play another game they just win their division this is stupid
wonder if all that spitting simmons does is the cause of their outbreak
my hatred of the tiddlywinks has somehow grown even stronger
and we let em off the hook
wow if the league makes them forfeit bills players wont get paid for the game
they should sign earl thomas just because
these posts didnt age well
this aint it
who gets an int first this year chuck or deshon
deshon for me hes already a ballhawk the more he gets comfortable look out
deshon off a tip chuck will get one after from reading the qb
chuck has better positioning through the first 4 games so ill go chuck i think deshon will get better as the season goes on but hes just not there yet
chuck hes the swiss army knife on our defense

chuck gets the first int by a over thrown route

deshon gets it off reading the qb

he was signed to a 20 year 44 million per year extension
hes gonna run for pres in 2044
they could be giving him a hard time seeing as it took 3 games to get his first sack maybe they are playfully suggesting his next wont occur until 2044
im going with this judon thinks he is better than ed reed marlon humphrey combined has been saying so to anyone who will listen to him and all those teammates are subsequently roasting him about it
is he expecting a kid maybe another judon who would start theoretically playing in the nfl in the year 2044
do you have an example i just looked at the handful i follow on ig and none of them had anything about judon other than the wallpaper the team ig put out yesterday
one of the ravens opponents next season is kcat mt
i hope we can go
lets hope we dont get shit on again
good this matchup needs to keep happening so we can know where we stand to be the best you gotta beat the best cant hide from them til postseason
thats gonna be the leaguewide season opener
good it will be the second time we beat them after the afc championship game
please not early in the season again we need inseason game tape against reid to even stand a chance and that will give us enough time to have beaten covid enough to have a full stadium

lets face it lamars not as young as he was last year
i think its gotta be precautionary he never showed any sign of injury during the game was out messing around with haskins on the field after and he seemed totally normal doing press yesterday

unless he like tripped on some stairs i dont see how it could be a serious thing im guessing its just some soreness and theyre being extra careful but it does seem strange
lets see what happens friday if he misses another practice i will be worried i do not want to see rg iii on the field unless were up by 30
reason for concern or just precautionary
hmmmtwo days in a row worries me a little its still early but any chance he sits on sunday
they said yesterday was precautionary and i bought it but today im a little worried weve been here before where harbs downplays an injury so nobody knows whats really going on and we find out its worse than expected especially when all weve been hearing sense the cheifs loss all weve heard is these issues will get worked out in practices if lamar isnt practicing their not getting worked out and i just feel like they wouldnt hold him out of practice for no reason two days in a row but idk shit so i guess well see on sunday
bengals fan here and the sentiment in the bengals subreddit is that we hope lamars injury isnt serious and he plays we know were not going to the playoffs this year but we would like to see where we match up well and where we need to improve and we would like the ravens to be at full strength when they play

if it was big ben we would probably feel differently because fuck the steelers
flashbacks to the perriman rookie year fiasco hope lamar is truly ok
i have to guess it wasnt severe enough to warrant an mri and if i did we could have conclusive info on whether or not hes out for weeks and not be in this day to day stuff


can someone who works in healthcare explain a little more i believe there is a difference between a knee sprain and knee strain is a strain less severe and is it more likely hes dealing with that rather than a sprain
i wonder why theyre being so secretive about it
can someone explain to me why john harbaugh has been so secretive with injury info recently

its not your fault if hes hurt just tell us the whole truth otherwise it makes me assume the worst
a minor knee injury doesnt make you unavailable for two straight practices this is like breshad all over again lmfao
precautions arent inherently 24hrs jeez lamar could show up sunday with zero practice and beat the bengals
if i had to guess they are being extra cautious because he is their baby that sounds sus i mean in a metaphorical sense not an endearing one
mdden crse
we can all thank greg roman and his glorious rpo for this

harbs totally would put a smiley face on a note like that haha
how is an nfl head coach gonna have the penmanship of a 3rd grader smh lol
did he write that left handed
99 football 1 penmanship
pretty sure coach baked the og ravens cake that created the meme
zero chance he writes his own name like that

just fyi rbengals is saying our corners are lackluster and aj green will have a huge day

but thats cool they have fucking confidence in their team unlike this place because we lost one fucking game to the chiefs and we are not scoring 40 a game only 30
sundays game has me worried not just because of this but because of cincys talent at the skill positions

do we even need lamar
i showed this to my 8year old daughter as she was watching tv and she ran back to her room to finish her homework thanks for your help
idk he hasnt made any big plays but with tavon going down and wink moving jimmy around i think hell have more chances to make plays i havent been a fan of his but i think he has a big game soon
his coverage is generally good he just has horrible ball skills
lets hope so if he steps up and we have peters humph and a decent averette we are gonna be chillin
he might be even worse than peters in run support but ive been pleasantly surprised with his coverage i really thought we were going to see him getting targeted on every big down but that hasnt been the case he gave up some plays against kc but so did everybody and if anything he was targeted less than some others

if he keeps up this improvement hell be a solid cb3 before you know it
he has not made many plays but he has given up plenty of plays
averett is garbage bring back carr
i have said hes not trash like some people think and i think hes got potential but i dont wanna see him playing over 80 of defensive snaps every game let jimmy play more outside keep clark and elliott at safety and bring co cap in at sub lb on 3rd downs

wow this is really unexpected to me anyone have any idea why clearing room for someone

wow thats wild didnt expect that i wonder if were signing brandon carr like most think or bringing in a player via trade

gotta be one of the two
damn thats kind of a shocker were pretty thin at safety
wow pff is going to have a reeeeee moment after this one
is this making room for a trade
remember when he was going to challenge to start and then be the third safety
did geno have a spot on the 53 if i remember correctly he did
any guesses why it must be to make room for an acquisition or just that geno stone was dead weight i choose the former for my own sanity
why who is replacing him
could we be trying to move him to practice squad
not my iowa boy
hes been inactive every game so he hasnt even managed to carve out a role on st i cant say they are wrong to do it but it feels odd to see us cut a pick in the year we drafted them
so theres the eric weddle and brandon carr ideas but tony jefferson cant have a very high price tag right now right
was rooting for him to take the starting spot when we got rid of earl thomas best of luck to stone
this just in ravens have signed cfl yukon yaks safety bearl bhomas
gilchrist getting promoted
dang i really had hopes for him but as always in harbs and edc we trust
im hoping its to mke room to sign clay matthews to help our passrush

i know i shouldnt be surprisedbut im surprised that people are still fucking dumb enough to compare black people to monkeys
the last line ruins a pretty good meme cmon now
the last line made this meme go from shitpost in good fun to delete worthy
who do we have as more attractive than joe flacco

dunlap and atkins use to be some bulls not going to lie not so scared of them anymore though

as is tradition not the knee injury part the illness part

this is the 2nd or 3rd time lamar has come down with an illness before a matchup against the bengals

no lie that face is scary
weird as fuck

pumpkin king
here

biden

trump

huge news for the movement in very glad that the public knows where our future leaders stand on this hot button issue
uhhh biden wasnt even quoted in that article you linked
the great unifier
this needs to be a question at the next presidential debate sir is flacco elite please answer clearly for the american people
finally
damn not sure who to vote for now
wtf i suddenly love obama and trump
nice to see them both get off the fence about this
biden never said that
its about damn time
this election just got interesting
ah this was my pivot issue

now i dont know who to vote for
fake news biden did not say that
i hope he plays well but after that kc game last year i cant see him ever playing well in the league again
hmm they think the jets qb is elite cool
i hate to say this as a ravens fan butwho cares
clearly hes been injured most of the season since hes around other former ravens


view poll
i said yes assuming that just means we win
you guys are underestimating us a little bit
i said yes but have it ending closer to 42069
3323 us and were pissed
the bengals are not that bad itll be a 1417 point differential most likely
6969 tie

the ravens schedule was much tougher last yr
noted
i hope lamar read that and says and i took that personally
whats tough about our schedule other than the patriots and our own division
bleacher report likes eating crow so lets serve them crow in february
i saw that i guess thats why they play the games
its only 4 games so far and dont wanna be cocky but who else stands out way but the chiefs

obviously disappointed hes engineered an incredibly creative run game and has helped lamar tremendously in his development that being said we can find a replacement james urban our qb coach is well liked and said to be a guru having been an understudy to roman may have picked up a trick or too idk
well adapt with culley as oc and urban as asst hc

damn i cant keep up with all of these injuries didnt even know hollywood was hurt

every week this season i will be doing a crappy photoshop for our matchup here are the past weeks submissions

week 1 don lamar

week 2 the texans chainsaw massacre

week 3 over the top

week 4 he got game

bengals fan here good luck to you guys just hoping itll be an exciting game usually is with these two
i guess if you didnt comment in here you fucked up lol
haha someone gold bombed this thread lol
whos gold loaded
im awake pounded some straight up black coffee in my ravens mug and i saw a glimpse of the future lamar throws for five tds
i thought my phone was glitching seeing all those golds
time to make burrow look like a rookie
pumped for today but would be very foolish for us to look past this opponent the bengals are a rebuilding team but burrow is dangerous and i figure we might have trouble with mixon on those screen passes and covering a bigbodied wr like higgins they do have a lot of talent and geno atkins makes his season debut today
its 2 am in the morning for me but fuck it im hyped
send joe burrow back to middle school


a steelers fan
leggoooo
big truss
a little worried about burrow today but lets get it
lamars gonna go off today
a little over 30 mins til kickoff and its half past midnight where im atman im in for a long night gonna grab my coffee later so i can watch the whole game hopefully
llama time
i love goooollllllldddddd
lets gooooo i love me a good ol rain game
is going to be a fun one lets go ravens
rockhard
boudda drop a w on em lets goooooo


im pretty sure fat dak could play oline better than his actual line
you just know mayfield is going to be fat later in his career
lamar looks like hed fit right into my friend group
quality shitpost keep em coming
personal experience tells me once you finish playing a sport its easy to continue eating the same way
1 of these hasnt been changed at all

fat lamar looks like he can make the hell out of some ribs

funny how bens is the only one unedited oh thats the joke isnt it
fat dak looks like daniel cormier in the face
well ben rsteelers is a fat ass now so
mahomes looking like he went on a cheese burger binge with andy reid
fatrick mahomes looks like someone i would want to hang out with

pretty sure rodgers and ben are close to being at that point
i would love to see a fat lamar jackson running at the same speed and agility as regular lamar jackson that would be amazing
dak looking like a 1st round interior pass rusher
fat dak looks like hed fuck you up fat russell wilson looks like my uncle scott
why does br look the same
fat lamar is clarence beeftank


so nobody going to talk about how big ben looks the same

lol
could also be titled ok dear point to the man who raped you
like suiting up for battle so that i can scream at my tv i can only imagine what putting that jersey on feels like for them lets go beat the bengals today big truss
all the best today i hope you guys get to 41
its a ritual same socks same pants same lamar jersey every game same thing for the little dude
hell yeah coach
yess i absolutely love it although i need a new one still wearing a flacco that ive had for years would love to get a lamar jersey one of these days
my lamar jersey came in the mail this week my first one
we have a bye week then we play the bucs in tampa next week
literally the same put on the game the didnt realize i had on my jersey and rushed to go put it on before the kickoff
wearin my tucker jersey right now man

thats pretty damn funny right there
and i hear hes a great locker room guy his attitude is so infectious

tiger king was a really bad show but this is a really great meme

go lamar

its an interesting perspective and i agree that it contextualizes our pass rush failures as partly due to martindales schemes not completely shouldered by judon still doesnt answer why he makes edge money if hes not that or whether judons versatility is worth a less effective blitzbased pressure scheme that sacrifices pieces in coverage or why even when judon does get his hands on a qb he cant take them down im all for using each player for their actual strengthsnot what we wish they had but we just have to ask what is the outcome for the team
it doesnt agree with my narrative
qb hits are a bullshit stat

this article didnt make note of the amount of plays we send 5 rushers judon gets most his sacks and hits on

he isnt good numbers speak hes an olb by so he should play like one

big watch fan and big ravens fan happened to stumble across this 1997 ravens watch from the fossil nfl collection that some random lad in tennessee was selling covidfree thank god and im loving repping it on game days so far
thats super sharp
thats bad ass
this is super clean

yknow i was doubtful when the ravens gave up on lamar jackson so soon but this murray guy is at least pretty decent
lamar isnt the most refined passer we know this but these are reps hes gonna need this is how hell develop the talent is there timing chemistry and precision will come with reps and chances calm down
how about queen absolutely closing that hole
how atrocious is the bengals oline that our defense is getting consistent pressure on burrow
wink masterclass today while roman is eating crayons
this season should further solidify yandas hof resume night and day
this sub is being way too buddy buddy with burrow hes an afcn rival qb now fuck this guy on a molecular level
quit calling him murray
lamar murray for mvp
nobody

cbs murray
it really looks like they told lamar not to run this game because of the knee hes ignoring running lanes he usually takes
duvernay should be taking boykins routes
5th interceptable pass to cincy 3rd right to a defender

this is lamars worst game of his career
marlon pay me

team okay but we expect you to play up to it

marlon grip it and rip it

team big truss
the football exists

marlon
lets go raiders and eagles
queen made that play happen with his pursuit otherwise burrow would have ran for the first
them saying murray is really pissing me off
the extreme disrespect by this announcer calling the mvp another players name its unreal
fast black qb guess thats kyler murray
marlon humphrey has cemented himself as the best corner in the game 3 ffs 1 int top 5 in pass defenses hasnt given up a td this year stud
i only hope the ravens know they have a large talent gap with the bengals and are using this game to work on things only way i can wrap my head around the play calling
dawg we are bullying burrow

this is afc north football baby
he just said lamar jackson someone must have called into the booth
torrey tweeted if you want to see what abuse looks like go and watch the ravens defense today poor burrow earlier
there must be a lot of fans who werent here for the flacco days
with these statlines should queen be in the discussion for droy
pass is complete jeez whats wrong with this guy lmao
this is one of the worst commentated games ive ever heard
it should be a sin that were not using jk and dev more
love when a player gets paid and actually performs to that level feels so good to see
humphrey has 3 forced fumbles this year and ravens have returned two of them for a td dating back to start of last year humphrey has 4 ints 5 forced fumbles 3 fumble recoveries and 2 defensive tds jeffzrebiec
cbs with a shot of queens balls
are the raiders really about to beat the chiefs
murray count 3
joe burrow looks like macaulay culkin
hey burrow welcome to the afc north kid
rich how is it a bad decision we went 142 doing this shit and couldve put the dagger in them what an old school mentality we have dominated them on defense and couldve put the dagger in them there is no better time to go for it

we won the play too lamar just missed
every play burrow is getting hit jesus
this is definitely a welcome to the nfl moment for burrow hes looking like watson running got his life
meanwhile down in dc alex smith is taking the field for the first time since that injury
guys how glad are we that we only franchised judon and didnt give him the big extension really good decision by edc imo
this game legit should be like 700
i dont think ive ever wanted to stop watching a game were winning so much
if the eagles pill this one off i wont make fun of carson wentzs play for the whole week
some revisionist history going on in this thread about last year as if we didnt barely beat the bengals at home last year
bengals are down 270 and running more then us lol
this is the least blowout feeling blowout in a while
how many times is he gonna call him murray what the fuck
lamar jackson count 1
murray mandrews name a better duo
murray throws a td pass to mark andrews all the way from arizona
queen taking this rival personally hes been flying at 100mph all game
lamars homie just died cut him some slack
you know our kicker is the goat when i was disappointed with him missing a 61 yarder so badly at the bank
i am very sad he didnt hit that
looking at these comments youd think the score was reversed
boykin is so bad didnt even try for it cuts his routes early
lamars worst ever game in a ravens shirt would rather have it now than against a good team when it matters though
marlo dpoy
marlon humphrey worth every single penny
dpoy marlon humphrey lets get it trending
marlon is underpaid
i just want to say i am very happy that harbaugh finally listened to me and decided to have tucker kick it out of the end zone every time
go eagles go raidersgo flacco lol
pittsburgh giving up 29 to a team that tied with cincinnati lmfao
dobbins has just one carry 34 yards why dont they give him a practice reps in a game like this

can we start utilizing hollywood on slants cross routes etc
i know were winning but this offense hurts my eyes
unpopular opinion i am enjoying that we are winning and are not like the 2015 ravens
lamar missed two practices this week with a knee issue its very possible they told lamar to stay in the pocket and play this out differently this week it is the bengals after all why risk it and have him go crazy on a team when he doesnt need to
apologizing for the murray thing lol
lamar jackson stats right now

0 incompletions

0 ints

0 sacks

0 fumbles


he keeps calling him murray wtf
am i on drugs or has the commentator called lamar murray at least twice
it was to our benefit but that call was lame
this team just doesnt fuck around against bad teams
terrible decision to go for it on 4th and 6 should have just punted and trusted their defense
bitch they did trust the d thats why they could go for it on 4th and 6
morgan ray lewis cox
i miss yanda
bowser is looking way better than judon this season
we wont win the superbowl with the 31st passing offense plain and simple
part of what made us successful last year was effectively running the ball which forced the defense to sell out to stop the run allowing lamar more open looks by not establishing the run the defense is just playing pass d all game
idk how anyone can watch this offense the entire season so far and be confidentits not just today
and we get stuffed on a 3rd and two so much for the run game
this offense sucks today absolutely disgraceful they need to buy the dinner fucking expensive dinners next week
if we were playing any other team im pretty sure wed be losing this is such an overwhelmingly shitty performance on offense
marlon should be in consideration for dpoy hes an absolute turnover machine
friendship ended with offence defence is my new friend
dpoty and its not even close u fuckin momos
marlon humphrey could punch the depression out me
i want this damn shutout
is gumbel drunk or just not even watching the game
i know we all on roman right now but i really believe yanda was the glue keeping the offense together
take a shot every time the announcer calls lamar murray
as good as andrews lookswe need to get lamar another certified passing threat other better teams will key in on him and make lamar uncomfortable throwing to his other options
how is our long snapper the first one to the ball lol
this is gonna be the year that solidifies marshal yanda as a first ballot hof lol
lamars knee clearly isnt 100
honestly dobbins should be starting ingram doesnt look as good this year and edwards is decent but not better than either of the above two
this defense is going to mask how poor the offensive playcalling has been
burrow has aged 30 years in the last 2 hours
was that another shitty route by boykin
all the running success on that drive and you pass on 3rd and three lmao
imagine how scary good this defense would be if you could magically replace judon with an inhisprime sizzle
does marlo have the same amount of sacks as judon lol
everyone is so concerned about this offense and we are 41 ill be concerned in december if we look like this but this is the fifth game of the year with no preseason boykin is a bust and snead issnead i hope duvernay comes along but until then we only have 2 real recieving threats

boykin gave up on that route that everyone is killing lamar for
holy shit this offense is literally making me nauseous
this is classic ravens football now offense not doing shit but somehow blowing the opponent out because of defense
the offense better be buying the defense an expensive ass dinner after this game
marlon humphrey for dpoy
andddd thats why you pay the man
marlon and queen are the future were in good hands raven fans
football is important to him

what kind of stupid cliched bullshit commentary is that
philly is giving pittsburgh a game right now kinda like every game in the nfl is not a surefire win and its a little bit harder to consistently blow out bad teams than this team makes it look
raiders up 3024 against the chiefs steelers only up 2 against the eagles
calais is a spectacular signing
terrible spot i dont think he made it to the line of scrimmage
bengals running the clock out so they can gtfo and go home
lol seriously a fg so you dont get shutout pussies
like bunting in the 9th to break up a nohitter
we all calling lamar murray from here on out right
great extra point by justin murray
lamar murray throws complete to mark kittle inside the 5
i feel a little bit of empathy for burrow if it were baker of ben i would feel nothing
not even mad at judon anymore queen just took out his boy lmaooo
thats just greed by harbaugh theres no reason to go for a 4th and 6 up 17 when you can just pin them back and probably end up with the same field position a few minutes later
joe is getting murdered
theres literally a defender every time lamar leaves the pocket lol thats why we dont run the ball as much last year thats an easy 68 yards this year its a loss or throwaway
wtf is with the right side of our line this season feels like every single drive theres a free rusher coming from the right
it really speaks to how bad the bengals are that its 170 with how bad lamar and the playcalling have been
announcer just said pass is complete this dude is really bad lol
its ok tuck thats 61 yards
madubuike looked excellent
boykin was literally run blocking wtf was that
lamar jesus my dude
something is off with lamar ive never seen this tier of play from lamar where is the elite pocket awareness and elite decision making from last year
patrick queen is now the lsu alum with the most touchdowns in this game
i really hope were able to get humphrey a ring
marlon fucking humphrey man nobody is more deserving of the bag than this guy
fruit motherfuckijhr punch i swear that man forces a fumble every other game
man marlon is insane how this man isnt front runner for dpoy i dont understand
i love patrick queen the man is everywhere
why tf has lamar thrown 37 times in a game weve been up since q1
marlon might be best play making corner we have ever had
wait until the new fans who are upset with this game realize that this was basically every ravens game back in the day with the offense not doing anything but the defense blowing out every opponent
lets go philly
yo philly com on cuz you got this
humphreys right hook is underrated
did calais just tackle two guys at once
steelers blowing the game
can we get a meme for marlo using the super punch out picture lol
patrick queen defensive roty

marlon humphrey dpoty

lets start the campaigning
sad mahomes and the announcers cant do their usual brainless slobbering

inject this shit straight into my veins
haha get fucked kc

sidenote its still scary af that they managed to put up 32 points in a loss
unpopular opinion im so glad the ravens are using these games against lesser opponents to better their passing game we know they can run all over teams but we need this passing in the playoffs
bro these newscasters get paid so much money for this job they should know the rosters of both teams top to bottom its literally their job not being able to get the name of the fucking quarterback right is annoying fire these fools
duvernay burned his man there
he was gonna run for that 1st but queen started booking it
queen has been amazing for us already dudes going to be a raven for life
stop calling lamar murray please holy fuck
lamar frustrated good
murray counter 7
balmer murrayland
queen is our new defensive king
you guys are getting pissed at the pass play callings but most of them arent that bad if lamar actually makes the throw
i feel bad for burrow honestly lmao
3rd and 24 against the bengals used to be a scoring play for them lol
burrow deserves better lol this is sad
gray rainy day no fans lamar is off and no energy

no offense to the bengals or burrow but against a lot of other teams wed be worse off than up 170
i want a fucking touchdown on this drive
i wanted that sooooooo bad
he had the distance right only a bit off
he actually just caught himself saying murray
hollywood finally got some yac
hollywood is half the size of everyone on the field yall want him to get injured lmao

it should be like 350
that fumble was too slippery mp put too much on it
peters with the create a player madden stats an interception a sack and a forced fumble
boykin is terrible what is this stupid announcer talking about you got to give the receiver a chance
how weird is it that flacco and leveon bell are on the same offense
instead of only focusing on the bad theres a ton of good things to take away from this game

queen is clearly amazing mcphee is winning 1v1s bowser and ferguson look great winks blitz schemes look a lot more creative
great seeing madibuike out there his draft video was so sincere and sweet
tf is lamar doing hes lucky he hasnt thrown like 4 picks today because bungles are just dropping them all
offense has regressed so much
lmao fucking humphrey did it again
winning a game 270 despite lamar playing the worst game of his career

this team is wild humphrey is lethal queen is fast as hell
marlon doing this every week actually feels unfair how
my queen jersey comes in next week
we have dpoy and droy
droy queen dpoy humphrey
yeeeesh hump its like he gets at least one of these every game
dpoty
marlo is so fuckin good yo its unreal queen is a playmaker too once we get a good dline were stepping into 2000 territory
fruitpunch
marlon fucking humphrey
the chad defense vs the the virgin offense
wow marlon humphrey deserves more money queen
m a r l o n h u m p h r e y

can we give this man more money
defense really saving our shit today some classic ravens football to educate the bandwagons
marlon humphrey is the only stealer i root for
you got this eagles
looks like the bengals just want to go home cant wait to see lamar attempt 7 more passes
marlon humphrey needs to be in dpoy talks patrick queen needs to be in droy talks like as soon as possible tonyjefferson
false fucking start you hear chuck
yall got any more of them turnovers
thats a bad spot tho for real he was like a yard short
although lamar has looked bad today a ton of qbs this season seem off the injury and short offseason probably isnt helping
we are spoiled we are going to win 273 and i feel like our offense was hot garbage today and almost all of the season so far
please eagles dont choke
raiders killing the chiefs right now in front of their fans and i am here for it
god i hate announcers during chiefs games
more duvernay please
why tf do we always switch to passing bruh just keep running it
duvernay was open
good grief guys get your tackling down
bruh watching patrick queen turn on the burners and bee line for burrow had me hyped cant wait to see what he accomplishes
queens speed came in huge there if thats one of our slow lbs from last year burrow runs for a first
the announcer has called lamar murray twice now
who the eff is murray its lamar you idiots
how does he keep calling him murray hes the fucking mvp
someone tell him the ravens qb is lamar jackson and not orioles great eddie murray
murray count 6

this a joke at this point
i needed to change my flair might as well make it something stupid at this point
our offense is getting it done but it still looks off
murray must murray his murray murray for murray to murray his murray
our first round pick from lsu their first round pick from lsu
queen absolutely rocked burrows shit my god
ugh queen is already a game changer without a regular preseason as a 21 year old he gonna be a stud
and now a flacco special 3yrd pass on 3rd and 8
lamar playing so sloppy
bengals oline making our pass rush look godtier
i want to see some more duvernay action
burrows 300 yard streak is way more impressive after getting a first hand look at the bengals offensive line so so bad
greg roman going back to the prohibition era wit these bootlegs man
this is a solid football team but the energy just isnt the same as last year not nearly as fun to watch more bad decisions whats different i wonder if its just the weirdness of the world right now with covid empty stadiums etc etc
i wish yanda played just 1 more year since this is the year we have a great shot at winning the whole thing and we really need him im glad he seems to be enjoying life more now though
this is bad film for when we play actual teams just give lamar a littler pressure and we have some real head scratchers you get the feeling they are artificially telling him to stay in the pocket and become something hes not
where is the lamar from week 1 regardless of the team he was hitting receivers and makin perfect reads

this is really bad
61 yarder at the bank with storm clouds rolling inand we all almost expected him to make it anyways
most kickers dont even try that kick still love you jt
still the best kicker in the nfl
how about our defense though guys its not like burrow has been trash up to this point
this halftime highlight show is being really generous to lamar
lamar is definitely not 100
lamar could have 34 interceptions this game i have no idea whats going on with him
roman lost his run playcall sheet
man elliot looks way more explosive on those fs blitzes than earl did last year
burrow might legit die this season at this rate hes getting hit by teams
that was definitely not a hold
greg just called lamar patrick after calling him murray a dozen times this is a problem
please fucking fire these trash ass low rate announcers
it really seems like once we went up 170 they said lets just use this as a scrimmage and try some of that passing stuff mahomes does
tucker really flirting with those goal posts
miles needs to just sit out for a week and just run routes for two weeks straight until he gets them into his head
this is just embarrassing hats off to our defense our offense is obviously good enough to beat the bengals but this performance is good for 6 points against the steelers

the raiders hung 24 on kc in the first half
umm false start
we are literally blowing out a team right now and i still feel worse about the ravens
i am confident marlon humphrey could get more sacks in a season than judon
guys its okay to say lamar has not looked good today or even the past couple weeks
up 200 first down pass fuck off roman
greg roman needs to lay off the drugs its starting to show
marlo is dpoy
and people still dont think marlo is a top three cb in the league hes top 2 and hes not 2
hump for dpoy
marlon is worth every penny
humphrey for dpoy if he keeps this up
marlon with the reacharound ball extraction
bengals options since mid 3rd

1 run and basically ff

2 pass and basically kill burrow
apology accepted
yeah thats not gonna save me

good on him for owning it
i want a shutout so badughh
anyone else here that actually enjoys when were up a ton and our opponents have long 4th quarter drives because it means less opportunities for offensive injuries
petition to rename this team the cincinnati mixons sign here with you doot
thank goodness offense didnt need to show up need to right the ship soon though
zac taylor is a coward lmfao
fg of shame
lmao this is soooo weak from cincy just run it a few times and kick a fg taylor is a beta male
qb knee injury missed practices
yall wtf is he doing why is he so bad

please chill
pathetic just absolutely pathetic with this kind of defensive domination and our run game once again flourishing when given the chance we should be leading this 500 170 is just pathetic at this point

we have some fucking unhinged fans lmaooo some of yall need help
for people criticizing roman on that 3rd down

roman called a run lamar checked into a pass boykin didnt know lamar checked into a pass which is why he went out to run block

miscommunication

dont listen to the commentator he doesnt even know the name of the nfls mvp
if only greg roman could show similar creativity with passing plays
lamar had a guy crossing wide open would been an easy first
lamar can be as frustrated as he wants with the offense but if he cant see wide open wrs he needs to start taking more responsibility
jesus christ that needs to be a sack
patrick queen almost got him
burrow wanted to run but queen had him cut off easily
these are announcers are so boring god pls kill me
will this announcer please learn the reigning unanimous mvps name holy shit
lamar does not look too happy right now
murray count 5
cardinals legend lamar murray
murray hands off to murray slips a tackle from murray and makes it down to the 4murray line
first touchdown of the lamar murray era
lamar mandrews is literally our only offense so far this season no wonder we got blown out vs the chiefs when mandrews had the worst game of his career
refs trying to figure out how murray snuck in
mark andrews is our offense
just ordered my murray groundhog jackson jersey
lets get marquise hill his first td of the year
we gotta feed mark kamara more
the demise of lamar jackson has been greatly exaggerated
the ravens sure look good for a team so many are unhappy with
another missed sack its ridiculous
burrows jersey is filthy

oh look judon offsides
who else is in the droy conversation this year queen is definitely near the top
this is burrows welcome to the nfl game unfortunately for him i cant tell if hes playing bad or his line is just worse than swiss cheese probably a bit of both
queen literally made no attempt to tackle burrow and just tried to kill himbut theyre really close
greg roman pumped for that false start so he can change from a run to a pass
ball was tipped yall calm down
why why does greg call 3rd down throws to a player not at the line to gain fucking horrible
gross i feel like the play was there though lj and andrews just didnt execute probably on lamar
bad throw love the 4th decision fuck the commentators 170 with a defence playing well is the perfect time to go for it
this d is angry today i love it
if only every team we played had the bengals oline
mcphee judon
so just fuck jk huh
could this be bowsers coming out party
this pressure is giving me a boner
gotta love the wire intro going into commercial
wow alex smith is in the game for washington
it feels like we should be up by 40
dobbins needs more touches
its ok tucker we still love you
ive never seen so many complaints about a 17point halftime lead
derek carr with 235 yards 3 tds on the chiefs we couldnt even get 100 passing yards
last years offense was historic i figured theyd be a drop off but does roman expect every run to go 10 yards everytime like these 34 yard gains are decent and we should continue chipping away with them the play calling has been so unbalanced
i really dont think lamar is playing that bad making it seem like hes the danny green of nfl lol
did the announcer just say lebron jackson
lamars not running because of his knee i think he was told not to risk it today
shouldnt we just be pounding and grounding with a 170 lead
why do you keep on saying murray
hes becoming self aware hes learning
heres a tweet of a compilation of the murrays from the first half
snead stopped running
man im so disappointed in 8 today
why the fuck do we keep doing a fake handoff on the opposite side of the rb
this offense is dead
our receivers just dont have it
so good at ball extractionwhoa
defense came to play lj just looks off i wonder if hes hurting more than theyre saying
lmao that fumble reminded me of this amazing play
boykin just giving up mid route
boykin not even trying smh
at least flacco scored we can be happy about that
like take boykin out and give duvernay reps seriously run more with dobbins i dunno what the fuck we think were doing such an ugly fucking game this game should be beyond reach right now
judons got more flags than a us embassy jfc
marlon is on track to be our best corner ever
marlons first sack
their o line is just there for show at this point
somebody post the meme of squidward looking out the window but its judon looking at literally the entire rest of the defense getting sacks on burrow
fire roman im done
what are these throws
lamar looks like shit throwing since the chiefs game

dude needs to get it together
lol at people calling out roman for lamar making horrible throws
wow lamar wtf his stat line looks ok but not passing the eye test today
ugh lamar is lucky not to have 3 picks this game
feel like im watching a 2006 game all good though theyll rebound
yeah the offense is completely hapless right now what is happening
offense looks like ass today
defense basically running the show on this one
defense looks amazing offense looks atrocious good old ravens football
marlo what the fuck are you drinking i want some
marlon getting ffs all the time
how does marlon do it
we were due for a defensive td
our defense has been insane today omg marlon humphrey what is that 3 games in a row with a forced fumble
i fucking love marlon humphrey
queen and humphrey a problem
defense came to play marlo is amazing im getting a jersey
marlon dpoy
lamar looksoff

so do you think the ravens are downplaying lamars knee injury i havent seen hardly any designed runs for him this game and a lot of his throws are sailing on him i think his knee is more hurt than theyre letting on and its showing thoughts
soon 1 hours of humphrey punching the ball out
didnt even know jimmy smith was playing today thats how quiet their offense has been
lol who was that yelling thats a false fucking start
im so baffled by romans play calling after last year i considered him one of the top o coordinators in the league but hes completely lost it i know were probably seeing different looks this year but hes gotten so far away from the run its disgusting to watch seems like he keeps trying to surprise teams by passing on 1st and 2nd down i feel like establishing the run is so important for our offense because it also opens up the play action i honestly feel like they could give me the playbook and i could call a better game roman needs to be better if we expect to contend this year
really be out here hoping we can keep the shutout
was kinda hoping wed shut them out
kinda salty about that
boooooooo have you no shame fg settling for no good jungle cats
did bengals really just kick a fg to say they didnt get shutout lmao what a cop out
chiefs about to go 41
amazing how pedestrian mahomes looks when his receivers arent wide open
the teams the steelers have beaten have a total of 3 wins those 3 wins came against the jets the jaguars and a garopolloless 49ers their record does not reflect their ability they have a lot to prove still
if we were playing a playoff team like this wed be getting embarrassed i dont care that we are winning 200 this win doesnt make me happy
lamar was god awful today
holy fuck a new play buy your lotto tickets
throwing the ball when we had a 30 yard run and are a running team come on
the sooner lamar learns duvernay is a reliable receiver who catches pretty much any ball in his area the better he was such a reliable receiver especially on 3rd down in college
ive never seen a defense that is so bad at tackling the qb its actually impressive
well bengals you were perfect on 4th down
fuck off the field young man
did the announcer just call lamar murray
i think duvernay was such a good add for our team incredible value in round 3
wtf are these announcers marcus brown calling lamar murray we keep getting the d team lol
am i tripping or does he keep calling lamar murray
who is murray
why is he calling lamar murray
thats our qb lamar murray
murray with the td
great patience from our guy kyler in the pocket just then
holding the fuck out of him too call that shit
nice field goal by murray butker
i love mark andrews but its frustrating how much our entire offensive depends on him having a good game
murray
this murray shit is insulting
friendship ended with lamar now murray is my best friend
the baltimore murrays
why the fuck does he keep saying murray
mark kittle with the 1st down
i swear we get the most pressure without a sack in the league
flacco is 69
the sack forced fumble by queen
queeeeeeeeen
judon is so awful i cant believe people still defend him
yaaaaaasss queen
the worst part about having lamar in fantasy is he is gonna get benched by the 4th q again so bobby 3 sticks can play
judon with the 4d chess move he knew that queen was going to force the fumble and be in a better field position so he purposely went offside
welcome to the north this is your life now joe
remember 34 years ago when bengals fans called this a rivalry
now this this puts a smile on my face
i love patrick queen so much
queen


checkmate
lmao surprised by the ravens going for it on 4th you havent been paying attention
lamar murray is having a hard time putting touch on the ball today
ugh lamar has looked real bad on the long touch passes all year and this is game 5 cant beat good teams if you cant take advantage when your receivers are wide open down the field
yo is it just me or has lamar been struggling with his passes this season compared to last whats going on with him
i need to stay out of this sub man people fucking freak out if everything doesnt go perfectly
pernell judon for 5 of the cost
i swear they pass to boyd just to activate our collective ptsd sometimes
burrow might die this year constant pressure
our defense is better than the steelers d
wtf is up with them not giving dobbins touches
we keep letting free rushers off the edge obj gotta clean that up
lamar is off today maybe lack of practice
lamar needs to make adjustments to the line when he sees the cornerlbs blitzing too many free blitzers today
we are so hilariously bad on bootlegs lol
our run defense has looked pretty good this year
burrows looking like kyle boller
gregs mind oh dobbins duv and edwards are playing well for us let me not utilize them anymore and see what happens
damn it hurts me to say this because i love ingram but i dont think he should be the rb1 anymore if we have gus and dobbins playing like this
yo this dudes lost it get him outta here

first the whole murray thing now he thinks and int is a completion
seriously jk does fucking work and then they just throw way too many times and expect it to work lamar looking very meh today too
lamar sucks right now
that pick was overdue sadly play before the screen was almost intercepted and mandrews prevented the other one
feels like it should be 400
imma need lamar to work overtime next week on throwing and his chemistry with other receivers
lamar looks like he missed practice this week
its clear that ingram isnt explosive enough to work as well behind this line because its weaker this year we need to use the speed advantage jk and gus gives to hit the outside where our better oline men are
man our offense hasnt been itself since week 2 fortunately being not ourselves is still enough to beat most teams but were capable of being so much better
we should have at least 27 right now
he had one job fire justin tucker trade him what a fraud s
hollywood almost had that td would help the offensive stats look better not that theyre bad
a mic caught someone calling flacco a fucking idiot in the cardinalsjets game get ready to riot flock
jk dobbins needs more touches 2nd and 8 is getting old
im convinced lamars knee is not 100 he would have run the ball more
has lamar even ran once this game
last year we would be winning by 50 the only difference is we dont zone read anymore
patriots entire offence is built around snapping it and throwing it quickly we seem to refuse to utilize any of that why not throw boykin a slant for 5 yards or an out to snead once in a while if we refuse to run it
we need faster routes the plays take way to long to develop we simply dont have the oline for long developing plays to work or receivers
elliot clean sack
elliott to burrow

we live in a society

bottom text
no shit dumb bel you do keep saying murray
why do i keep saying murray lmao
i have a theory gro is calling the game this way to get us more game experience trying to score by passing while were comfortably ahead instead of only doing that when we are losing and need to score by passing
why im keep saying murray lmaoo
dude just said coverage sack what sack
i dont understand why lamar has 35 pass attempts
wtf a coverage sack he threw the ball
fuck it keep throwing until they get it right
coverage sack on and incomplete pass
it was a coverage sack

on a play that wasnt a sack man these announcers are every bit as bad as this sub has been saying
defence is the reason were winning this one offence has looked choppy today
mp juiceman with an int sack and ff wtf
why do i keep saying murray
is our pass rush fixed

or are the bengals just very very bad
offense needs to put a drive together here
the optimist in me is going to say lamar isnt 100 healthy and this game wont define him going forward
roman deserves a lot of credit

tf are the announcers smoking romans sucked all season next to judon and the o line romans the biggest weakness
heaven is a lamar jacksonjoe flacco double box on redzone
judon is a net negative
something about our offense seems really off this season
lol that was clearly a false start
judon offsides never
lets go welcome to the afc north joe burrow

they are terrorizing him he looks frightened out there what a sad excuse of an offensive line
run the ball
burrows gonna have nightmares where he just sees flashes of purple
how many wouldabeen picks has lamar thrown today 4
lamar must be hurt or sick or something
worried about our offense
queens first td

also marlon doing marlon shit not even excited about that him not having a strip is more a disappointment at this point dude has us spoiled for sure
marlon humphry would pickpocket your scrotum if he thought there was a ball in there to steal
i fucking love humphrey

and add queen to that list
if the offense wont do it then the defense will do it
our defence is better offence than our offence
humphrey is the best player in the league at forcing fumbles
humphrey makes me moist
fruit punch queen td love to see it
killa queen
man our offense has been struggling but this defense is fucking insane
man lets keep things positive this is a blow out too much negativity surrounding a big win lets gooo
keys to success target marlon humphrey lol
marlon signed da ting and kept producing instead of taking it easy like some of these high prices guys love to see it
marlons deal is already looking like a steal holy shit
marlon is the best nfl cb no doubt hes fucking insane
where was this defense against the chiefs
lets go eagles
ferguson bowser madbuike all had a really good game today
damn it i dont want them to score any points
can we ever have decent play by play guys or
i also need the eagles and raiders win their games today
happy dont have to see our offense come back and play offense desperately needs to find its stride or we wont be beating elite teams
i cant figure out if kyler murray is good or not
ravens radio announcers are saying this cowardly kick deserves to get blocked and returned for a touchdown lol
zac taylor would bunt in a perfect game
you have a rookie fucking qb against one of the best defenses on the league and you dont try and score thats horrible coaching
uhhhhh lamar is limping
rgiii saving lamar from a negative yard game
ahahahaha

get fucked chiefs
man i hate this settling for field goals shit
lamar has just looked poorly at times this season
now that tucker missed one the announcers can stop trying to jinx the rest of his kicks
never been so worried about a 41 team in my life
its not spoiled to want your mvp qb and offense to play better not even to mention this is 3 weeks in a row of the offense not looking very good
lamar looks like dog shit today he should have 3 picks thrown
maybe we should admit lamar has looked bad this season
since lamar jackson became the starter in wk 11 2018 bal has scored 20 pts in 28 straight regularseason gms tying the greatest show on turf rams 9900 for the 2ndlongest such streak in nfl history

p mannings broncos 30 straight gms 1214 have the longest streak nflresearch
good day i in europe i like america i like the hand egg game what you call football and i like hot dog too i like the ravens football club i cheer and scream at my screen playing an interweb stream of ravens club football i hope ravens win i think ravens win good day
bro i have done so much today already i lifted chest and tris ran a 5k swept mopped and did the dishes wtf is wrong with me
was that a sack for judon
big play first end around ran successfully in years
lets use duvernay more hes a weapon
he should have gone under
i never understood hearing 49ers and bills fans complaints about roman they always said though that his first year with them he was great then after that fell off a cliff

so far this year i see exactly what they mean
lamar needs to trust his other receivers duv was open
defense is not gelled offense is off and lamar has not stepped up in the pass game
edit still a very good team but not as good as late 2019 gotta step up and gel
burrow surprisingly athletic
gotta finish these sacks man ugggggh
ill never forgive tyler boyd
i think duv has a better chance of being wr1 for us than boykin
that was such a huge play by queen there i fucking love this guy
what the fuck is up with our play calling why do we never run the ball or atleast run tradional passes like sluggo slants floods
our route combinations make 0 sense sometimes
can these announcers stop calling lamar jackson murray
jesus fucking christ his name is not murray
murray count 4
i can tell lamar is having less fun than last year lol
can we actually get this announcer fired post game this is actually pathetic you wouldnt expect a teacher to come in and teach the wrong names
lamar murray
that was an absolute dart by lamar
they need to scheme plays not intended for andrews or hollywood more lol
fuck all football teams from ohio
ah the classic 100 ravens lead
idk what happened but why did this offence switch from what was working last year no read options a lot less pre snap motion and the only pass plays are unoriginal or seam routs to mandrews if they shut down mark we have no passing targets
the baltimore murrays are my favorite team
murray almost broke one
omfg with this murray bullshit
someone needs to tell that guy his name is jackson its on the back of his damn jersey
kyler looks taller than i remember
mandrews came to fucking play
its not like lamars a famous player or even the one guy people would know on our team
lamar be launching the ball like a rocket
so yeah like i said earlier best quarter and 10 seconds of football this team has played this season
all i have is redzone today and they just keep casually cutting to the ravens absolutely destroying them lmao
judon is so trash
yasss queen
queen just smashed his old qb and got the to
judon more liek judoff
queens such a baller
lsu on lsu action
quuuueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
jesus were murdering them
queen is a statsheet hero
queen got his sack fumble on burrow
queen just fucking killed joe
patrick murray with the hit on burrow
patrick fucking queen
queen is playing like he knows the qb pretty interesting how much hes popping this game guess it makes sense
lightning mcpatrickqueen
oh my god

what a hit poor kid didnt even feel it coming hes running for his life out there
queen heard yall was talkin shit
take a swing at queen now joey boi
scott hanson apparently queen and burrow didnt get along at lsu
lamars gotta start looking for his other receivers man if were gonna pass 45 times a game we gotta at least try to change this shit up
needed a better throw but should have punted
throwing a low percentage pass on 4th and 6 near midfield questionable to say the least
that pass right there is the one lamar has to hit
take notes judon
holy shit the bengals are trash i know thats not that surprising but i assumed theyd improved as their results so far didnt look too bad nah utter trash
i thought our oline needed help jesus
bengals like so bad it makes our shitty pass rush look great
i know all games are not equal but this a good sign considering how close the browns played the bengals imo
if we blowing them out by mid 3rd quarter hopefully they take burrow out not tryna see the rook get injured lmao
feed gus we need to feed him early in games
feed my boy gus and he will make 30 minutes disappear
up 17 on a bad team is the time to try out a few things and establish some touches i want to see some duv proche and dobbins even ricard
lamar throwing like burrow out here
that was a meaty tackle
missing yanda but we knew he was going to retire eventually hopefully tyre steps up his game or someone else does need better protection
you know the announcers are trash when they compliment the bengals d for keeping them in the game when the ravens d is shutting out the other side
proche looks good so far
was that the theme music from the wire
alex smith is in its a ravens sub but thats still crazy
throbbin for dobbins
dobbins doesnt like to go down dude is a strong runner
why are they still passing so damn much
gumbel called it complete what a terrible announcer
queen is fucking flying
can we start a gofundme for a cannon we can launch roman out of these play calls are beyond pathetic all season
we should have more than 17 damn points
lamar is playing awful but luckily our defense is playing lights out that we are still blowing them out
up by 17 and lamars on pace for 50 passes go roman go
god damn our defense is playing lights out though arent they
and yall wonder why greg roman is always bouncing around dudes not very good
defense helping out offense thats what its about
lamars definitely not 100 today luckily we dont need him to turn super saiyan this week
madubuike has impressed me so far
these halftime guys are not watching the game lol
the only thing that made me mad about tucker missing is that its going to fuck up his overall percentage
are any of yall from the flaccocam cameron era we did this all the time back then we went pass heavy against bad teams because the coaches know that in the playoffs thats what its going to come down to lamar is going to have to win games with his arm id rather we have trial runs and error now so were prepared when we need it
can anyone tell me why lamar has 30 pass attempts in a half in a game were up 170
oline is fucking dogshit
bro what is this offense lol
were doing that thing where we dont run again huh
this offense is sad right now no easy throws no one open when lamar is actually getting some time uninspired playcalling and poor execution
people are frustrated because these issues weve been seeing with the ravens have been lingering issues and those issues cost them the game vs a legit playoff contender people are just frustrated because it feels like the ravens havent been playing to their full potential i get that theyre winning but this is still a bit concerning
so theyre just not going to run the ball anymore huh i dont understand the strategy here this team is built to run everything is predicated on the run what is roman doing
lamar threw in the first half as much as he used to throw in an entire game im hoping this is just a plan to get him passing reps since we are still winning games as is
fort shouldve picked that off tbh
mcphee has had a hell of a game
patrickqueen is the second ravens rookie to record a sack ff and fr in a game joining terrell suggs who accomplished the feat three times during his 2003 defensive rookie of the year campaign pmgleason
greg roman got kidnapped by marty mornhinweg and the greg we see before us now is marty disguised as greg
that is what they call holding on
why do i keep saying murray

you fucking tell me
even gumbel doesnt know why hes calling lamar murray
thats the lamar jackson im used to
i think gus killed that guy
i hate injury
lmao at the ref
these announcers are terrible coverage sack he threw incomplete
thats where not having a 1 kills you
like i get were winningbut this is not striking a ton of confidence
i feel bad for burrow honestly
at least the defense is balling out today
our defense really showed up today and they are finally taking qbs down and just touching them lightly
the bengals are literally giving us the game

please capitalize now k thx
greg roman would be the worst head coach in the league has absolutely no poise and composure
how does lamar have 33ish pass attempts with the bengals being scoreless is our passing game this bad
yall need to understand that we dont run because we know we can we need to fix the passing plays
elite dragon passing td
3rd and 3 run twice
lamar bb wtf are u doing
sigh its 3rd and 3 theyre averaging 3 yards per carry lets pass
do boykin and lamar hate each other
well on the bright side we keep the streak of scoring in every quarter this season alive at least until the 4th quarter
what are you doinnnnnnn boykin
boykin is pure trash bench him omg
not a overthrow or a bad route just obvious miscommunication
obvi i would still like to see a turnaround from boykin but frankly i just dont see toughness i dont see a competitor you can see it in the way he holds himself even he holds his arms kinda loose he could be a good player for us if he just had some grit and energy really disappointing waste of physical potential
bruh bench burrow before he gets killed
who the hell is gilchrist
im starting to feel bad for burrow lol
lets see some dobbins action this drive
2424 kc v lv dont know what makes me more angry blowing out a team but still unsatisfied or watching carr keep more composure than the entire ravens organization
ravens defence playing well theres that
lamar lamar lamar
this reminds me of watching 2000 ravens games
this is abysmal playcalling from the offense wtf man
lamar has been so rough today but our defence has been phenomenal
our defense is having so much fun dominating
this isnt about an injury lamar isnt seeing underneath defenders at all this is a reps issue lack of preparedness

those 2 missed practices in a row are looming large rn
humphrey is a god at forcing fumbles
greg roman owes wink a steak dinner for carrying this game
fruit punch
marlo punch
jesus christ humphrey youre a god
god i am glad we paid him
good god marlon
patrick queen has more tds than former teammate joe burrow today
marlon humphrey and forcing fumbles name a more iconic duo

ill wait
marlo for dpoy
name one player in nfl history better at forcing fumbles im completely serious here is there anyone its fucking uncanny
marlon is just nuts
yas queen defense really stepping up rn ahah
wow marlon is talented
what an animal 44
marlo showing again why hes worth the big bucks
best fucking player on the ravens period
bengals laying down at this point
kc is tied with lv at the start of the 4th i think this team is showing to be far less than last years team ended the plus side is that last year the team was also looking bad early almost losing to a duck lead pit in ot
lamar needs to play this game out and a least get td to get some confidence back hope harbs realizes this
cmon lv and phl we need your help
false fucking start hahahaha
false fucking start lol
thats a horrible spot
pussy shit right there
zach taylor trying to polish a turd
rip shutout

1 pm 358 pm
ofc philly misses the field goal ofc
welp philly fucked that for us
glad this shitshow is over good job defense
get rg3ed
lets go eagles
eagles fucked it
some of yall are clearly new fans forreal yall really on suicide watch from that 1st half
harbs get boykin off the fucking field
lamar could lowkey lead the league in picks with all the dropped ones this season
im drunk so ready for any downvotes but fuck me lamar get your shit together
what do people want from roman 55 runs today the way i see it this game is a locked up win why not to try get some live practice with personnel formations and plays they may not be very comfortable with this is how teams grow good passing offenses wont just pop up without the reps

everyone chill out and stop complaining about a 17 point lead spoiled ass sub
lamar was out most of the week he lost a friend he was ill he had a knee injury its been raining and the field is wet

guys lamar regressin

hes younger than joe burrow for fucks sake and his ceiling is phenomenal he threw dart tds good lord
lamar again just not locked in like last year maybe its lamarandrews connection but something is not going the same
burrow spends more time on his back than riley reid
im only worried about lamar because this is the 3rd week he has looked bad and today is objectively his worst regular season performance bad decisions 4 dropped ints straight up not seeing defenders
fuck the browns fuck the steelers and fuck the bengals
anyone else see lamas story looks like a homie of his passed away rip
gannon just said weve always been good at rushing the passerdid he forget to prepare for this game
did hollywood just not pick that up or did he make a business decision there
we leave so many points on the board by trying to constantly force passes when the run game is working
i think lamar is focusing too much on his main targets much like aaron rodgers with davante adams last year
the broadcasting crew sucks no replay on the two incompletions
lamar needs to learn there are other receivers besides andrews and hollywood
peters isnt the same this year or am i just 1st quartet overreacting lol prob the latter
bruh if campbell hit burrows he would of ko him lol
queen was not letting burrow run
they went for fucking 4th instead of kicking for 3 lmao theyre here to beat our ass

lamar throws ropes sidearm my god
hollywood still avoiding hits
someone has to teach hollywood how to run after the catch he always turns his body up field and looks around a bunch
more targets for duv
he blocc he attacc he flip on over to his bacc
3rd time hes called him murray now
anyone else hear murray everytime lamar drops back to pass
i love the color commentator calling him lamar jackson as often as possible like do you hear me lamar jackson
im gonna try to keep a murray count were up to 4 and its the first quarter
this announcer keeps saying murray right
gumbel is drunk lmao
bro lamar is like a foot taller than murray and wears 8 cmon man
he keeps calling llama murray
lamar murray
it is to the point where its going to need a face to camera apology wtf so awkward this is not kyler murray
the other commentator keeps enunciating lamar jackson when he says murray lmao
i dont know why this offense doesnt look as good as last year but lamar is clearly not having as much fun
why wont we run read option this season we were able to freeze so many defenders last year
i love lamar murray
big boi no little boi mandrews
ingram just isnt getting it done guys
murray count 6
lets go baltimore ravens quarterback kyler murray
mandrews means murray to andrews
lol now this dipshit calling him murray is a part of the td highlight
kyler jacksons team up 70 against the jets
oh god cbs just showed kyler murray on screen gumbel is screwed now
okay d lets get murray back on the field
stop calling him murray you idiot
this is why marcus murray peters plays so far off receivers
still calling him murray this out out of control
peters has that ed reed style instinct hes not quite as rangey but hes got the same knack for knowing where the ball is going and putting himself into the perfect position even when its not his assignment

both are notorious for film study which owes a lot of it
i think that is the 7th time he has called him murray
how is he still calling him murray is he trolling us
i know hes not a safety but marcus peters really reminds me of ed reed dont you dare throw a sloppy pass anywhere near him
does gumbel have memory issues for real
all murray and no murray makes murray a murray murray
why the hell hasnt someone told gumble yet
damn i wanted to get 17 before the 2nd quarter
a man who expressed his frustration at only being a 3rd down player commits a penalty on first down for 15 maybe your coaches were right
the bengals feeling how we did watching kelce vs us literally unstoppable right now
thank you dunlap for that dumb rtp taking the heat off our bad read options this year
mandrews getting alot of action so far this game this season even i think he will pass his 10 tds from last year
not gonna lie that call was soft
lamar to mandrews is lethal
murray troll aside

make duvernay a starter he already looks so much better than boykin

conventional football theory says we need a tall outside receiver well fuck that just start our play makers who also have the best hands makes sense to me
calling lamar murray is starting to get a little disrespectful how do you forget the mvps last name
this game will feature rg3 in mop up duty
a grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says hey we have a drink named after you

the grasshopper says you have a drink called murray
what a sexy throw by murray
of course hollywood gets a td when i finally give up and sit him on the bench
ngl bakers a pretty good actor xd
has hollywood got maryland flag gloves on
missed sack by judon
bro thats holding you cant block someone in the back wtf
queen ff and recovery what a beast
fumble recovered by patrick murray
life uh finds a way
queen is a monster
judon for jj str8 up
droy
mental built by taco bell
judon playing 8d chess with getting better field position there
jesus burrow has zero protection lmao
queen got enough to brag about on the stat sheet in just one play
holy shit he forced and recovered the fumble
nice job not ripping his spine out unnecessarily i know they were teammates but that takes restraint
queens speed is ridiculous
queen has been balling recently
welcome to the nfl
burrow might actual get killed by the steelers
we threw 4 times in a row what the fuck is romans deal
whatever happened to fake hand offs to ingram and then lamar running for 10 every time
im really not liking what im seeing from lamars passing recently not sure whats up but he seems more off than usual
these announcers are beyond annoying today
im trying not to be too pessimistic but this team looks so unimpressive every week despite winning easily every week except 1 last year they absolutely dominated every week this year the scoreboard says theyre dominating but it doesnt feel like it
i feel kinda bad for burrow tbh this isnt even fair
this is the worst oline
burrows welcome to the afcn
i thought our line struggles
if only i wasnt playing against ravens dst this week lol

s of course happy watching bungles get smashed even at the cost of my fantasy team
joe getting abused back there and the first half isnt even over lol
i want duv and hollywood to have a game against the steelers that secondary looks super suspect lmao
lamar wtf dont just lob it up like that
smh line
wtf is going on theyve had a lot of free rushers the last few drives
what in the hell was that throw
greg needs to do some soul searching
thats the 4th or 5th time today thats no one has even chipped the outside rusher
pay bowser and let judon walk
burrows hard count hurting his team more than helping lol
run d is back baby
now that was a good throw lamar
so is greg roman using this game as practice to work on pass plays

why do we have so many pass attempts up by 17 lol
wtf was that lamar one of the worst passes ive ever seen from him
good lord jackson and accuracy do not belong together today
dobbins 2 10 yard runsthen pass pass horrific pass what the fuck is this ive turned on roman
if im the bengals im just handing to mixon three times and punting burrows going to
die
raiders came back wtf
tucker 69 yarder plz
that was some excellent clock management
i think we should be up by way more if lamar was on his agame
score should be much higher but our offense feels so awkward
damn jt

still the best kicker tho dw about it
cant blame tucker for a 61 yard miss few can manage that
god straight up hated on tuckers kick because hes jealous
i blame god for tucker missing that kick
lamar has never had a worse half than that one from an interceptable pass standpoint 3 clear cut ones another that couldve been charted as interceptable 1 was intercepted 2 happened on b2b plays

missed practice time might be a reason for this inaccuracy is 1 thing throwing the ball right to defenders he doesnt normally do that
there have been a lot of interceptable passes by lamar in this game
every ingram run is under 4 yardwhen was his last good run
offense looks confused as fuck
our route concepts are h o r r i b l e
watson commercial is cringey
game mvp is gonna be a tossup between queen bowser and mcphee
the lack of plays under center is highly concerning im honestly tired of seeing do many plays from the gun sigh
what happened to roman he lost a lot of urgency when play calling the offense is really just lethargic and doesnt seem to care
chase claypool with 3 tds so far why do the steelers always nail their wr picks while we wind up with people like boykin
our db have looked way better blitzing without earl
wink calling a really good game
run ball plz gus bus dobbins plz d
this is the worst ive ever felt while winning 170 offence looks dreadful today
who the fuck is murray
how the hell does this commentator have a job
hes become self aware
that might have been lamars most impressive play of the season
i miss u yanda
ingram looks completely cooked this year please have dobbins starting moving forward
hollywood with 20 yac love to see it
imagine if marquise was a dog like his cousin and took defenders on every run he would be so fucking good
baker mayfield might have the biggest ad campaign in sports history
lamar really needs to start playing better if we want to make it far this season think hes just in a little rut rn
defense playing greatbut i just checked dvoa and bengals are rank 21 run defense and our main 2 backs have been trash this definitely isnt a good sign going forward this is deeper than coaches wont run the ball
throws incompletion

well thats a coverage sack right there
those plays are where lamar used to just take it up the middle but he isnt doing it anymore i dont understand
okay can we legit fire gro after this game his game plan is dogshit even with the score the way it is our defense is playing amazing today and we should have way more than 17 on the bungles

its like dobbins and gus dont exist
aj green contemplating retirement in real time on sideline
that looked straight out of madden
people focusing so much on how our offense is playing like shit but not on how phenomenal our defense is playing against the bengals who have had a decent offense this season
isnt it a penalty to hit the ball out of bounds like the rb did
lmao the punting team really be saying lets go after each punt were like at the 30bruh
i love marcus peters playmaker central whos always bringing the energy and fire every game
running is working too well we must stop immediately
it truly is incredible how efficient we are when we run romans playcalling has been so puzzling this year
well guys i guess ingram sucks right guys in this thread
i think this proves what many of us have been saying

our offense could have gone to this dominant run game at any point today its our bread and butter and we know it works

lets work on our passing game while we are up 17
fuck you boykin
the passing game is shit today
boykin quitting on another route
if boykin kept running while getting held right there he probably couldve got a call instead he gives up
greg roman sucks soooo much with our offense this year
someone tell judon there is no franchise tag bonus for jumping off sides multiple times a game
you guys are killing me on here appears to me lamar isnt close to 100 impacts the game a lot
burrow has been sacked approximately 83 times this game alone poor guy
our dbs have 4 sacks wtf
lmao i feel like everyone on this team got a sack today except for judon
you have to throw to the purple jerseys lamar
lamar
dude what is lamar doing
good thing the bengals cant catch ints lol
lamar bud you gotta do better
is lamar looking before he throws pr is he just saying fuck it dude hasnt looked good in a minute
its fucking raining and a 200 game in the fourth why are you throwing on 1st down
weve had like three near picks jackson needs to play sharper than this
why are we throwing the ball so damn much
lamar was walking odd at the end of that play i really dont think hes healthy
the fact we arent going for it on 4th and 2 with how our defense is playing today says a lot about how bad the offense is playing
lamars week 5 stats are terrible two weeks in a row lol
marlon strikes yet again
marlooooo
humph is one of the best cbs in this league and needs to be respected
fourty fucking four you beauty
fruit punch scooped up by queen this d is lethal
fruit punch
yaaaaaaaaaasss queeeeeeeeen
humphrey player of the game
marlon is chefs kiss
marlon the goatttttttt
good ball extraction
fruit punch
fruit punch
marlon the extractor
big brain thinking from the defense dont have to hold your breath for the offense if they never even get the ball
marrrrrrrrlooooo
does marlon have a turnover in every game this season so far
humphrey doing some leonardodicaprio inception type extraction
marlon dpoy and queen droy
queen for droy
okay lets hit burrow some more now still not satisfied man im still frustrated from the previous weeks
please hand pittsburgh a loss
i wonder how much corona the beer company has been hurt by coronavirus lol like i would love to know if theyve faced any challenges solely due to their name
mp juiceman queen campbell humphrey defence has a bright future
why are so many kickers kissing extra points really raiders against kc
basically harbs wanted a very long timeoutd is prolly gassed after than fumble return
one punch marlon
wow hes actually apologizing lol
campbell got the tackle through the olineman
damn i guess were not getting the shutout
dont let them scooooorrre
remember when we couldnt catch a break against the bengals
we couldnt beat them to save our lives
thats a generous spot
i agree with gannon give burrow the chance to pass
raiders are impressive as fuck
gave up the shutout defense in shambles s
59 minute shutout

fugggggg
pussy ass fg pathetic
so they did get rg3d
go raiders
the eagles suck and are 68m over the cap next year with 44 players under contract yikes
nice so judon has missed a sack and nullified our interception on this drive hes lucky he just got bailed out by queen
judon is like a mediocre blowjob im not mad that hes on the team but he sucks and doesnt get close to the sack
bad pass if the pass is on point thats a big gain or potentially 6
man these threads are cringy its like people expect a touchdown on every drive we are beating a division opponent 170 and we are about to get the ball
we can be enjoying success and still be critical of players and coaches smd with all this spoiled shit you think harbaugh is satisfied with how the offense has looked i really doubt it
unpopular opinion

greg roman has called a good game so far
cutboykin

fire roman

tbh we all know it dudes made awful calls all season losing to kc would be understandable but we couldve had a shot if we werent so horrifically outcoached aside from the o line romans the biggest liability and everyone knows it

bengals fan coming in peace is it normal for commentators to call lamar jackson murray
ok we dont have the worst offensive line lmao
judon is the new subreddit punching bag for the defense
what a crisp offensive performance all around
this is not a sb winning offense
run run run
heres to a good game day with no injuries on either side friends caw caw
hey guys im doing a short research survey for school and would greatly appreciate it if you could complete this only 8 questions
i hope the offense can get it going early in this one
actually great play by judon
that punt sketched me out more than it needed to
judons gonna get 4 sacks this game and use it to leverage
welp looks like ima be watching this game from the toilet had some chicken enchiladas and a bean burrito for lunch
roman reads ravens sub reddit confirmed
duvernay was open
ill take points to start the game while getting the ball to start the 2nd half
tucker goin for a perfect season
shit drive despite the duvernay end around but ill take it good to get points on the first drive
sometimes you take the easy play plus that looked like duv who wouldve had room to run cmon lamar
anyone else pay extra attention to tuckers motion after that post yesterday
this may not be a popular opinion but im happy we have been a little pass happy in these games come playoffs or against elite teams it needs to be something we can do
feel like snead was open but lamar tried to force it to hollywood in double coverage then duvernay was open but lamar tried to force it to andrews in double coverage
how did he possibly gain yards
burrow looking almost lamaresque there
seeing campbell sprinting at you
should have been a easy sack and punt now we gotta worry about giving up the 4th down

oof boyd couldve had that queen is faaaaast
imagine if duv took it all the way on that 40 yard run
nice job by queen to make him throw
rookie qb suspect oline a good day for our dline

but you gotta finish these tackles lmao
ravens 4th down attempts bungholes 4th down attempts
thank god for queen cause that wouldve been an easy first
i get hes small but you gotta actually try to get some yards
hollywood is soft
lamars really off on his throws this year
duvernay plz be our wr1
holy crap he actually threw it to duv
murray
who the fuck is murray
murray again dude
who is murray
not a ravens fan can anyone tell me when lamar jackson changed his last name
how tf you announce an nfl game and not know the name of last years unanimous mvp
murray
greg gumbel is getting on my nerves how does a producer not say anything
gumbel is a fucking moron
lamars pocket poise on that 3rd and 14 was absolutely fantastic his patience allowed andrews to get open
im surprised were taking our time im not convinced that was clearly a first
murrayyy
did this bitch say murray again
fuck it lamar murray for mvp
murray count 5
murray murray murray murray murray

how is a producer or rich not correcting him
lamar just casually telling harbs whats up
for fucks sake gumbal is making me miss the foutseagle booth and thats saying something
i can already see the lamar murray player of the game posts
also dpi and holding like fuck
murray to andrews
how is this guy still saying murray how has no one on the broadcast team said something
murray with a td on his second drive glad we signed the guy
that was def defensive holding but andrews a beast
touchdown baltimore murrays
whos better lamar murray or lamar jackson
idk how hard it is to say jackson
touchdown
thats a full grown mandrews
greg roman lets abandon the run now we have a 10 point lead
guys when are we gonna pay kyler for throwing these tds to mandrews all the way from arizona
interception by marcus murray
someone fire gumbel at halftime please or have a producer at least correct him
murray again wtf
how has there not been someone yelling in gumbels headset about calling him murray
can this ancient fuck not hear the other commentator calling him lamar jackson every time
marcus peters interception marks the 18th straight game that the ravens have forced a turnover the longest active streak in the nfl during that streak peters has had five interceptions and one fumble recovery
7 murrays
that call was soft as hell lmao
flacco in for jets
who the fuck is murray
that was a super soft call
looks like andrews brought his hands today
pretty weak call but i guess well take it
been a while since ive seen a team implode before the end of the first quarter
mandrews is just unstoppable sometimes
having mandrews on fantasy
i think gumble has a bet with gannon for how many times he can slip murray into the broadcast like that meow scene from super troopers
its great that andrews is balling the fuck out today but we need to target someone else man were fortunate enough the bengals are still the bengals but real teams are going to play better on andrews we need everyone to be a weapon like mahomes makes everyone a weapon
okay on one hand im happy he said lamar jackson for once but on the other hand you dont get to call him murray seven times and not address it with a my bad
it still blows my mind how murray was elected the unanimous mvp in his rookie season
lamar murray and justin kicker looking real solid there
how has nobody corrected his boomer ass yet
touchdown marques murray murray to murray baby
hey look hollywood got his first td of the year nice

also fuckin rocket he caught like it was nothing
yo hollywood helmet looks like hes a dj with a ridiculous sized helmet
yikes tucker flirting with that left upright today
meet the ravens we got
lamar murray
mark kamara
aerial andrews
and justin kicker
damn that kyler jackson guy on the cardinals is looking pretty good out there they got the lead on an elite qb up in ny
tucker is flirting with the posts lol why did we install those damn side scoreboards
kyler murray will be the mvp frontrunner by the end of the game
i swear judons been bathing in butter before every game this season
stop showing chiefs highlights i still have ptsd
file that under the judon can only get pressure against tes group
elliot dancing
patrick queen is such a beast
my queeeeen
my god queen that hurt me
lsu on lsu crime
hahahhaaha thats his old qb
burrow having a rough day
im getting a queen jersey
if queen can get better in coverage hell be a beast i cant wait to see him develop
i love queen lmao
queeeeeeen
was just about to be really mad at judon but we got an even better result thanks to the queen
queen for president 2020
the hit and recovery
burrow looks rattled 3 turnovers already obviously one didnt count
you know deep down thats gotta feel great to wallop your old qb teammate
hes living on burrowed time

x200b

sorry
havent seen tiger on tiger crime like that since yesterday when mizzou beat lsu
welcome to the league rookie
the energy by the defense rn
were annihilating burrow damn
probably felt like lsu practice again for queen
nothing like having a pick taken away only to get a sack fumble the next play that gives a better starting position
first game burrow has looked like a rookie lets go flock
glad for us but damn bengals really need to invest in protecting burrow beef up the line and help him learn how to protect himself he is getting fucking wrecked rn
its amazing how we always draft elite lbs
burrow looks like me trying to grow a beard at 17
it was tipped my babies
sigh another 3 pass drive roman
whats with these underneath routes whats the point of a route that not past the first down market on 3rd down
why dont we run the ball more
wtf was that
come on how can you waste that turnover
like going for it but not the play call
he was open
greg roman is back and here to stay baby
also lamar needs to learn to target people not named andrews or brown once in a while
theres been too many times this year that ive been unimpressed with lamar its like hes reverted
hes been over shooting quite a bit needs to turn it down a notch
lamar gotta work on his accuracy been off all season on those throws
everyone calm down these plays are on lamar when he hits them roman looks like a genius we are still 46 on 4th and up by 17
lol how are people mad at roman he called a play that should have resulted in a score or at least a huge gain and lamar missed a wide open andrews
omg bengals line trash af
bengals oline is horrible because our pass rush looks fantastic lmao
the bengals line is so trash
pls eagles
that honest thief movie i just saw a trailer for looks like someone smashed together the scripts for every single liam neesen movie and this is what resulted from it
2 running plays in a row madness
gus bus has that sweet gold mouth piece haha
mekari looks pretty decent at guard
not a good throw lamar cmon now
what the hell is wrong with murray
omg just give it to gus its not hard
i really feel like we should trade one of our rbs they have way more value then the amount we use them like gus gus could be a solid rb1 for a lot of teams and we should take advantage of that if we use him as our rb3
what the fuck was the protection on that drive not good enough oline
have we run even one read option yet
why dont we use jk we spent a second round pick on this guy
bengals oline is trash
defense doing its job at least
i sometimes miss the excitement and heart burn we had before 2019
defense has been amazing so far really liking what im seeing from queen and bowser in particular
that wire intro song
diggin the subtle wire theme thrown in there
jackson is inches from some of these throws being lights out
gets saved from a pick only to throw another pick
even if the defender wasnt there that was a terrible pass that wasnt catchable hell bounce back
second time today the offense ruins a great play by a rookie first duv next dobbins
queen is going to be a better linebacker for us than mosley fight me
someone rushing the punter went down and grabbed his knee who was it
yeah this is just sad at this point poor burrow
the biggest flaw in lamars game is his composure you can tell when hes frustrated and it affects his play and decision making calm down
someone tell roman to give it to dobbins
everyone chill on lamar a bit hes just having an average game that ball to hollywood was on the money the safety just made a good play
im starting to really have doubts on greg roman as an oc maybe its too early but this playcalling is horrid
this just doesnt feel like the same offense at all i get losing yanda was huge and that offenses evolve over time but honestly this just doesnt seem right at all i think roman is responsible for a lot of the blame here
lamar is lucky this defense is playing really good hes not having the best day
the raiders might beat the chiefs
beautiful outside throw there
i wanna see us go the length of the field and score 6
damn nice try plenty of leg just a bit too much hook
what a weird half of football
i know the bengals have a solid dl but there have been multiple times they have absolutely dominated in pass situations ol still suspect in the pass game
what is up with pit finding wr gems
comeback player of the year alex smith
madubuike giving the dline a nice spark today
ingram needs to be 2nd or 3rd rb

dobbins and gus having good game ravens coaching staff hold my beer lets send ingram in
dude what the fuck kind of routes are we running where after 5 seconds no one is open
what is up with lamar not running at all this game
run play followed by two plays with long developing routes wtf roman can you have one of these mfers run a slant
so are we just never going to run he football again

i know im not an nfl coach but i seriously question our play calling this year it doesnt make any sense
defence hard carrying offence right now
idk if lamar is 100 guys im scared
deshon
good lord they are just letting burrow get murdered back there
joker szn
im the joker babyyyy
joker szn
lamar has to get something going now get some more points on the board
the d is absolutely winning the game for us
wtf the special teams shouting bout lol yall just punted
idk how we rolled into this season with the same group of wrs clearly they were an issue last year they had too much confidence in boykin going into this year
oh my god you think this is bad the jags just derped the every loving derp on a 4th and 1 link up allen robinson in the qb slot move minchew to the slot robinson tries to throw fumbles the ball shifting it to his throwing hands houston recovers
horsecollar much
jesus christ self aware now about the murray
murray holy shit who gave this guy a job
his name is not murray
finally gumbel
why do i keep saying murray
this is a minor gripe but they need the announcing booths to get younger there are too many senile old dudes with rocks for brains trying to make coherent sentences
that absolutely was not a hold
gumbel at least finally knows hes doing it
hollywood
action jackson to hollywood
33 passes thats too much for this early in the 3rd man i really dont get it
im sorry its the middle of the 3rd quarter in a game were winning 170 and lamar has 35 passing attempts what the fuck are we calling
fuck it sign ab
im starting to wonder if theyre purposely abusing the pass to run ratio to make up for missed reps shit just doesnt make sense otherwise to not be running the ball
i miss seeing this type of pressure its so fun to watch
i honestly think eventually to win a sb we gonna have to move on from roman eventually every offense he coaches starts out hot in the first year then after a few seasons starts choking and being sub par
all things considered its been fun watching the defense dominate ill take a stinker on o every now and then if it means i get to watch us bully offenses again
i dont know why ingram gets so much hate here dudes still got it and brings a great energy to the locker room
lets go eagles
wait running the ball works
lots of complaining in here today anybody else feel like theyre telling lamar to save his legs until we need em were not going to lose this gamemight as well keep him fresh until we need all of his tools against the chiefs steelers etc plus he gets to develop the passing game more feels like a long game approach to me hopefully
where are those dudes shitting on ingram earlier
lots of bad mouthing of mark here he still got legs yall we just need to use him gus and jk more
we need a passing oc lmao greg is great on the run but he is so out of his element when it comes to a complete package
lamars judgement is shit
boykin needs to be benched until he proves that he is going to give any effort
what the fuck was that
boykin blocking lmao
boykin breaks my heart
boykin soft as hell
gotta start putting our fastest guys out there on 3rd down
harbaugh went over to see if lamar was drunk
was boykin run blocking
i love that mo is still highlighted on the field
fuck these announcers and fuck the bengals
judontrash
judon getting flagged again
our defense has been looking good our run game is working when we use it were just struggling in the pass game lamar definately seems off
car vending machines what a breakthrough that was
why arent we running the read option this year last yea the entire offense revolved around it are they trying to keep lamar from taking the hits
bench boykin
roman be like
welcome the division joe
joe will be andrew luck v2 if this keeps up for him
20 points against the bengals is just mediocre
our blitzes are working in this game because burrow their pass pro have no idea how to counter them burrow hasnt seen at least 5 of them

rookie qb rookie struggles

the same time this changes nothing as far as blitz usage against teams like the chiefs cant do it against them
jackson wtf man
run the fucking ball for god sake
it is 200 run the damn ball
lamar must be playing hurt
lamar has 0 touch today none everything is like drives

he can drill some awesome side arms he needs to figure out deeper and touch passes better
i know jackson may not appreciate the running back comments but maybe just let him run a few times nothing else has worked
bowser and ferguson are looking good
this defense is keeping me interested lmao
god i love patrick queen
im not too worried about lamar dude had a knee injury and its obviously affected him hoping it wont be affecting him next week or after
that fruit punch is lethal
patrick queen player of the game today in my opinion
marlon mf humphrey
froot punch
first td of the second half
no wonder the bills struggled with roman as a oc guy does not know when to run and when to pass up 20 why not run the ball with jk or gus

and the raiders are keeping up with the chiefs this is beyond frustrating

reminds me of cameron
humphrey is da man
hump is so good
im sorry but its no longer the peanut punch fruit punch for life
dpoy and droy
why they keep targeting my boi
why is marlon targeted so much tho
best defense ever n the league
defense can easily carry us here but it wont be able to against a good experienced qb this offense needs serious work this week
imagine humphrey in mma lol dude was made for it
when are these marlon jerseys going to be back in stock i need to get one
our first round picks these last 5 years have been amazing stanley humphrey lamar hollywood and queen

im going to intentionally ignore hurst
bengals try to prevent a shutout then marlon goes nah
magic marlo
pat queen 1 sack 1 ff 1 fr 1 td
of course this is the week im going against the ravens d in fantasy
give humphrey that mahomes money
cmon philly philly
cmon iggles
fly eagles fly
steelers defense giving up 30 to eagles lol
harbaugh let them have this man
alex smith has been sacked 5 times on 18 dropbacks get him outta there
why the fuck did that replay just take 5 minutes
bout time he apologized
im feeling bad for the d they been out there a long time some warriors man
i keep hearing an annoyingly pitched ooooohhhhhhhh the whole game its so fucking annoying
if they cant convert this
iggles making a move
wow raiders with a massive play
watching igglesstillers now

leggo philly
mmm my baltimore defense in fantasy is v v sexy
rip shutout
not a shutout give me my blame of the game thread
so greg roman passing here s
come on eagles
if season ended today humphrey would have a good case for dpoty queen droty
burrow missing queen a lot lol
people focusing on how bad our offense is which is understandable but not on how our defense is having one of the best performances you could possibly have
lmfao the steelers struggling against the eagles
three straight passes roman you fucking idiot
literally a record breaking running game last season

roman nah fuck that shit that was stupid lets not do that again

fuck off greg
jesus christ lamar literally misses every single deep pass
alright lamar is way off he never does that

missed practice time maybe
damn lamar had a gaping hole on the left side for an easy first i wonder if he is looking to pass almost too much now lol
its 61 yards guys dont be too broken about missing that
we dont need to run the ball we are gonna beat the bengals work on the passing game so we can actually comoete against good teams
people are talking about judon earning a contract bruh he should be competing for a roster spot at this point
nice to see judon making an impact on the game s
why does it feel like were losing
bad challenge but who cares
what is that little patch on calais jersey ive noticed it before on others looks like a caped superhero or something
i like it when people add an s to random names

humphreys burrows buddensim going to start new ones ngatas flaccos madabuikes wentzs gostkowskis
ugly ass win but still a w
brown returning a kick interesting since hes afraid to even look at a defender lol
a convincing victory for the ravens

convincing of what exactly lol
we fans were totally spoiled from last season lol i often forget about games where wed score like single digits the entire game
stop making excuses lol this offense is awful right now
this is the worst commentator i have ever heard
greg roman strikes again
idk if im watching a different game than some of you guys but the run game has gone nowhere today the fact is its both unsustainable to have as much running success as we did last year and losing yanda means were just not built to do as well as last year
jeez youd think the bengals are blowing us out this game from the comments

no its not lamars best game but chill please
we should sign julio they are losing 207 to fucking carolina
yeah the ravens are up 170 against the bengals but the offense and the playcalling were simply sluggish in the 2nd quarter so many uninspired pass plays the right side of the offensive line is still struggling without yanda and lamar jackson has been inconsistent with his precision and touch today it really felt like they wasted a good 3 drives by not scoring anything even if they are playing a young bengals team that is at least 2 years from being competitive

look theres no reason why baltimore should be passing the football 29 times while only running it 13 times in one half that isnt the teams forte with only two consistent targets in the passing game
lamar looks bad today
boykin provides 0 to this offensei hate how we keep trying to turn shit into diamonds
brown has left like 15 yards on the field already
fire roman now
how are we not absolutely running up the score against these jobbers is anyone else starting to get concerned about our offence
the bengals have a bad defense and we still look like this i thought roman was to blame but im putting equal disappointment in lamar big time
are the browns actually good and we just made them look bad
pls colts and pls eagles
no pass rush needs to get fixed today time to turn it on judon and co
flacco is out there
we better get a lot of sacks on these ass tackles
proche was right to let that bounce but it was still scary nonetheless
the ol chris moore special but done right
fuck yes duvernay thats what i want to see from this offenseplaycalling
free duvernay
bozeman with a beautiful seal on that duv run

extend that man this offseason
anyone else see brown wide open
damn missed an opportunity with duvernay
passing game was supposed to improve this year so far its been the same or worst
boykin you can come in at the redzone otherwise i want duv
lamar locking in on andrews again
that playcall on 3rd and 7 was actually good lamar just surprisingly made the wrong read mightve made the wrong read on 1st down as well

gotta look to players other than andrews and hollywood theyre being keyed in on
lamar always gotta be going for big plays just get the 1st down had a wide open receiver underneath
aww mo next to trey
how is someone always open like that
tyler boyd always gives me ptsd
i remember when we had a good pass rush
pass rush doesnt get blocked and still cant get a sack
if youre going to run that play you actually need you know blockers
hollywood is scared to get hit im over it
dumb play brown is scared of contact
markus brown
mediocretobad playcalling and lamars decisionmaking hasnt helped matters
run the ball greg you absolute scrotum
he flip
we want dobbins
why does this announcer keep calling jackson murray
someone tell the announcer that this is the other black qb i guess jesus
marks andrews goes weeeeee when anybody else would be freaking out or injured in that position
back to back pass plays wtf are you doing roman
why the fuck is gus edwards lined up out wide
how is the offense this bad against the fucking bengals
murray on the move again
again murray
murray counter 3
damn 1010 on the flip 1010 on the slide
murray counter 5
murray 4
how has the other announcer not covered his mic and been like this is lamar fucking jackson get his name right
mandrews
murray to andrews
murray for 6
mandrews carried the whole drive lmao
touchdown lamar murray
is greg gumbel a kyler murray fanatic
murray to andrews for the td
mandrews coming up big wow
mandrews is hot
idk what everyone is thinking but this might be the best quarter of football ive seen this team play this season well done boys
mark andrews is the only player allowed to catch td passes this season
some one tell the other commentator its murray not lamar jackson smh newbs
kyler murray to mark andrews for the td what a great pickup by the ravens definitely needed at the qb position
someone needs to be on the play clock next drive that was close again but beautiful throw to andrews also that was blatant pi
that was a really nice play by lamar
lamar jackson and kyler murray did the fusion dance this weekend you guys havent heard obviously gumble has
fuck the new jake from state farm

all my homies hate the new jake from state farm
lamar murrays knee probably bothering him a little too
happy for the td not a fan of a few of lamars decisions
that does make me smile
aj green just watched
interception marcus murray with the pick
hell yes pressure interception
murray turning the corner
wow lamar is getting zero yards running outside
how is he still calling him murray
someone tell him its jackson geez
murray again
so thats what having a decent blitz feels huh
murray drops back passes to murray
murray
murray
thats 8 on the murray counter
wtf is all this shit about murray in a ravens thread
is gumbel mixing up lamar with kyler
we gotta push for this ass announcer to get fired and im dead serious
that was kinda weak i wasnt aware of that offsetting penalty rule
we only seem to be doing one designed run with lamar jackson and its just not really working need to get more creative
dunlap is a clown
sometimes it looks like jacksons passes actually get lift like theyre on a flat trajectory and the after about midway rise up
think we should trade the saints for latavius murray maybe kick the tires on demarco murray
marc andrews is doing great so far
how about another joke murray

thats all i can think of when greg gumbel calls lamar jackson murray
mandrews is about 2 years from being my all time favorite ravens tight end heap has the nostalgia but god hes a beast
touchdown marquise murray
just talking about andrews now our boy hollywood getting it going
murry to hollywood
hollywood
they mustve told gumble during the commercial that its jackson
hollywood fitzgerald
nice catch by steve smith jr
so much for hollywood not having a td
finally hollywood gets a td
gonna be another blowout
credit to the bengals they have focused on the run and have done a good job problem is they listened to the pundits about whether lamar could throw or not
lamar murray to antonio brown for his first td of the year
18 straight quarters with a score
jesus judon really does suck
murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray murray
so many missed sacks
i was about to say judon won his one on onethen i realized it was against a teand still didnt finish
ferguson is really getting better at setting the edge
ferguson looking good today too what is going on
quickly growing tired of judon
god dammit judon
it kills me that we could have signed clowney if we just let judon walk
wink feast on rookies
killa queen
queen fucking rocked him
patrick queen
judon

facepalm
yasssssss queeeeewwn
lowkey feel bad for burrow why draft a qb with a high school oline
killer queen has no weaknesses
you can tell that shit was personal too lmao he didnt even attempt to wrap him up straight up old school pop
rip joe
the balls is ours bitch
that hit from queen was disgusting sheesh
damn queen with the triple crown sack ff and fr
i really dont get the hype behind judon the only time he wins his matchups is when hes either unblocked or on a tight end that coupled with all his stupid penalties makes him not worth the huge extension he wants
what was that throw did it get tipped
is it me or is seeing other qbs in the afc north getting hit by us pretty cool
baltimore ravens world renowned passing attack
ah yes a 1yard pass to nick boyle on 3rd and 7
i hate this playcalling
but why lamar
damn lamar gets too excited on those
is there a reason we arent running the ball
ahh lamar had him easily
was that a gro call or a harbaugh call cause wtf
i feel like i just watched myself playing madden going for it on 4th and 6 while up 17 isquestionable to say the least
honestly what the fuck happened to lamars accuracy beyond 10 yds
not impressed with the passing game its like we are running random plays instead for running offense and where is the running game we are up 17 run the ball and throw off playaction
baltimore is a running based team

greg roman that means pass it right
were getting cute dammit
literally any time this team gets an offensive penalty roman refuses to run it every 1st and 15 so far this year had passes
zero complaints with the defense today we are murdering their offensive line
cincinnatis oline is awful
burrow is a millionaire but i do not envy him on this day

edit current millionaire
burrow is getting hit left and right lmao
so rich tell me more about field position
another sack this is confusing
burrow hasnt played like a rookie all year up until this game feels good to see the defense finally he the ones to shut him down
this is not a hold the ball for 5 seconds before you throw it kind of oline
hey guess what i still like the call to go for it
nice rush by bowser
iggles tie the steelers the steelers d is definitely overrated
burrow should have pulled a eli
gus is so good
start the bus
lamar what the hell were you thinking with that
lamar that shit has to be out of bounds jesus christ
can we pls start giving it to dobbins more often
nice job roman keep passing asshole
gus wasnt this good last year right i remember getting frustrated at him a few games last year idk

his improvement has been crazyyy
look at morgan cox bringing returners down
can we like run more were we not the best run offense of all time statistically
wasted possession
our offense looks so stale cmon guys this bengals d is bad to say the least
we were running good on that driveuntil we stopped running wtf greg your fucking things up
burrow is seeing purple ghosts out there
i love that wink knows the blitz is a cincy weakness and just continues to put that pressure on
were a little dreary in here so can we notice our run defense seems to be legit again after being pretty mediocre for a while
i need at least 3 on this drive thank you
hell of a run
honestly im glad they arent running we could be up by another 20 by running probably but that isnt going to help us come play offs weve seen how bad the game gets when teams take away our running and that is going to happen during the play offs we need to get our passing game going obviously its not going great but we should use these games to develop it rather than just win by something we are good at its not good to be one dimensional so its good to use a game like this to develop a deficiency
damn hollywood gotta hold that
holy fucking shit why are we not using jk dobbins hes so fucking good
wtf
jesus christ dude
we have to seriously consider giving dobbins actual carries
and that ball is complete
what a completion by lamar murray
sigh roman lamar oline
decision making lamar looking rough out there at times
just run the fucking ball
we need lamar back idk who this murray guy qbing is
is burrow going to die out there
holy fuck bruh can we please rush the ball god damn roman
fuck you greg roman you asshole
hand it off to dobins and edwards
just give gus the ball the rest of the game this is sad
4th interceptable pass of the game for lamar 3rd one right to the defender he has never had a game this bad in this respect

he isnt seeing the field at all
mcphee is having an awesome game
i get the whole point of passing up 17 is to build lamars confidence but what the fuck
who the hell was lamar throwing that to
this 1st half has felt like its dragged on for ages
im really upset we wasted dobbinss little minibeastquake run
queen just erased gio
not the worst day for lamar to have a bad day
apart from andrews and brown we have no other receiving threat and its showing
can someone take these announcers to a retirement home please
the d is carrying us right now the offense better show up
our offensive line is so bad without yanda
i absolutely hate this announcer bengals d has down a great job apparently and joe burrow needs more help can you give the winning team credit for anything
damn bengals called a timeout just to give it up easily
61 here we go
darn
honestly our offense was pretty bad that half
lamars gonna let his hair out and turn this season around you watch
47 yds a pass yikes
with how dominant the defense has been even slightly competent offense wouldve put the ravens up by like 30 points
roman avoids giving dobbins more touches like its a disease
my favorite thing about that half was only 1 play call for lamar to run the ball it needs to be occasional elite weapon not a staple of the o imo
what kind of cheat code wizardry is harbs using to keep his glasses from fogging up with two masks on
lamar has been off since the chiefs game
the other issue seems to be our route concepts always require 3 seconds where are the slants and crossers
orlando having a major slump this year
good to see we made halftime adjustments we obviously needed oh wait no we didnt
man lamar off and our line cant seem to block even for a second
youre up 170 no need to play hero ball deep in your own territory lamar
gotta go young with coordinators eventually
accuracy is off and hes hesitant
boykin stepping up would fix a lot of our offensive issues the only reason we send hollywood on so many deep routes is because hes our only deep threat at receiver if boykin could actually play a deep ball itd open things up for holly and duve underneath to get some serious yac
that pass rush today tho
holy fuck what a hit
i almost feel bad for burrow hes getting brutalized back there
only 4 sacks it feels like way more than that
lol bengals line is the worst ive ever seen
lets get 6 who says no
deshon elliot is one of my favorites he always seems to get some big hits off
im worried about jacksons mobility with this knee thing
please greg run the ball
lamar needs help man hollywood just isnt a true separation wr
remember when we would run the ball for a 9 minute drive
duvernay is fast af and is reliable why tf dont we give it to him more often
we need to give duvernay way more looks
why do i keep saying murray

i dunno cause youre senile
murray strikes again
murrays decision making since the chiefs game has been spotty feel like hes lacking confidence
that holding call was sus
we dont know gumbel we dont know
horrible holding call
man i dont like that holding call hands inside and still driving back
there we go lamar turn tf up
marquise breaking off a piece
holy cow gus just took out reader
someone needs to tell the announcer to lay off the booze before the game
honestly offense looks like absolutely trash
out of the way ref lol
the fact that nobody can get open is pathetic
where is our offense
lamar plz scramble for one one of these damn drives
i wouldve liked to see lamar run to the right there i think it was open
i really dont think lamar is the problem all 3 receivers were stacked in the same spot just 4 8 and 12 yards up field
if our receivers cant get open scheme them open ffs
kinda looks like were not trying feels like practice
this is the worst announcing job ive seen in a long time
shit i forgot aj green even existed
i hate to say it but willie snead should not be the 2nd best wr on any nfl team
lamar could have and should have taken off there he seems to be really hesitant on running this year thats fine and all butuhwe dont exactly have a solid reliable group of wrs yet

use your legs a bit more lamar please i like it when you stunt on hoes with your leg
were in this gam bc of the d our offense needs to get in synch
12 carries by the rb and 2 by wr nice job roman
im newbie can someone explain me why lamar doesnt scramble as often as last year
that route combo on 3rd down was trash as well wrs stacked on top of each other
so good at ball extraction
im liking our defense much better than our offense this year
roman hmmm the passing game didnt work better call another
lamar got to scramble more
does lamar ever take any snaps under center
they look like a pack of wolves tryna get that balli love it
winks play calling has given earl thomas and marcus peters the first sack in their careers exotic
look what happens when we run the ball
lol look at that running the football works xd
hey guys its a run game
wow maybe we should try this running thing more
elite dragon just ran for a first
31st in passing thats all we needed to see folks roman aint it
for real what is wrong with these commentators this guy didnt run all day they just saved this up untill he would finally run didnt they
31st ranked passing attack

also when did roman have hair
what the absolute fuck
that was 3rd down wow
lol what the fuck was that
boykin is like randy moss takes off playsbut none of goat stuff
tucker missed a 61yard fg are we concerned
how is this announcer blaming lamar for that lamar saw a 1 on 1 with no one overtop and a big reciever boykin stopped running his route
a bit disappointed with our offense right now but were winning who cares
the run is working every single time and yet we keep passing please stop
why is judon playing safety on that play
so now announcers are actively cheering for a team as plays unfold lol
i want judon to succeed so much but man every game seems worse
judon offside again
the browns gave up 30 to these guys at home with fans so theres that
man las vegas holding their own against kc
it feels like burrow has been hit every snap
tbh if roman wants a hc job after this season i will do back flips with excitement get em outta here
kinda feel bad for burrow dudes getting killed
our dbs have more sacks than our lbs and linemen
i swear im still hearing that horrible ooooooooooooooooo person from the recorded crowd noise audio
bengals oline flat out cannot handle it
my man humphrey
marlo energy is the best kind of energy
we should be up at least 450 right now with this defensive effort today
time for murray to hand the ball off
hahahaha what the fuck
yea were up 200 but it doesnt look good offense looks horrible passing when we should be running receivers cant really get open not gonna beat anybody with the 31st ranked passing game in the nfl if it wasnt for our defense they would probably be in the game
why do we keep throwing for the love of god stop
just wtf lamar
sigh another pass wtf call a run play
cincy has given up just run the ball
lamar would have legit 5 interceptions in this game if the bengals held on
for the people upset with our offense think about how great the defense is playing and be happy that our offense doesnt have to be playing good for a game like this hopefully this is just a fluke
something is wrong with jackson for sure honestly looks like hes throwing to defenders on purpose sometimes
all these tv shows look like absolute pants jesus christ
lamar been interesting today
what the fuck is going on
greg roman you are a stubborn ass
what the fuck is lamar doing
feels like koch is doing great in the punt game
we need to keep lamar in the game blow out or not
what kind of run call was that shit
they completely neutralizes our passing game
bowser setting the edge real good
im glad were winning but can we just end this already
bengals offense greggrosenthal

7 first downs

7 punts

7 sacks of burrow
7 sacks lol
there has to be something in lamars mental this past off season that has rattled him he looks to be less efficient passing and less elusive running it doesnt look like the ability isnt their looks like a mental block or something i swear if abs awful attifude put a curse or got in his head this summer i wont go there yet just hope things start to click soon
lamar is having a bad game but as an oc your supposed to set him up for success if hes injured why have him throw 40 times with a sub par oline our pass game cannot stand on its own legs so lets throw it despite having one of the worst wr cores in the league
yaaaaaas queen yaaaasssss
this d is fire today
defense playing lights out man
droy patrick queen dont me
offense deserves to walk home after this game
hump is a fucking punching machine
defense has truly been something else today
did marlon strip that holy shit lol
100 million dollar man
marlo and queen
those punches are heat seeking missiles
droty
marlo again with the punch holy shit
fruit punch
fruit punch
marlon peanut tillman humphrey
yasss queen
damn love this d was giving up on this game bc th o is so frustrating to watch but man th d is making this game exciting
love how sizzles impact can be seen in our dbs forcing fumbles 247
ok time to bring in the b team
defense killin it in fantasy today
hell of a play by humprehy
how many knockouts is that this year 4
yassss
genuinely time to begin the marlon for dpoy campaign
dana white boutta gift marlo a ufc contract with that right hook
we are witnessing marlo evolve the cb position
if the d wasnt playing this good id have stopped watching already
marlon with the reach around
it usually takes the offence to take longer to get on the same page this is concerning obviously but lets remember we had 0 preseason games and it took us time to build up momentum on offence stop panicking and lets just hope it improves missing yanda clearly held a massive part and romans calls havent been too great either
mixon is good
run defense has been solid
humph should be a supe in the third season of the boys he punches people into different dimensions
did gumble just say he needs to apologise to cock
the iron cock defense
nooooo theyre gonna score
steelers fumble
one thing i do not miss about the flacco era is constantly getting greg gumbal as our playbyplay
grateful to the bengals for just running this out
man announcers really trying to hype up burrow this game like he didnt panic at all
why is hollywood returning kicks
uhhh can we not have our only competent receiver returning kicks
nothing worse than the field goal at the end of a shutout why not give your offense a shot to hit the end zone people say its job security but i feel like its even more reason to fire the coach
eagles missed the fg ugh
phl is useless
listen some of you are truly spoiled as if the steelers arent struggling against philly right now
what in the fucking world

ok enough need to call it how we see it at this point lamar is playing like absolute ass right now he doesnt even look like the same guy id expect that kind of 3rd down throw from say darnold
is uh anyone else getting concerned by lamars deep ball

please someone tell me it was just a bad throw
those 2 days of missed practice are looking kind of noticeable for lamar
this offense is still great dont get me wrong but they are just inconsistent so far they look stale at times
lamars knee must actually be injured i notice hes actually not running today
our two biggest offensive plays were from duvernay and dobbins who have each touched the ball like twice what in the fuck is roman doing this season
bruh were up 170 in a division game the fact that we blew out the browns as badly as we did was incredible were fine
hollywood couldve gotten another 5 yards there cant be that afraid of contact
we can admit the flacco era was much worse than this but also admit that the offense needs to play better for when we play tougher opponents love being up by 17 but you cant be content when going for a ring
still 200 guys
lamar overthrew boykin that pass was not even close to catchable yeah id like to see him make an effort but that was 100 on lamar
pull lamar and put rgiii in
there you go guys 3rd 2 we ran it and got nothing
sign ab
i love this team but this offense is absolutely disgraceful
steelers d is so overrated
as much as i just want this dumb dreary game to end cant fault harbs for wanting to show his guys he cares and will fight for every inch also doesnt hurt to see who can bring it on 3rd and short
this announcer is such a moron how much time would burrow have with 4 blitzing dumbass
we gave up 3 points this defense is trash

s
wtf lamar what an awful first half by him much worse than the stats
but lamar has me worried now hasnt looked good all season looks like were trying real hard to make him a pocket passer to prove all the doubters that he could not the mans game we need way more run option plays thats how we kill teams when that end dive in on our rb lamar keeps it and kills them keeps defenses stacking the box then we kill them with play action weve gotten away from our identity as an offense
lamar used to be a better passer
worst rush defense in the league pass 75 of the time
this was one of very few times where i disagreed with going for it on 4th bad coaching decision we had an opportunity to pin them deep
everyone here is bashing roman constantly but hes not making these awful throws that miss open receivers
dobbins should be in at rb whenever possible hes more dynamic than ingramgus bus gives lamar another safety valve with mark andrews
roman has to run the ball wtf is this man doing
blatant opinion

every snap that ingram gets over dobbins or edwards is a lost snap
it feels like no one is developing or improving in these games havent learned anything new and lamar isnt looking any better raven games are getting boring i wanna see dobbins get more than 2 carries a game give duvernay and boykin a look

we can beat up on bad teams all day but we need to find good players to help us beat the titans and chiefs
protect lamar jfc

o line is so trash if that knee injury is bad we cant risk him scrambling like that
did snead just give up on the play before the ball was thrown
yall need to chill look at lamars wl record since he became a starter
thats an illegal bat penalty not that the refs know the rules
terrible overthrow what kind of route boykin
flacco with another elite td
im convinced andy reid or bellichick has a voodoo doll of roman only way to explain romans moronic play calls
flacco scrambling for first downs and throws a td

i miss him dont get this twisted
entire defense except judon are players of the game
fire roman clown
roman is frankly an idiot lamar cant throw that but he shouldnt be in the position to have to throw that
this is embarrassing its pretty clear that lamars not 100 today so why do they keep calling pass plays xd
aj green need to tell harbaugh to come get him
these announcers giving lamar lot of credit here he didnt play well today
lamar has had a very pedestrian year so far whats up
please just trade judon already hes so fucking bad
lets gooooooo
mekari starting at rg
i just want a hollywood td today
lol my stream has cincinnati commercials but its working well do i switch or suck it up
spoilers theyre gonna throw screens
look at calais campbell standing there a head taller than the other really large guys
i am not liking these broadcasters they sound like they are falling asleep right now
was that a sack
anyone got the live stream
thats why you play him and not boykin
duvarney got wheels baby
fucking hell that kid is fast
duvernay is fast
what a deceptive toss by lamar
more duvernay please and thank you
duvernay is fast
great play call
duvernay has got some wheels on him
i like that duvernay guy
that blocking on duvs run was fucking perfect he didnt even have to make anyone miss
i wanna see more of the rookies at wr this game lets see what we got
hopefully our line is a lot better with stanley back
thats the play calling i knew roman had just never uses
it felt like lamar threw that too late like that was an anticipation throw
right down middle in tuck we trust
lamar please dont do that all game
we gotta use duv more
bizarre choice by lamar there couldnt see who was cutting open inside but a leading throw there and thats an easy first down
these commentators really try to jynx tuck you could hear the inflection in that fuckers voice trying to cast his gypsy spell
well at least we have tucker
fucking hate when we throw on first dammit
lamars habit of tossing it up to mark cost us there duvernay was open
offense seems to have more energy than the last few weeks lamar seems to want it a little too much hell settle in here
lamar makes bad throws why arent we running

because the guy is going to have to get the passing game going eventually or we are going to be one dimensional
im surprised to see mekari get the start at right guard over dj fluker like is fluker that bad at this point
if we gonna throw on first dont fucking run on second and make it a hard third greg roman is ass on god
teams pick us apart with short throws over the middle we have to throw for 20 every time
does our zone defense just suck it seems like all qbs find gaping holes to hit
i dont think i have ever seen the ravens run zone successfully lol dudes just wide fucking open
im hoping roman gets a head coaching offer next year and leaves im sick or his shit
fucking ass pass rush
how do they have wide open receivers and ours continue to seem smothered
looked to me like they were holding elliot on that or it would have been a sack
lmao slippery mf
this is where you bitch slap a rook
credit where its due nice job escaping by burrow
at least its 4th down but that couldve been a huge gain here
classic get pressure but dont sack
fuck off the field
marquise is so afraid of contact
yeah dont ever call that play again
saw that getting nothing at the start
hollywood making too many business decisions for the level hes at
screen to brown what a stupid play
roman gets too cute early in the game we need confidence building plays early on
as soon as i cast doubt on hollywood lol
hollywoods helmet looks so big on him bobble head
jesus christ all these deep shots havent been getting anything
hollywood needs to bulk up
this is duvernays game i can feel it
we need to get duvernay more involved in the pass game every time i type his name it autocorrects to being in all caps which is my reasoning
duve king
gus bus sighting
duvernay already with more in this game than boykin has for weeks basically
we do a lot of deep passes on 1st down which are always incomplete which leads to another passing play on 2nd and 3rd down which gets away from our strength
also its starting to become apparent these bad team match ups are all about getting lamars arm up and ready
stout defense by the bengals there even though we converted i give them credit
gumble apparently thinks were the cardinals
this offense is so sluggish
andrews with the windmill lmao
andrews landed the best way he could have lol
textbook landing by mandrews
these commentators are gonna make me fall asleep
lamar this year hasnt got anything running to the outside
here comes flip andrews again
that flip was gnarly
3rd and 14 goddamn it
shit commentators
our offense keeps converting despite looking like shite lol
seeing a 65 dude flip like that is something
gumbel has a concussion
stop calling him murray you dumbfuck
why does he keep calling lamar murray
something is wrong with lamar nothing close to a run yet for him
mandrews showed tf up today
omg these announcers blow fucking ass
let gus punch one in
here comes angry llama
wow i didnt realize wed scored in every quarter this year so far thats actually kinda nuts
these announcers have no chemistry its not that what theyre saying is particularly awful but theres no synchronization those long pauses the lack of connection between their calls no playing off of each other whatsoever theyve got nothing its like listening to two people commentating from inside a box where they cant hear the other guy they just have a light that tells them when its their turn to talk
whats up man where is gus
hey gro we do have gus and dobbins you realize right fucking dipshit
how can we not run it in here
we just called a timeout and they didnt go to a commercial thats weird
boiii
great td pass by murray 6 times now
murray counter 6

i think hes having a stroke
maybe we been throwing cause we cant run as well as last year
murray andrews
youd think his partner would correct him nah let him bury himself the color guy says
murray with the touchdown pass
he was holding him all along too lol
dude is gonna lead the league in touchdown receptions this year
dawg mandrews always freaking comes alive in the redzone haha
that was a dart of a pass
still fcking got it
im about to head over to mt and bang on the gate asking to see gumbel tell him
its murray to see him
has dobbins got any touches
lamar better watch out i hear this murray kid is pretty good
mandrews mr reliable
weirdly he only says murray when hes passing but says his name properly otherwise
really clear hold on andrews on the td glad he was able to power through
ingram looks like he fell off a cliff this offseason
murray with the pass and its murray with the catch in the endzone here comes murray on to kick the pat murray with the hold and its good murray
i want a few big hits on burrows give him a real welcome to the afc north
lets gooo juice man
peters with that pick
marcus peters
peters peters you good fam
pass rush satisfactory
mp juiceman
announcers playing the meow game from super troopers with murray
the bengals are getting rg3ed at this rate
i told you burrow would look like a rookie
still murray
idk why but burrow doesnt rub me the wrong way nearly as much as mayfield does hes equally overconfident
mp
murray streak continues
they went to commercial and no one wanted to correct him
penalty is declined by rule is that new
that was a light call
why wouldnt the penalties offset
seeing some good flashes from madabuike
lol its the lamar andrews show today
where would we be without mandrews
lamar finding his stride again patience yall
this man has said murray so many times
you can tell hollywood really wants a td he usually celebrates with andrews on a td but isnt doing that
lamurray
the baltimore murrays are looking good
that murray to andrews connection is fire
hollywood for his first of the year
hollywood
hollywooooooooood
touchdown hollywood
anyone think lamars off this year anyone
no rock paper scissors celebration im sad now
i hate not having a crowd man
kyler now has 9 tds to 1 pick on the year
lamar murray
im sorry ms murray i am fo reeeeal
that murray guy hes good
sooners legend
hollywoods headband is fire
joe mayfield has not looked great
meanwhile flacco is 5 for 8 for 34 yards in the 2nd quarter
so awkward watching flacco hand off to bell
judon feast when hes against tes or unblocked
judon struggles to finish sooo much it is unreal
fucking sack him
im lowkey glad judon didnt get that sack lol
i can already tell imma hate burrow like i do ben with this unsackableness
matthew body built by taco bell so im all greasy and cant get a sack judon
thats on marlon also a good throw
i despise tyler boyd
matthew i suck at getting sacks judon
lmaooooo deshon
fucking judon bum ass
fuck judon are you kidding me
judon is fucking gone
keep em comming joe
here comes the judon love train lol
queennnnn
patrick queen what a play
judon forgiven the fumble was better than the pick
queen
he got hammered
now we know who really carried lsu hahaha
id like to get hit from behind by queen
god i love patrick queen
burrow is going to get himself killed
buddy got blasted lmao
burrow might end up in concussion protocol with how his head snapped
the defense talking a lot of shit today
queen dont give a fuck
better field position than the int anyway
bowser is athletic af
fuck yeah beat his ass
now is the time to stick the dagger into their hearts
tiger on tiger friendly fire
guys i feel bad for burrows
burger queen
you love to see former college teammates involved in plays together especially in their rookie year
but they were teammates
the fuck kinda throw was that
did that get tipped jesus
are you all fucking blind or dumb it was tipped lmao
do willie snead and miles boykin even exist
ive seen a few bad snaps today
man i think receiver had inside leverage down field
mannnnn overthrown
but

but why tho
we got 4 yards after a takeaway lmao
4 passes in row roman wtf are you doing whyd they even go for it at all
whyyyy
i know were up but of these throws are way off
what the fuck was that drive
should have been koch
well that was a sad series

false start typical for us whenever we try to hard count

3rd down with no shot

4th down bad overthrow
its not a bad play call at all if lamar hits its a huge play
play calling looking sus again
last year was the first year i completely had confidence in a ravens offense now that i expect it its so much more frustrating than before
geez louise you guys are so spoiled because we had one drive we didnt score on
the most obviously fucking hold
lj needs to throw to get better at it this is his preseason we got to iron shit out by doing it
burrow looking like dalton today
wow look at that old man mcphee got a sack while judon is struggling against tes
their oline must be sooo bad if our dline looks legit
wow they need a new o line
im taking bets right now burros is not going to be able to walk for a week after today
beat his ass to destress from the previous weeks man
i wish we could face bobby hart every week
i thought bengals fixed their oline this year
i just figured it out the announcer thinks our qb is kyler murray
gus up the middle is an automatic 7 yards why are we just now seeing him
they have the worst ol i think ive ever seen jesus
gus should we be the starter ingram for passesrelief
the fact that burrow was able to get consecutive games with over 300 passing yards with this oline is impressive lol
lol romans woken up its over for the bengals now
burn the clock till the end of the half
gus edwards hair looking nice this year
theres still 5 mins left in the 2nd lmao
are we just not playing dobbins
some more designed run for lamar would be a change
burrow is going to have purple nightmares tonight
the way i see it the d has this on lockdown so they are treating this like a preseason game
play out music to commercial from the wireperfect
this d is suffocating
bro the steelers and eagles are tied
defense came to win today
props to wink he shook burrow there so hard he couldnt hit an open guy like 2 yards away
lmao is that the wire tune
seeing alex smith play is amazing
thats why you play dobbins baby
wait were actually good at running the ball when we try it incredible
jk all day
dobbins
what a run by dobbins
j

k

dobbins
i really really like dobbins
dobby is a free elf
less carries for ingram more for dobbins
lamar has missed a couple but also had defenders make great plays on two passes
give this man the ball more
that pass is not complete gumbel you fucking moron
what in the world lamar so dumb
terrible fucking pass wow
love the shot to hollywood idk why we didnt run on 2nd
sadly he freaking earned that should have been his third by now
ah it was tipped watch the replay
was that tipped
who was that pass to
these announcers suck
commentator sniffing glue
why are we taking the ball away from the run game for no reason
pass completed by lamar murray who the fuck is this announcer lol
to be fair it was tipped
the ravens are going full jail break on burrow and hes shook
that was just a bad play on all parties surely edc sees that we will not be next level elite as long as we have greg roman right
if we would play to our strengths instead of throwing every damn play
irrespective of the result of that play unlucky tip where has the run game gone in this offense do we not run the zone read anymore its like were playing with an arm tied behind our backs
fuck yeah get back out there lamar
one of our special teams guys was down holding his knee didnt see the number but looked in pain
fucking run the ball and stop calling trash pass plays
proche looked slow there
so what kind of play calling would our passing offense execute do we need another te
like why dont we run more of these quick hollywood throws let him get some yac
25 passes in the first half
stanley not even blocking his man
4 man rush is getting there instantly lamar has been bad but shit
i havent been able to watch every ravens game this year but can someone explain to me why jk isnt getting more touches he looks to be the most explosive rb they have and hes brought in often on passing plays so i cant imagine its a pass blocking issue what am i missing
at least they got one thing right this game about tucker
im sad now
i still love you tuck
fuck
glad we can at least give him a shot long shot but a shot
it was close
holy crap he finally missed
damn it put a little too much hook on it
awwww oh well
aight it was from 61 yards its ok tucker thats understandable
lamar mad he will kill them in 3rd quarter then rg3 will start the 4th
plenty of room tho if he had centered it i think it could be good from 65 imo
tuck ik you will drill the next 60 yarder i believe
impossible bengals mustve used a giant fan or something
we should be up more but overall it was a good first half just a lot of mistakes on offense were throwing way to much once again and luckily it hasnt bit us in the ass but it will against better teams

we need to run we had the most rushing yards in nfl history last year run the ball
we do not need to run the ball against the bengals this is the team to practice throwing 40 times on when crunch time comes against chiefs we are more prepared
lamar has been very poor but the man missed two practices and judging by his ig story it looks like he just lost a friend i have complete faith in our guy
i think orlando is being exposed now that yanda has retired need to go ol heavy in the next draft player permitting
jesus christ that should have been picked
i am worried
we have like infinite running backs but none are getting going at all seems like its hurting us to have so many
id like to see us work on some quickdeveloping pass plays that we can pull out like some screens or slants
man we need some wrs
burrows speed is shocking
holy the defense looks good today
deshon elliot wrapping up better than judon
burrow getting tossed today
huber is their mvp
at least we got defense when our offense is shitting the bed
burrow will die playing for cinci good god
roman must really see something in boykin he always on the fucking field running lazy routes
finally duvernay gets the ball
how is that not a horsecollar lol
can you fucking run the ball
he said murray again
thats a horse collar no
why do i keep saying murray lol
smh he keeps saying murray this is fucked up at some point he needs to stop
called him murray again
at least duvernay has been a positive
thats a ticky tack call
lol even the commentator realises hes saying murray
lol how many times is gumble going to call lamar murray
why didnt hollywood try to juke a lb
hollywood looking good today baby
i love how he calls him murray during the play then calls him lamar jackson 5 seconds later
just keep saying murray fuck it lol
lamar is not looking healthy based on that run
sucks that that was called back but its nice to see a deception run playcall
looks like that guy got hit by a bus
hollywood looks like rick moranis dark helmet character from spaceballs
finally lamar im used to defense never know whether hes gonna run or pass
the only new thing ive learned from this game is the announcers suck
whats the murray count at
announcers bad duvernay good
get the fuck out of the way boger
no idea wtf lamar was doing on that play
another pass play wtf roman this is giving me gray hairs
again 2 receivers right next to each other standing still
interference by the ref
run it lamar try and make something happen
or our receivers are unable to seperate
romans gotta go
incompetent play calling this game should be over by now
that drive isnt on lamar imo
35 attempts and we still have 20 minutes what is this game plan
looks like missing a couple days of practice has limited lamar more than we thought it would
marcus peters game mvp
i really wonder if were just experimenting with the play calling at this point
god bless our defense one side of the ball is behind spectacular today
does burrow even know what throwing the ball away is
fall on it lol
mp juiceman
wait thats illegal you cant bat the ball like that
the offense needs to wake the hell up
we need to be better about running more often but if lamar cant pick it up when we dont theres an issue
i hope we dont use this game as a reason not to add pieces to our defense
lets go offense lets put up another 17 and close this game
ok put it away on this drive run on 1st and 2nd down please greg
its time for the 8minute 16 rushing attempt td drive
ingram did something
so far our defense is winning this game offense hasnt mustered much of anything since the 1st
weve built plays to get duvernay in space now do other wrs lol
its as if running the ball is our strength
anyone else see aj green say trade me
this is the way
hey roman would you look at that the run game works
3 straight stupid passing play calls incoming
need a tall wr imo
wow who would have thought we could run the ball well
wow running the ball works
truzzzzzzz
we run the ball so well i love it
ugregroman see what happens when you run the ball
its like they didnt practice this week at all
i think boykin may have been confused on the route there
boykin is trash
burrow seeing ghosts
make these corners compete not sure thats my advice against marlo
28 consecutive games scoring 20 2nd most all time most is 30
announcers cheer leaders for bengals now
lamar should really just ignore the fact that boykins is on the field no point in even looking his way
does judson not like to wrap up
judon gifting another free down wtf
judon has not been making plays
yep judon again
still weird seeing someone wearing 92 that isnt ngata i miss him
17 mil
van halen got me big sad
lol this is getting ridiculous their pass pro is straight garbage
burrow just sitting down now lol
fuck i almost feel sad for burrow
every single one of our dbs is a better pass rusher than judon
damn the bengals need to get burrow an oline to keep him alive
at least burrow didnt get hit that play just went down smart play
marlo our best pass rusher
run ball eat clock
cincinnati matadors

ol
eagles fucking suck come on man i want first place back lol
use gus bus
judon is really just out there running around
burrow out here seeing ghosts
for fuck sakes we are up 20 run the fucking ball
jackson is straight up just not having a good game
its a sack party we now have 7 on the day chuckc36 and marlonhumphrey both get in on the action ravens
its raining so lets keep throwing
this oline is not doing well lamar is getting tricked on easy stuff time to go back to the study room and practice field to figure this out
lamar has looked sharp on some throws and totally off on others inconsistent game today

offense looks so asleep today
better be becuase lamar is hurt

x200b

and it better not be serious
good to see we had a day where defense picked up when the offense struggled we have a lot to clean up on offense oline is struggling a bit we need some faster developing plays

i dont get why we never ever run slants and let hollywood catch and run away through the defense
roman needs to stop overthinking this game and hop on the gus bus
if this offense was alive today we wouldve been up by 50 or something
fumble 6
queeeeeen me
marlon is a g
muh queen
yes queen
yaaaaas queen
the streak stays alive until next week
the defense won this game
marlo punch
lol queen got more tds than burrow
marlon top 2 not 2
humphrey punch again lol
queen getting aallll the nice stats
marlon lfg yessss
droy
fruit puuuunch
defense is putting on a show
patented marlo punch
humphrey is peanut punch 20
marlonnn punch
humphrey is the goat




change my mind
lol this game is something
just got home i am extremely pleased with this score and marlon humphrey is amazing but im seeing tons of complaining posts is the score misleading how had the offense looked
eagles with 15 straight points against the steelers only down by 2 now
only ingram has more yards on the ground than queen but queen has a td
marlon going for the dpoy award move over tjmyles
honestly if the defense can just score and keep the offense off the field we might make it to the afc championship game
and thats 20 straight quarters scoring points
as frustrating as this game has been at times it felt nice to go back to the flacco era for a game still need to fix our shit for next week though
anyone know how i can get an official black marlon jersey
so thats how they save game balls for the players cool shot the more you know
with how well our defense has been playing we should be up by 40 but nooooo roman is allergic to running and lamar is lost out there
philly is trying to make a game of it
rg3 coming in on our next drive or they gonna make lamar play it out
raiders up on the chiefs
does lamar stay out for the last drive to try and work on some issues or are we gonna see rg3 for the rest of the game
marlon is a young pat tillman
philly game is gonna be interesting their team may be trash but their dl is lethal they are going to see what cincy did rolling coverage underneath creeper blitzes and will try to emulate it
so what are the odds hump wins dpoty and queen wins droty if they keep up their pace
calais campbell is a grown ass man
burrow always just handing it off real quick now lol he shook
lets go raiders
fuck you philly
when did brown start returning
uhhhh we didnt play the chiefs last week
dude on the raiders has to try harder to pick up that first i get momentum and such makes it hard but he didnt even extend his arm
another stale passing game to start
on rushing the ravens lead rushers by carries are gus and ingram theyre averaging less than 325 yards a carry

the ravens are not a great run team this year its not the same team and not the same ol this isnt last year
the announcers just said groman deserves a lot of credit i knew they were senile but that seals the deal
who wants to start the fire greg roman petition
i think lamar was hurt more than we were led to believe and that makes his performance a bit easier to stomach
roman we just had a tremendous run yet you insist on dialing up weird pass plays
this is a game we need to try and get a passing game going i want to run just as much as anyone but at some point we will need to fall on the pass right now that isnt going to happen lets use this game to try get it going
judon earning no contract rn
two straight takeaways lol glad we could cover for judon sucking
lamar has overthrown receivers way too much this year he really needs to work on these deep balls
run the fucking ball
was a bad pass andrews was opem
can we start fucking blocking so lamar doesnt die jesus
longsnapper getting a tackle nbd
romans amnesia towards running is back they run the ball with great success but once again it gets abandoned why not keep running it
what is wrong with lamar this year
lamar needs to have his memory of the titans and kc games removed i think its fucking with him
oh shit 60
we should be annihilating this team by 4 scores right now
we need a new kicker
i never thought id be upset at a 3 score halftime lead but ho lee fuck roman is such garbage with how the defense has played this should be at least a 4 score game

ultimately it probably doesnt matter i doubt cincy comes back here but this is the sort of garbage you cannot allow against good teams

greg needs to clean his shit up asap
i honestly dont know who some of you are poo pooing a 170 shutout at halftime right now are all these people 2019 bandwagoners i will take a comfortable halftime lead over any team in the nfl
terrible play calls lmao you have all halftime and thats how you open
if yall havent already listen to the truss levelz podcast with mark ingram and cam jordan they had hollywood on and its a great interview about how his career started
please sign antonio brown
at this point we need to get a petition going to sign ab
ab yall need any wide receivers
ok can the dumb ingram slander in this sub stop now
running the ball effectively all drive then you throw it deep on 3rd and 3 eat shit come on man
boykin played that like it was a run play lamar shotput it out of bounds so it wouldnt have mattered anyways

burn this tape
i appreciate jimmy trying to get a pi there
nobody say anything bad about that pass or youre just a hater
the thing that makes lamar great is the fact that he is fast as fuck and illusive but nah lets not play to his strengths
the run game is not good this year its not a magic bullet that roman isnt using theyre just not run blocking well at all
lamar is having his second worst game of his career in the last 3 weeks this is getting super concerning
we can keep the shut out if they arent pussies and go for tds
looks like 142 was an overachievement not a standard
270 is pretty good guys
this has to be one of the worst wins in a long time for us
man hollywood take the fucking hit
key to the game pressure joe burrow early and do not let him get into any rhythm

i dont want any rookie mitchell trubisky flashbacks today
ou on the murray counter is 22 any bets boys
why the hell are we going for it up 17 put their backs to the goal line
is this commentator fucking cracked best play andrews has made all day
looks like 2 rookie qbs today

just bad decisions under pressure trying to make a play when the play is over smh lamar must have been reading his press clipings in between workouts
two minute drill lets see some deep passes to hollywood
lets call a spade a spade the blocking isnt good anymore we need a speed back to take any hole we can get dobbins should get way more carries in this offense
lamar now has more pass attempts at halftime than he should have had for the entire game makes zero sense averaging almost 8 yards per carry but we continue to throw
13 total rushes and 29 pass attempts is the story of this game they cant just transition to this we need more runs read options and designed qb runs too much passing
so people are going to say or saying why is lamar throwing so much just playing devils advocatethe ravens running game is low key bad they get a chunk of their yardage when up big look at the stats from the previous wins i personality think jk dobbins is our best back for this current team and we should use him more best receiving rb of the 3 ingram looks old and our oline just looks horrible at run blocking i think coaches decided if we lose its better to lose with lamar throwing than out run game getting exposed
it just seems like any throwing play thats called lamar literally doesnt have the time necessary for the pay to develop and is forced to do something with the ball or just get sacked 20 times a game the o line has no protection for him to safely sit there and wait for these horrible calls to develop he has 2 targets the rest is just the actors who dont get a roll in the credits its easy to predict gromans play calls and to tell we just wont run the ball hence why it seems every defense gets deep in our backfield defense have become aware of what it takes to stop lamar and thats take away his team and have 2 minimum linebackers watching him to step up to the line when he breaks out of the pocket and groman has not done a thing to stop that or help
why are we still passing
stop saying murray you fucking bum
lol gus just destroyed that dt lolol
pretty awful offense it just feels so weird
might need a young oc next season because this is not it
flacco td
oh look ma another judon special one more for the hat trick
this offense does not have the same magic as last year and that worries me
queen capitalizes
or defense has scored more than their offence best d performance in a long time
these announcers racist af
if our offense stuck to the actual game plan instead of trying to prove its a passing offense we could have had 50 points today
tucker missed what a scrub lmao

s
people are acting like lamar hasnt been regressing since the texans game
lamar looks awful this year
lamar just not on point today
damn that was a stupid throw by lamar
tin foil hat

lamars knee is more serious then the team is leading on and we are play calling accordingly
go figure chase claypool is balling out while boykin is shitting the bed how tf do we always miss on wars while pittsburgh hits


edit wrs
wake the fuck up
some of the oline decisions this year have been interesting ravens really dont like fluker at guard or do they just really want him to be their tackle depth i get the depth point of keeping him in reserve but if he can run block hard at guard it could be a better starting line potentially interesting to say the least
aj green has been quiet lets hope it stays this way

hes a ravens killer

id like to see duverney get more looks today

should be a great game hope the rain stays away
ask about the poop nate
i hope we win
ahem caw
im excited football makes me happy
found an unopened chrome cast sitting around the house that i got as a gift a while back decided to set it up but it turns out you have to have ios 12 or later to set it up and since i have an iphone 5 i cant even download that software pretty annoyed you cant just set it up on your computer but i guess its watching on the laptop for me today
letsssss goooooo
2am game day lets go
why did we keep chris moore just to inactive him every week
fuck the bengals

hi everyone

have a good day
wish we had on the purple jersey black pants combo truly one of the best ever
campbell towers over everyone lol
good defense
thats it right there
yo lets get some sacks dlineplease
did harbs catch burrows out of bounds throw
proche bailed out lol
omg that playcall was sweet
i am liking this playcalling
duve is our lord and saviour
hes fast yo
run the ball
ko getting carted off in kc
duve got some damn wheels i thought he was gone
i wanna see more duvernay on my screen
son i am proud of you
goddamn it
forgot bynes when there lol why guess thats the life of an nfl journeyman
damn it man
all i can see is that crazy left lean now when tucker kicks
trying way too hard to force the pass to work if the run is working do that shit until they stop it
i see we are trying to be a pass heavy team early again smh
dev duv was wide open there
this offense just isnt clicking this year and theyre still rolling over the teams they should roll over imagine what itll be like if they get it together
we need to be finishing more of our drives but ill definitely take the points
feel like were going to be using tucker a lot more this year
we continue forcing the pass every week
like is greg roman just a big tease pulls out a run play for big then calls 2 throws that are just easily defended im almost half expected to see a haha ive just been joking the first half
gus jk mark lamar j hill but nah lets pass on 1st down
do people get the cutouts sent to them after the game
the fuck is that big ass dude wide open
i will never get over tyler boyd dude haunts me
nice wheels
proof burrow is the bengals
a good throw and thats an int lol
i cant imagine what its like running away from calais campbell
so whos a realistic player we could add for consistent pressure
feels good to actually get consistent pass rush for once
we better not play soft man or zone here
good stop lfg
analysts have queen as an excellent athlete thats having trouble learning his responsibilities at the position but he flashes anyway so im very excited for him
ew
that screen pass was so obvious lol
lol hollywood to scared to get yards
really swing pass to brown is that the best greg roman has
has passing to marquise behind the los ever gotten us yards
i am worried about hollywood again avoids contact like hes hiding a rib injury or something
that play should not go to brown
brown goes out of his way just so he wont get hit
hollywood is eventually going to have to take contact like sometimes you need an extra yard or two ive never seen him take on contact
marquise beefed up but he still looks like a kid out there lol
that made no sense
there u go marquise
hell yes seems like forever since weve converted a third down with a pass
someone find lamars deep ball plz
run the ball
lamar has awesome offangle passes gotta get that deep ball settled though
gain 6 yds on first down tjrow behind the line to our smallest offensive player come on gro
duvernay has really found his place and i love it
first down runs set up 3rd and short all season last year why have we abandoned this
pat is 305 lbs what
holy fuck andrews
aerial andrews
should have stuck landing
i give it a 1010
jesus what a scary tackle
lmaaaaaaao andrews got table topped
i 100 thought that ball was flying out on that flip lmao
that was scary looking
run the god damn ball
lamar gotta throw that ball away
damn andrews
we cant afford to have our tes get hurt we only got two lol
i hate our passing game
this offense just been looking out of sync the last few games
mark andrews with the crazy flip
we need to pipe in bullshit chants for when the refs throw flags
he thinks he watching kyler murray
second and 14 lets pass the ball why set up for a reasonable third
what the fuck is this announcer drunk
why the fuck does he keep saying murray
mandrews came to play today thank god
damn hell of a conversion there lamar had to sit in there and feel that pressure
wait shouldnt that penalty call the play dead
lamarandrews better combo than bacon and eggs
just me or has lamar lost his touch on quite a few of these passes
ok u can stop calling him that now greg
slandrews
murray again
slip that guy a note and tell him his name is jackson
this offense just looks slow and hesitant
someone get me this clowns twitter and im gonna tell him to put some respeck on lamars name
mandrews
murray ingram owns a deli
harbaugh has been working on his mask game
surprised he didnt call him kamara instead of ingram
i wish they would show more all 22 replays like that maybe people will get to see whos actually opennot open instead of instantly blaming the qb lol
touchdown
mandrews came to fucking play
i love ingram love him but get dobbins in here
he did it again its not murray
mandrews
the flipper scores
murray
murray takes the snap
thank god for mark andrews dude is so fucking great
andrews okay
a sloppy looking drive but it paid off p
lol thats a mans catch
this drive was brought to you by mandrews
and 1
actually it is murray andrews for us though we shorten it to mandrews
mandrews
gumble got my tired brain all confused rn
the ravens just methodically choke the life out of opponents this year
mandrews with the td
even with some intense interference mandrews pulls it down
that was a dot
steelers getting help down the field by the refs what a joke

also mandrews
lamar looked so poised in the pocket
god damn that guy was all over andrews then great throw and catch for the score
my best kicker in the league just incase you were wondering
yo who the bleep is murray
is lamar jacksonmurray a dr jekyllmr hyde type of thing
big man plays
is it me or is lamars long pass not as good as it was last season
lamar looks like hes struggled a little this year im finding the open receiver at the right time a lot of times hes pulled back for a throw pump pump pump and then throws it into traffic this td isnt a perfect example but it just seems like hes doing that a lot this year and it all seems to be related to being uncertain huge assumption and guesses obviously but just an observation
glad that mike andrews jason tucker justin hill and marvin humphries finally have their leader for the blertimore footbirds lamurray jackson
the crowd noise is way too loud on cbs are there actual people there
how long till this commentator calls burrow flacco
mp juiceman
did we just blitz marlon tf we say about that
peters
mp juiceman
turnover streak stays alive
the qb pressure feeds marcus peters
what was the wide receiver doing
mp grape juice man
thanks burrow
the streak lives on
24 is both the most exciting and most frustrating db ive seen on the ravens
there it is
pass rush that works create turnovers
best defensive quarter weve had all season actual pass rush
lets fucking gooooo
galaxy brain lamar
what was green doing
aj green playing like a raven
okay all joking aside what the hell is with the murray nonsense dude the reigning mvp and you dont know his damn name
ok lets go lamurray
lmao looked like peters motioned for green to block for him
oh i thought he was hurt
marcus peters is definitely living up to his boom or bust reputation this year
ravens twitter is on top of shit no sooner had peters caught the ball did they have a tweet on it
big yikes by burrow on that decision thats the rookiest thing ive ever seen him do so far this season
jeez refs figure it out
smart to throw that away instead of taking the huge loss wish our failed endarounds knew how to do that

edit guess the blocking means ineligible man downfield
what is the murray count
this guy loves murray
murray
they dont offset weird
how does he not know this is lamar jackson he doesnt have to look at his player number list to know its lamar jackson obviously his sheet says murray for 8 how dense does someone have to be to be not recognize that
gumbel is like who lamar jackson is i only know a murray
is this announcer senile
15 yards for touching
he said jackson
thats a little acting there by lamar hahaha

ill take it tho
whos lamar jackson
not gonna lie lamar was playing that shove up like a premier league player
mark andrews this game man
great play by murray
is there a running count on how many times lamar gets called murray
mark andrews is having himself a game guys really proud of our boy so far
hollywood hill
hollywood
there we go
finally a hollywood td
lamar is so fucking good in the redzone man
at least we embraced the murray into a new meme we can thank his fuck ups for the hilarious memes upcoming
all to easy
hollywood hopkins
hollywood got one
murray to hill for the td
flacco looking stoic in the pocket
ayyyy 1st touchdown of many for the year for hollywood brown
some tight throws
short comoflauged marquise literally impossible to see in the end zone
im loving hollywoods headband
hell yes get marquise brown that td
hollywood
im crap with mem making but someones got to do a photoshop of a murrys steaks box with lamar on it
were fucking business
hollywoooooooooooood
lets go murrays
all the time baker spends in the stadium and still does not have a winning season
was hoping this would be a get right game for both our offense and defense and im pretty happy so far
go kyler go
lol were like 4 seconds into the 2nd quarter and theyre like cincinnati needs to abandon all plans the game is over
do you guys remember the game last year then kept calling out boys mark jackson and lamar ingram
lol the bengals returner running like he shit his pants
marquise goodwin with the td
don murray martindale is bringing the heat today
lets go iggles beat dem stillers
time to unleash madubuike
i want another lamarvelous run for old times sake
lets go iggles battle of pennsylvania tied 77
that throw for the brown td was beautiful jacksons getting pretty good at those across the body passes
gotta get the sack there but good play d
judon almost had him
another whiff by judon lol
so close matt
sacking like burrow is breathing covid in their faces
jesus christ call a fucking hold
judon if you could finish your have like 4 more sacks this year alone
judon sucks
ah the classic judon feast game
we gotta get those maaaaan
anyone watching the cardinals game able to tell us how many times theyve called kyler lamar
sit ur ass down
false shart
joker living up to his nickname right there lmao
judon was definitely offsides
pick negated by offside
fucking judon
fuck you judon
damnit judon
judon go fuck yourself
trade judon right now smh
judon your fired
goddammit
god damn judon is so fucking bad
damn it judon
ferguson setting an edge pump that shit into my veins
great job judon stellar
dog house incoming
at this point i dont even want judon for vet min get him the fuck out
its a free play dumb announcer
only reason burrow threw that was cause he knew there was a penalty
lol powned from the back
flacco is 69 for 39 yards
we can not get rid of judon soon enough
thanks judon
queeeeen
back to back turnovers lol
the queen in the north
i repeat bengals gonna bengal
judon lol
we giving backshots out here boys
lol i feel so bad for burrow the poor guys just getting bullied and clobbered
oh good hit queen
queen
queen
judon and offsidesname a more iconic duo
his name is patrick motherfucking queen
lol that o line is gonna get joe killed
i do fucking love queen
damn i should have said muh qweeeen
lfg queen
wheres dobbins
muh queen
burrow just got dominated lol
burrow is getting whacked out there

just realized queen and burrow used to be buddies at lsu must suck getting strip sacked by a friend
queen hitting his former teammate who is now a bengal that hard forcing a fumble is a fucking piece of art
i hope we fuck big ben up like this
bengals fan coming in here w respect yall are good expected this to be closer but i forgot about our horrible o line hoping yall win division instead of the steelers or browns
i feel like madubuike is making a difference as well we finally look a bit better at pressuring now to keep it up against better offensive lines
these announcers love burrow meanwhile hes having a shitty gameand they cant get the reigning mvp names right
what sucks is after this game everyone will say that we only play well against bad teams solely based off of the chiefs game its like did you not watch us beat up 6 playoff teams last year
love the ravens but man its hard to see burrow have such a shit line hes a great talent
we need to go for it on fourth the dagger
that wasnt the greatest playcall
mekari may just need to start at guard at this point line is holding up a little better today
yeah go for it
let him kick it
burrow is definitely talented and if the bengals can build around him they will be a threat

however thats a tall task for a team who consistently sucks at drafting like cincinnati does
just saw zrebiec say powers in at rg i didnt notice when we switched away from mekari
i didnt want to go for that one of the few times i agree with commentators youre up 17 and defense is paying lights out
i have no problem going for that i hate punting inside the 50
you know who to put in if youre going to throw on 4th down
lamar needs to be sharper i feel like hes forcing it
poor throw he had him but not sure i like the decision to go for it
well that was a spirited play call
if we know were going for it on 4th then why not run the ball with this record breaking rb group on 3rd
who tf can we rely on besides mandrewshollywood sometimes
good decision and good call had him but just overthrew him
we need to run the fucking ball too
that was murray not lamar
lamar missing a lot of throws again
lamar makes awful throw to open receiver run the ball wtf why are we passing fuck you roman
looks like we need more options on offense
offense is getting a little cheeky and sloppy after dominating so far we have too much football left
i dont like how lamar throws the ball on 9 routes to the right he doesnt put air under it he just guns it

i think it has something to do w his low release point he needs to get the ball up over more especially on those types of routes

its a mechanical issue can that be fixed at this point
black jerseys look neato
fort played that so well
offensive holding sighting
mcphee looking fantastic
just turned the game on can someone do a tldr of whats happened so far how we looking today
lamar will be fine but he is anticipating pressure every play and rushing every read
holy shit a 4man pass rush sighting
is mad boogie the pass rush difference
given the way our defense looked there we would have likely had a safety if we punted the ball
sacked again i love it
apparently 2014 pernell mcphee replaced modern day mcphee right before this last drive
gus gets extra yardage just falling down
andrews playing great d
lamar you gotta learn to throw it out
love gus want more
good defense andrews
lamar is playing way too cocky
eeek lamar dont do that
idk if you can tell but rich gannon used to be a quarterback he very rarely mentions it
lamar better buy mandrews a beer
lamar wtf are you doing
show me your
we need ben grubbs
lol yeah cox
hmmmmm cant remember the last time i saw cox in on a tackle
the google stat trackers arent working today kind of annoying i like to keep an eye on what else is happening in the league
ot iggles are giving the steelers all they can handle so far
lets get a stop here and get the ball to end the half and start the 3rd come on wink
bengals o really struggling out there were getting pressure with 4 regularly 5 is almost too much for the line to handle so nightday compared to the chiefs game
bowser and ferg are showing a lot more promise this season
when you walk through the garden

you gotta watch your back

well i beg your pardon

walk the straight and narrow track
how is this the first time ive heard the wire music in a ravens broadcast
anyone know how flacco is doing stats not showing up on google for me score 70 tho cards
wtf jk
gotta love jk
joe burrow looks so sad lol
this is why we need to use dobbins more often
that was a great throw to hollywood but good d on it
jk get him touches
good pass finally
that couldve been caught
jk dobbins holy shit what a beast
can we please start giving dobbins touches in the 1st quarter of games
i like the deep shot after the run i know its taboo here to say something positive about the play calling
that was a nice pass nice protection
yeah give the ball to dobbins more
yeah stop fucking around give it to jk
dobbins sighting
jesus lamar threw it right to him
jesus thats two weeks in a row weve turned in over in that scenario
what the fuck throw was that
lamar what is you doing bby
hollywood needs to catch that ball and our oline needs to do better
where the fuck was that ball even going
great run by dobbins

hell probably only get two more carries today
burrow is getting killed every play
that ball came out disgusting
shaking my god damn fucking head can we give gro a shot of covid so we can find a better play caller
goddamn lamar
i want to hit roman the amount of incomplete incomplete 3rd and 10 hard blitzed is annoying as shit why in the fuck would you not run on 2nd and 10 dobbins just ran for 30 fucking yards they are literally sabotaging lamar
what game is greg gumbel watching
burrow is gonna get david carrd
good god borrow will be lucky to walk off the field after this game
lamar doesnt even look like he wants to be out there
burrow wont survive the year with this line
will they at some point take burrow out to keep him whole
lamar havin a shitty game
obj blocking absolutely no one yet again
bro who is gilchrist hes getting a lot of playing time
gerry sandusky is roasting opposing players names on the audio broadcast lmao
i love hearing those pads pop
so are we gonna throw a ball to boykin oooorrrrrr
i dont understand how we can watch from the outside and realize that lamar succeeds when our rush offense is churning roman is refusing to play to his strengths so damn frustrating last season was a great balance and it showed that when the run was established lamar could do anything through the air
why are we not playing out of the pistol anywhere near as much this year
dont need to use timeouts when 2nd down is incomplete and 3rd down goes oob thanks bengals
this team is really really reliant on momentum in the passing game you cant have dropped passes and missed throws it takes a toll in the moral of the offense
yes its a rookie and the bengals but boy our d is playing well today
david culley is who we thought he was
holly wood didnt just go out wow
they have a free rusher on every play because theyre sending the house trusting that lamar cant make the throws
burrow is just being eaten alive
has lamar run once yet
why has lj been so hesitant to take off
61 yarder incoming
damn
noooo tucker why
rip
no 61 yarder
still the goat
fuck
tucker missed that tells you all you need to know about how this game is going so far

in all seriousness tho shit happens even the best in the league gets a mulligan every now and then
he missed one boys time to release him
shouldve known once they started hyping him up
damn hate that the first miss was from 60 no one will blame him but i was hoping for a perfect season from the goat
pretty bad week for lamar huh knee injury plus the thing with his friend and all man thats crazy
damn osemele down with a knee injury
i knew we passed a lot in the first half but 29 attempts already maybe were running all second half so lamar had to get a games worth of passes in the first half
i think these kinds of games are better for us in a long run
hopefully they are just using this game to force the pass to iron things out it wouldnt be the worst scheduled game to do it on im still very worried about what i see
has lamar ever had 4 yards

like ever
its not raining at fed hills wtf
what if theres a bigger game plan a season long plan keep rbs fresh so they arent injured and tired at the end of the year
dealing with wet balls
that was like the 4th almost int
jesus
these plays we are running lmaooooo what the fuck
feelsbadman
this is awful to watch wheres the patience
our offense would be so much better if we utilized drags outs slants and screens but for some reason roman refuses to run anything that takes less than 5 seconds to develop
does burrows always look grumpy or is it just today
bottom text
boom
woof burrow lit the fuck up
nice of burrow not to make elliott look silly with his speed
lol we sent both safeties
it certainly feels like mcphee turned his clock back to 2014 doesnt it
poor burrow worst division for him to be drafted to with that oline
i swear we just refuse to use jacksons athleticism
the ravens have 14 total rush attempts lol
we are still in fucking shotgun
my patrick queen rookie of the year 1200 bet looking pretty nice right about now
finally
its murray up the middle
wtf that was such a soft hold
lets keep doing these screens
why do i keep calling him murray is this guy demented
please give duv more playing time hes outplaying boykin by a mile
bryant gumbel is dreadful today
murray
hollywood made good on that
a good play
much better lamar
i mean we are playing awful but that was just a good fucking block
im making this comment so i can remember the last time the ravens made a screen that worked
gumble is demented
yes why
must be embarrassing to be stiff armed by the smallest guy in the league
eagles are fucking useless
lamar could have easily run there
finally seeing the old lamar
the bus broke a bengal
hollywoods ballin out today
that bengal looks like he got hit by a bus
cant keep lamar down for long
wtf bozeman lol
ben powers replaced patrick mekari at right guard
nice 3rd down conversion through the air
youd think you could remember the name of last years season mvp

ingram looks like an aging rb now not cutting running into his linemans asses
has anyone else noticed the players are sharing a single water bottle arent they supposed to have their own random thought
lamar has drive to always clean up his mistakes we good guys
ref lol
jfc just get rid of the ball
as frustrating as the play calling is i agree with what several others have said in an easily winnable game why not take the opportunity to work on our deficiencies as opposed to doubling down on our strength run game
lol even the official gets the stiff arm
unrelated but i love these mark hamill jon stewart uber eats commercials
holy shit someone fucking chip the edge on a boot how does this keep happening
lmfao
i kinda wanted a fake punt just to see some action
even lamar juking out refs
lamar seems as if he wants to prove that hes a qb he has lanes to run with but he feels as if he needs to shake the rb narrative
this is not the offense i fell in love with last year im getting so frustrated with this playcalls and decisions
time to throw on redzone and watch this game on mute these announcers are unbelievably stupid
so can like someone explain to me why romans refuses to run the fucking ball
last year lamar would have taken off for like 20 yards what the fuck is going on this offense went from unstoppable to looking totally lost
35 pass attempts midway through the 3rd quarter
why is roman still passing the fucking ball i think this man is legitimately braindead
at least the defense is good
god lamar hasnt looked sharp at all since kc
just fall on the damn ball
slick ball damn it
we need better interior oline the bengals are getting way too much pressure overall things could be worse but with a better line lamar has more time do the receivers can get open and he has time to make better decisions and get set to throw better passes
thank god for our defense
14yard run time to pass
oh look a run
i wish we had some damn route running receivers that can get open
this playcallint literally has me fucking baffled
we ran the ball and good things happened funny that
oh my god a first down
wow this looks like 2019
yes ingram thats what we fucking need would you look at that running works
who said ingram is done
mark heard yall
why are we not passing s
vintage ingram
lol these announcers
bout time id rather just keep pounding the rock than rely on this o line for pass protection right now no need to pass at all
if ljs knee is bugging him itd explain some of his poopy throws shit starts from the ground up
shit yea ingram
wow i wonder what the score would be rn if we had run the ball more than 5 times in the last 4 drives
our offense and defense is straight up bad statistically rn
so you saying running the ball works well too
now maybe from now on we can start running the ball 3 quarters sooner
um what
that shift is fresh tho
automatuck
i play madden a lot and this is where a db misses a tackle on a mixon run between the tackles to ruin the shutout
another 3 and out plswith a few hits on the side
3rd and 3 and been destroying them on the ground and you dont run play action probably wouldve guaranteed an open right end
ocho cinco
judon missed tackle again lol
boykin is supposed to be a jump ball receiver and he doesnt even jump just give duvernay his reps he needs them and would hardly be worse
man judon is not even good in coverage is there anything this guy actually excells at
ferguson has been making plays
sack daddy setting the edge like a pro
fuck off judon
judon is so bad my lord
judon come on man
im i the only one thats noticed burrow has too much air on nearly all of his throws
pass rush a bit better but not super confidenceinspiring offensive line seemed to have played a bit better like the first 2 drives and now back to turnstiles lamar is getting pressured like crazy boykin i like you but duv
welcome to the nfl burrow
humphrey dude is so good in coverage hes been invisible all game
up 20 to 0 in the 4th quarter time to pass
call detroit and get kenny golladay
this d made burrow look like the rookie that he is lol

were business
is that 8 sacks on the day bengals should take 3 ol next year
the ravens have held opponents scoreless in the third quarter this season the only nfl team to do so pmgleason
winks defensive play calling creates nightmares for rookie qbs
last years offense with this defense we would have scored 100
what
jesus christ lamar what are you doing
okay jacksons gotta chill out a little
anyone gonna blame someone for not running the right route on yet another nearint
oh man i have a feeling hes having trouble seeing schemed lbs in there
need to practice extra hard this week blowing out a division rival and still feeling like were struggling
wow
whats the point of the mask if you just take it off to talk
cant keep emphasizing that division games are typically very close
lamar not reading the field like he used to today
i love how orlando looks huge even standing next to other linemen
good route by boyd but man i hate him
peters wants another to
roman needs to get his head out of his ass hes been the reason this offense is so lackluster the past 4 weeks
offense has some time to adjust in the meantime ill take 1420 point wins while were working on it lol
yas queen
we need to sign mr big chest hes had months of therapy now he should be alright
queen is the man of the match
pq boiiii
killa queen x2
defense is carrying this team
what a play by marlon holy shit
just i was about to say damn theyre getting some momentum with all these completions
defensive player of the year in the running
hump and queen again
f r u i t p u n c h
i feel like we can add two more wins to our record because the browns and bengals aint doing shit on our defense
fruit punch
defense has done it all today
i would not be surprised to hear that lamar is still sick
this is exciting by defence
hay is in the barn fellas
come on philly
is harbs wearing two masks lol
use nflredzone and say queen is the rookie of the day dont let claypool win it
couple times
afcn may only look so good cause it has played a light schedule
it isnt a ravens game if the defense doesnt score
no offense but thats the first good throw by burrow all game
campbelllllllll
free release good throw still want this shutout though
defense is gonna have to make something happen to keep the shutout alive
fake crowd noise guy has been better this week
romans past his prime he was good for his first moment in bmore but now other teams know how to stop him this wouldnt be much of an issue if he didnt malfunction every game and forget the ravens are a runfirst offense also it seems like he cant adjust to teams that dont let the ravens steamroll them
boooooooo
barnacles
look any game we arent tied and going into overtime for is a good game we gave them a pity fg
why do i feel like the chiefs can still come back
i admit ill be shocked if the raiders dont fuck themselves somehow lol
yall think were the worst 41 team going into next week
anyone else notice how lamar never ever changes the play nor the protection thats a big problem why dont we let him is he not able or what
i swear if they comeback im gonna break my tv
3 and 3 lets not give it to edwards fuuuuck i hate greg roman
have the real ravens been kidnapped or something today
greg roman scares me
is 2 ocs a thing gro is a great run caller but his passing plays are straight out of madden
pass rush still looks nonexistent
we need ray and suggs to come in and teach the defense how to get pressure and execute tackles i feel like our defense isnt scary our secondary is good but we dont play tight coverage often based off the open man every 2 plays
lamar looks like ass right now and im sad
judon is fucking garbage i wasnt happy when he was tagged and im still not dude is not a fucking franchise player
dang all these comments mad at judon i thought he had a personal foul or something it was obvious he was offsides i dont know burrow wouldve thrown that int otherwise
lamar what you doing bby
lamar looking a little off


edit im blind it was tipped
i disagree with the announcers i like the call to go for it
im confused

fire roman
sigh how long before greg romans amnesia towards running the football leaves him and he stops calling like 20000 pass plays
3 runs in a row 3 positive yard plays i think we did it guys we fired greg roman
kyler jackson with a 2 yard rushing td
hollywood gotta catch that
our offense is garbage but im starting to feel bad for what were doing to theirs
we lead but our offense stinks right now but were so good im happy anyways
im laughing just a little at the whole welcome to the afc north for joe burrow when hes already played the browns
lamar does not seem to want to run the ball anymore
lamar does not look healthy he doesnt look comfortable
defense gonna save our ass this year
take a deep breath guys were up 3 scores in the second half and our defense is dominating them maybe this play calling is an attempt to get our passing some reps against a live defense in a low risk situation
he didnt even go through his progressions on that play could of easily picked up 3 with his legssomething is wrong for sure
flacco is actually playing well right now
the bengals have been embarrassed 3 straight times by lamar if anyone has film on him it should be cincinnati
obligatory yas queen
if lamar belongs in the same tier as the great qbs then why do fans get so mad with all of the pass calls
campbell is a man beast
darn was hoping for a shutout
sign antonio brown
wtf lamar ruined a great drive by the running attack

marcus peters has been trash this year
wtf was that lamar horrible
why cant lamar read defenses anymore early last year he was really good at it
so what is everyone gonna complain about today after we win 343
might have to turn the game off greg roman is soooooo bad
im so tired of seeing lamar throw
is it just me or has lamar regressed this year lol
i find that little joker gesture that elliott does pretty cringey i know its his nickname but i hope he stops doing it soon lol
unfortunately were going back to what we were known for for years and years our defense atleast we can say that offense looking like its ran by flacco
people will shit on roman and rightly so but the reality ia lamar is awful at throwing hot and he needs to be much better at that to stop defenses from sending 7 guys after him like the bills and titans did last year
damn burrow gonna be legit just off his decision making
guess its time to abandon the run good call roman
joe lamar jackson burrow
really fucking good throw
fucking trashdon
they might bench burrow at this point lol
i have a theory why we are throwing

roman has been instructed by decosta to have lamar throw deep and into coverage in order to drop his overall value the more incompleteness and ineffective he is the less money he will command in the offseason in a couple years for his extension



or roman is just a fucking idiot
lamar has regressed this year for sure
cool play id love to see wildcat to ingram lamar on the right hollywood on the left ingram takes snap and takes entire line and team right pitch to lamar and hollywood is taking off 1 on 1 down the left sideline

you know hollywood would be burning whoever hes against
wow look what happens when jk gets the ball who would have thought
dobbins needs more touches
thats an ugly ball tho
our offense is pretty bad
this has not been a well called game on offense i like to see a bit more balance between the run and pass seems like we pick one or the other for a drive and focus on it
sacks and flacco check downs give the bengals d credit for disrupting this offensive
what a terrible kicker
why tf arent we playin dobbins more
anyone else think that knee injury might be affecting lamar more than we let on he hasnt had a run yet has he

edit a word

i cant watch the game can one of you tell me which link in the o line appears weakest where are all the rushers getting through
i need a word with roman and our wr coach wtf are you guys doing
surprised to see marquise do anything after the catch lol
damn gus killed him
roman might need to go after this season wtf
please lets run the ball run out the clockk get rg3 in there let lamar rest
25th in total offense greg roman deserves a ton of credit
trash absolute garbage
that was bad on boykin but why would lamar even throw that on 3rd down dude was locked up man to man
i feel like jackson relies on the defence falling apart at the idea of him running when they dont he makes bad judgment calls
judon is such a piece of shit
so boykin overthrow maybe it was the angle but it looked to me boykin stopped on the route and lamar had thrown a much deeper route
im legit starting to think that romans marty 20 why does this happen with every oc on the ravens there has to be something deeper happening
today in a nutshell
we had one of the most explosive offenses last year today has been far from perfect but dont hang your heads that team didnt just disappear we will start to click again i have faith in that

the real takeaway should be how well our defense is playing yes its the bengals but its always good to see your defense playing dominant like they are supposed to be
maybe romanvis calling pass plays to show lamar hes not ready to be a pure pocket passer yet
thats mah queen
lamar is kill murray is new favorite player

who is currently putting up a worse performance lamar or the announcers
can greg roman please stop changing the offensive identity like he has amnesia yes you can pass but if the run is working then use it
what is wrong with him
lamar looking like a rookie
feels like flacco is starting for us today not the jets
i dont think lamar has control of the offense he needs to step up this year and take over mahomes and allen have full control it seems while lamar seems like hes just taking instructions this year
poll is miles boykin good leave your answer below
yall need to relax
god damn lamar stop playing like a fucking rookie fix your decision making
please keep telling me how this isnt on lamar

playing like fucking baker mayfield
our offense is dog shit this year
could this be the trace mcsorely game
anyone have any idea if fans will be allowed back in this year
time to make my coffee big trusssssss lets gooooooo
any thoughts on how the weather impacts this game
mekari is warming up at rg according to jeff
anyone not playing today
bengals game plan screen screen deep incompletion to green punt
i actually miss dan dierdorf he was a great color commentator
for your thread streaming comfort
lfg
im really glad i dont have to sit through big bang theory ads during games anymore little victories
woooooo lfg
lego
big day for the d comin right up
lets fucking go

move the kickoff 10 yards forward and award a point for putting it through the uprights
jesus christ its game day
our pash rush actually got close to burrow thats how you know the bengals have a bad oline
defense pls
lfg ravens
we didnt have a sample on him
na jimmy smith not judon
man if you are going to let bounce get away from it
classic bengals
thank god were playing bobby hart this week so judon can pump up those sack numbers
jimmy smith leading the nfl in sacks so far today
can we call them bagels
go llama
bengals will be straightup out coached today
lets fucking gooo bitches
duuuuuuuuuuuuuu
holy shit
duvernay
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
good call gro
keep giving him playing time sirs
i love duvernays speed
holy shit duvernay got wheels
i got a fever and the only prescription is more duvernay
lets go duuuuuuuuuv
duuuuuuuuuuuuv
duv
feed duvernay in space
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuvvvvvvvvv
nice play
duv needs to be our 2 target hes so good
damn
tuck it in
duvernay has had so few touches but made so many big plays
wish we ran the ball at least twice after that big run but o well get points when you can
anyone know if lamar has knee pain
what else is new ravens dont score a td and win by fg
duvernay is earning some more pt


tucker
whywhy do we always do stupid play calls near the red zone
why are they forcing the ball down the field so early in the game
duverney is pretty clearly our best weapon but greg roman will utilize him for 3 plays all game
2 forced passes there
two perfectly good throws by lj and both brown and andrews too afraid to go for the ball
sometimes it feels like lamar is trying to force it to mandrews and teams are double covering him now
why are we so insistent on making lamar pass when we have so much invested in the run we are designed to grind teams down with 8 min drives so do it
cutouts lowkey creepy ngl
mad boogies first tackle
the guy was standing there eating lunch defense took a nap
wtf with these wide open receivers
he had all day in the pocket
didnt know bengals have butter bean on their roster
looked like peters was the one that left higgins just standing there i just dont get it
how
please dont get aj green involved thats never a good thing for us
get this stop set the tone boys
ineed alink to watch the game can never watch where iam
oh no they dont
wow good stop
good job d
he probably couldve run that for a first tbh
this week and last week these threads have been just the regulars where are all the bandwagoners been a quiet couple game threads
i say we keep throwing we should experiment against the not so good teams
yea i thought judon looked banged up on that last series
zach taylor kinda lost out there

burrow would be a stud on any team
ingram still making grown ass men bounce off him
didnt fool anyone
hell i saw that coming
d was great there announcer said it was overthrown but watching the replay that was the only spot burrow could have placed the ball the give his guy a shot coverage was phenomenal there
wtf was that
what a stupid ass call roman
o line looks a lot better
so teams are amazing at screens against us but we cant run a screen to save our lives
that was an incredibly poorlydesigned play
dn if he didnt hesitate he had 10 more
move the chains
we mustve broadcasted that damn cincy was all over that
whyd he stop man
what was that throw
duv
duuuuv
duvernay out here making plays
i like seeing dev more involved
what the hell was that
beep beep
all aboard the gus bus
bus
that was a sweet side arm pass to duv
lmao the reason he ran a lot in college from the pocket was that his line was garbage
ran into a wall though
looks like cincy is loading up the middle of the line
truss the bus
these snaps are wild lamar back there never knowing where the snap is going to fly
holy shit lol
whoa
windmill andrews
damnnn lol
damn andrews did a full 360 there
dat flip goddamn mandrews
oh my butthole puckered phew
mandrews with a manly flip
flip
who knew andrews was a gymnast
dude was on a trampoline holy shit
omg what a flip
man lamar is way off
sighhhhh
oh no not boger
why they gotta show that graphic right now trying to jinx llama
ok i like that
james proche getting more reps
mandrews saves the day
mark andrews has really redeemed himself these past 2 weeks since the chiefs game
didnt think that was a 1st
dude lamar looks hella off right now that lob was a nice idea but it was nowhere close
someone needs to clip all the times hes called him murray
ill never understand how you can break huddle with no time left and have no idea
damn what a throw
mandrews
get it mandrews
murray to andrews
lets go
would like to know what lamar was saying there
thank you andrews youre our blanket
why does gumble keep calling lamar murray
murray is off this year
holy fuck what a fake out by lamar
the bengals defensive ends keep getting to the backfield and just stand there lmao they had an easy sack
they cant stop andrews
andrews got penetrated by the d on that td
and 1
mandrews
there is no way the color commentator doesnt tell him to stop calling him murray when they go to commercial it should stop soon
i like patience lamar
i dont know who this lamar murray guy is or why jackson isnt playing but hes fucking legit
after watching the red river shootout yesterday with the energy of gus and klatt this is like watch a game in a morgue
i never knew lamar did that lol
why does this mans keep saying murray everytime he drops back i though i was going crazy the first few times
lol that was a nice dig at how cheap mike brown is
keep up the pressure d
there was that marlon cornerblitz again
mp
damn mp got hops
burrow having a poor game so far
yeah lamar isnt humble at all come on
peters pressure got to the rookie
juiceman ez pickins
lol
lets go what a defensive play all around
he got that ju ice in him
mp juiceman
now clean your butt off our peters
boom i predicted a peters pick before the game and there it is
mp juicemaaaaaaaaan
murray yet again
thats how you do ittttt
yea thats intentional grounding
got some juice man
noooo
and the turnover streak continues

theres no way thats grounding
wtf was that play
murray peters
when burrows gave that ball back because it was good luck what an amazing person s
lmao what an awful throw
cbs app delay spoilers again not mad though
afc north takeaway division
mp juiceman
inject that into my veins mp juice man
bengals gonna bengal
good job dunlap you ass
ill take the yards but not the play call
the fact that the announcer isnt correcting him just crazy
bengals receiver gave up on the play on that interception but nice play
holy shit he got his name right
murray to mandrews
anyone know the most consecutive scoring quarters to start a season if theyre gonna tell me weve scored in 17 soon to be 18 straight quarters i wanna know the record
the pessimist in me wants lamar to stop going to mandrews so much
green was literally blocking for peters
im confused why wouldnt baltimore take a timeout after that last play and kick a fg
is it just me or is lamar not hitting the holes that he used to
bryant gumballs announcer voice makes it so much more irritating
there ya go
onto the eagles
brown definitely at least a little thicker
i love kyler
rg3 coming out after 1st drive of 3rd quarter is my bold prediction
think our d can pitch a first half shut out
if you send the house like that you got to get to the qb
greg roman just kidding lets abandon the run
our zone d
budget mike thomas lol
theres a game starting an hour from now that i really wanna watch and i was hoping the ravens would have the game won by then its looking good so far
omfg

they said it again
come on d hate leaving dudes wide open
is the baltimore courthouse ready for the influx of ravens players legally changing their name to murray tomorrow
surprised the bengals arent going crazy with the screens
good play bowser
27th ranked pass d
lol judon
judon is having a tough year man
murray playing for both teams now
elliot has played much better than i expected
they cant sack him smh
great pressure there no sack but still lost yards
great rush by judon just gotta finish
excellent defense of that endaround
how does judon miss so many sacks
murray looks like hes playing at 75 but its still great
poo
god i fucking hate tyler boyd
judon loves these games against lesser teams
love the punch on 44
still a good play but judons got to finish that
anyone seeing how joe is doing
did queen slow down a sec when he thought judon had burrow wrapped up
bruuuuuh
queen lost again damn
eagles defense is comically bad
lol mixon ass
sack daddy
peters going off today
asap ferg with the big stop
flag
fuck you judon
fuck you judon
vintage judon
fucking hell thanks judon
who are those lucky ducks
fucking dumbass judon
judon at his best
i feel like once mixon gets up to full speed hes really quick but he really takes a minute to get there when hes running at least whenever im watching he just doesnt really have that burst
its coming back its gonna be roughing the passer
judon better get a solo strip sack or something
lmao elliot dancing after the false start
fuckingnjudon you shithead
i fucking hate judon like seriously man guy is fucking garbage
judon again lol
should be offsetting there was an unrelated false start as well
queen
boom baby what a hit by queen
what a hit gotdamn
ouch judon
queen lit his ass up lmao
lmao anyone see campbells big ass repeatedly jumping in the air
fumble
i truly dislike judon
chuck deserves that man fuck
lol
queeeeeen
yaaaaaaas queen
queen with the sack and fumble recovery
queen just crowned burrow
burrow is off on his deep throws this year
boom bitch
sit the fuck down
stung by the bee
feasting on the rookie qb
yeah i think its safe to say our d is all up in burrows hat right now
yas queen
e tu brute
were relentless my boy
caribbean queen

now were sharing the same dream
wow
damn he killed him

sec quarterbacks
lot of flags today
scott hansen on redzone saying queen and burrow werent friendly at lsu first ive heard of that
lmao we are playing so well i actually feel bad for the bengals
the judon special back at it
anyone else watching the elite dragon at the same time
smh
go for it
bruh dont go for this
ooof
dude
wasted
fuck
bad decision coach
no respect for burrow by going for it there lol awful execution tho
lamar too excited another skyball
well that didnt work
idk what that was
why fucking why my dude
garbage inconsequential play calling
should have punted there we are up 17
wish we gave tucker a shot at a huge fg tbh
dumb 4th down call
great play by defense just to get a false start and throw 4 times in a row for no reason
what the hell was that about no reason to go for it there
i swear some of you see the buzzword of playcalling and then scream it the whole time
yeah thats coming back
then again lamar did miss 2 days of practice were stomping the bengals i dont see them scoring more than 2 tds but we gotta clean this shit up next week philly will be a better team and their confidence will sky rocket if they upset the steelers
that was the right playcall by cincy just their oline sucks so much and messed it up haha
roman has to run the ball more
we need like 10000 fans back
lol the entire ravens sideline saw that
is that the 1st holding call for the year
well that helps with the old field position
170arrest greg roman
burrow bout to need an xl ice bath after this game
bengals might want to take burrow out before he gets killed
this is why we went for it lol we smell blood in the water on d
shit might as well pour maple syrup on burrow because he is getting pancaked yikes
im so glad bobby hart plays for them
did j tucker not kick a field goal cant watch the game
steelers getting help from the refs again
who tf is jbalvin
wait the run works
wow back to back runs
yeah were monsters
are they rotating mekari and powers or was mekari hurt for the last 2 drives
jesus lamar just threw that away the same way burrow is
woahhh easy killer
so are we getting a lamar run like last year against the bengals
gus bus
the truest 5050 ball ever
andrews owes it to lamar lol
not huge on lamars decisions today get it out of your system now its just the bengals
opportunity to put this game to bed with a td here and again coming out of the half leggo
our defense is looking phenomenal this game burrow has actually been playing decently this year until now
if you want the hot delicious taste if pizza hut delivered this bad dude i promise you nobody wants pizza hut this bad
lol case in point look at that run
i was wondering where dobbins was
damn that ball was there
holy fuck dobbins
dobbins
finally dobbins gets a touch
god damn miles boykin literally blocked his man off the field on that jk run lmao
dobbins another player who always produces but rarely gets a chance
damn stayed in bounds forever then got out of bounds
bengals are fighting for their lives somethings gonna give
why the fuck was that
jfc lamar
speaking of givingsighs
i dont know what dpi even looks like anymore
welp
awful throws
what the fuck
what the fuck
ugly throw
lamar has gotta be hurt wtf is he doing
what is lamar doing
is it just me or has lamar seemed unhappy this season
how the heck do we start off so hot and then revert to this
that wasnt gonna make it to snead no matter what
lamar looks awful today but him not absolutely dominating teams will hopefully be good in the long run
jesus christ what the fuck is that lamar is just not playing well right now
it looked like that ball just slipped out of his hands
garbage inconsequential playcalling
that was a terrible ball any way you look at it
what in the actual fuck were you throwing that ball for
that one highly confuses me imma just give him the benefit of the doubt here lets get the ball back
how many times are we going to allow a free rusher off the right side jesus christ
the bengals have to be awful for us to be winning like this with lamar playing this poorly
tf
what was that throw tbh lol
cant be mad at that it was just a good defensive play
look at orlando bruh
lamar is getting frustrated he should keep his cool in these situations

id prefer a game like this then a full blown out then fail at the playoffs
lets try this again shall we ladies and gents
lol its glaringly obvious lamar needs to run the ball more himself run with rpo and throw very minimally in order to be successful
idk wtf roman is doing throwing out of the shotgun with him all game long
both teams doing a good job putting pressure on the qb
we got the ball back already lets go score
is gilchrist the new corey graham
nice pick up for hollywood
defense is playing hardnosed ravens d even with the offense playing meh
well 1 minute left the ravens do score a lot of tds in the last 2 minutes of the first half

gotta look for some positives here
kneel it go cool off come back out after the half

nvm didnt see cincys tos
what the fuck is this playcalling
take a shot deep
in what fucking world does stanley start that sack by shuffling inside instead of outside what the actual fuck
get a field goal maybe
this is tucker range right
pleaseee let tucker kick a long field goal
anyone have a good stream
61 for tuck
no bueno
noooooooooooooo
medstar sucks
trade tucker scrub


this game should be over already
how dare u ruin fleetwood mac like this
they really fucked up but not just running it to give tucker a shot at the record there with it right in the middle of the field would love to see tucker have the record for longest field goal made
i cant believe we had 29 passing attempts in the first half of a game where we arent playing catch up
ard 99yd pass td to hollywood pad those stats
also if teams are blitzing all the time to try and stop lamar give him some short throws that he can complete quickly
weird game our d has been great though
rain time
what do the bengals need to work on on offense uh everything
the eagles are literally garbage why cant we get any help
teams have had a year of film and a whole offense to look at this offense they have to add new wrinkles it can be tough to find a balance between imposing your will with your bread and butter and adjusting to taking what the defense is giving you
maohmesesque
this offense is offensive
this is frustrating
lamars risky passing is like my childhood crush toying with my heart
i think the problem is our receivers suck at getting open and he tries to keep the play alive as long as possible
we are still just missing that big 1 wr we can try and force passes to once in a while
did we switch announcers or am i crazy
ok im sorry i like watson but that commercial was fuckin dreadful
i see you ferg good game so far
anyone have a link on where to watch this game south texas here no where available even at a bar
that speed
thank you defense
gilchrist playing deep safety lol
youre a queen what
i feel like at the very last moment burrow sensed a defender coming if not that was a fumble
yikes bengals look awful in pass pro that rep was on mixon however a vet qb tells him where the blitz is coming from there
how many times has our offence had the ball this game
i hope all the extra passing attempts this season have just been jackson trying to make up for no preseason games
106
so many tipped passes
run the fucking ball
murray again
murray
murray up the middle
he finally recognized it why do i keep calling him murray
its raining and we are still throwing
why do i keep saying murray
id like to know our runpass on 1st down today gotta be like 70 pass at least
anyone got a link to the game
i am appalled with this offense
more dobbins more duvernay
this ref is high as shit
hollywood
there we go
good call lamar if his knees hurt im glad he didnt run it like he wanted to
and lamar is def not 100
hollywood
beautiful play defenders bit on the scramble
nice play hollywood
cant figure out why hollywoods release after catch is slow hes so quick but he catches the ball turns up field looks around then runs
everytime he calls lamar murray lamar makes a big play

lol
get out of the way ref
well that was something
another free rusher
lamars leg looked fine there
that play is broken a second time he turned to fake to ingram but ingram was no where near him
wtf is the ref doing also another pass play roman wtff xd
that poor ref
official thought he was not in the play he thought wrong
keep passing the ball up 17
uh can we block
embarrassing
we havent scored since the 1st quarter right thats ridiculous
they call a running play that gets 3 yards and greg roman thinks its the end of the world
lamar needs to scramble more so many times he has open lanes but ends up throwing an incompletion
the bengals have kept tabs on that rollout all game bad playcall on 2nd and long
whywhy is offense so stalled lately
come man run out of that pocket we needed 6yds
lmao
damn couldnt fall on that one
fuck fuck
dammit we couldve had that just dive on the damn ball
strip sack omg get the football
what was that hot potato
why wasnt dez signed
lmao
burrow fumbles more than lamar did his rookie year good lord
who the fuck put the ball in butter
just fucking fall on it
a run
yea big boi
nice run hes gonna call a pass after this watch
run good more run
big boi
big truss
they ran on 2nd and 7 g ro thank god
wow we ran it and it worked

now keep doing it pls
finally something from ingram
i think its safe to say yandas spot is still up for grabs
lamar has 3 yards

i must have missed it
these dudes trying to get a strip ball they aint marlo
imagine that running the football
skilled boy no washedup boy
hmm maybe we should run the ball more
see what happens when you run the goddamn ball greg
marty was the oc in 2018 not roman
open up the bag now an endaround a play action a screen
anybody got the stats on edwards ypc
what
more playing time for duvernay less for boykin
this fake crowd noise is trash

washington is gonna kill alex smith bro
who is this gilchrist cat
burrow getting killed
ferguson is looking nice he fast
judon again
fucking judon
how has madbukaki looked today
pain
i just want yall to know that the german translation for poor sod is armer sack and i think this perfectly fits for joe burrow today
chucky
dan dierdorf rich gannon as a commentator

this sucks because were going to have to hear this dude commentate on games for the next decade at least
sack squad
poor burrow
rip burrow
what a defensive effort
fuck yeah sacked again get hit boi
defense definitely destroying today
whats the max sacks in a game just curious
thats not ray rice
we should try to make a move for curtis samuel he is so underated because carolina doesnt use him i think he coukd be a number 1 super diggs like
remember this game when you think its a good idea to trade an elite lt
i really like to see our d line just playing mean
okay granted bengals o sucks but maybe this is the game that really gets our d going ya know
just get one more td so we can ice this fucking game
big run mark
what
wtf
5 different db have a sack today unreal
luckiest drop ever
brown and andrews are doing their thing but someones going to have to step up every now and then
run the damn ball
run the damn ball
i just hope both teams run on every play now end this damn garbage
bruuuuuuuh
love how hump always comes in with a punch
marlon straight assaults arms out there
whew nice route
yeah because the collisions are as bad if not worse than car crashes
anyone else really annoyed by the crowd moaning
when hes not being driven into the ground burrow is moving the football
what was this sub saying about
lamar last year week 5 against the steelers
what the fuck is wrong with them lmao
wow
hahahahaha
wew
thats fun
there u go
what a weird game today
no 1st work for it
how is that not a penalty
nice
nope
the worst part is 623 instead of 555 on the game clock
thats not gonna save me rich no it certainly isnt
cc just tackled both of em lol
suck it ebron
i hope he fucking shanks this one just to have the shutout
can we run up the score now that we dont get the shutout
why did we need rgiii to take a knee
who even wins the nfc east
i mean ill gladly take a touchdown but that drive hardly inspired confidence
omg its nothing wrong with the call to go for it or the play call lj mised the throw

and shut up about running the ball theyre not as good at running the ball as they were last year

theyre up by 17 good grief
score should be much higher to everyone saying were complaining roo much stfu this performance will not be sustainable against good teams
ravens up 200 and everyone in this sub is having a melt down like we are the jets pull it together guys
mahomes went straight to the locker room like a little baby classless and shows what a little btch he really is classless in winseven more in losses
come on yall we scored a td on opening drive almost every game last year its unrealistic to expect it every single game we will be fine
are we still listening to analytics becuase i think analytics wouldve said dont go for it there
if we move on from greg roman were not gonna have a coach that can adapt the current running game to whatever system they try and lamar would suffer because of it
3 straight passes lol
26 pass attempts is inexcusable
i wanna see koch under center for the rest of this game lol
something is off with lamar
good thing were playing this shitshow of a qb because this is easily our second worst game this year
ingram has 2 good runs and suddenly everyone thinks hes great again lmao
flacco td though wooo
like i said before and got down voted for the offense is garbage lamar refuses to scramble roman refuses to run on first and second down the only reason were winning is because the bengals oline is as bad as ours
i dont have a good feeling about next week
streaming link anyone please
he cant do that all game keep up the pressure
i really think hollywood is hiding an injury
id this dumb asshole calls jackson murray again
judon is pathetic
stupid if anything should have run it
smh lamar
what the fuck is wrong with lamar he is awful today throwing
sigh maybe one day the ravens will remember that their running game is better and more crucial to their offense than their passing game
nt
lamar looking decent this drive he just having a off day
nice to see us running only 13 times in a half maybe if we ran more it would open up some more plays through the air instead of lamar having to look for someone to get open and forcing something
i want to see more of the ravens running uptempo going forward frustrating as that pick was i thought the offense looked better running it it keeps the defense on their heels forces their rushers to either commit to coming downhill to rush or hanging back to contain instead of being able to take it one play at a time wears down the dbs to let hollywood and duvernay put that 43 speed to its best use makes the backfield motion even more confusing and wears down the whole defense so once lamar takes off theyve got even less of a chance of catching him

dont become like chip kellys eagles and run nothing but uptempo slow it down as the game dictates but i liked how the offense looked running at a faster pace plus then it wont be as uncomfortable on the rare occasions we have to play from behind because we already know how to run hurry up
wtf was that roman
we should get someone besides rg3
honestly brown needs to man the fuck up steve smith wasnt big but he laid people the fuck out on these plays
i really want to see roman gone after this season terrible passing routes terrible play calls he just doesnt have it he makes winning look hard
somethings off with burrow this year

jfc s
i have zero respect for greg roman
3rd and 3 lets throw the ball
bengals have a terrible run d even when they have dj reader and hes not on the field just run it down their throats and finish this game
time for joe boller
reddit is full of people with negativity bias
first shutout of the season is close
i agree with lamar being not 100
eagles are blowing it as usual
i kinda want us to throw it dont kill me
dick sucking for getting sacked give me a break
that pass was awful havent seen one that bad from lamar since his rookie year
lamar has been ass the past 3wks but he is actually making bad decisions this game clean it up bra
damn did i wander into the cincy sub by accident all this negativity early toward our own guys when were moving the ball chill kids
dont agree with going for it
that was fucking stupid
i love the ravens and lamar but i believe he lost something after this latest chiefs loss
lamar vince young jackson is back
all you people saying the halftime analysts havent been watching the game have you ever thought maybe just maybe the ravens arent playing nearly as badly as you think they are
looks like the bengals made their halftime adjustments
lol both qbs playing bad atleast we winning right fellas hehe
i fucking want the bengals to score to test our offense rig now
people need to be more positive lots of good stuff in this game to be happy about lamar throwing a lot might be in response to the bengals scheme and not roman being a moron keep your heads up ravens bros and gals
tuckers not looking so hot today
antonio brown
only in rravens could you find fans crying about being up 170
trade for allen robinson julio hell at this point ab not looking to badf
not going for it
convincing
lamar is having a sophomore slump

bozeman is having a day
think its going to be closer than we all think burrow is legit
marquise brown mark clayton
r u n

t h e

b a l l
stop giving ingram the ball
rgiii time
we spent a third round pick on miles boykin sigh
judon is my least favorite player on this team
offense shouldnt have had a free play by rule they shouldve blown it dead thats just refball and not on any player in particular as they wouldve called something else
horrible call
wtf roman punt the fucking ball lamar had a few shocking throws that drive but still do not like that playcalling one bit
looked like andrews didnt get the right release there wish they had a replay or sunday ticket let me rewind

ray rice
idk if lamar can read pass defense well
lamars worst game since the chargers first half in the wildcard

what is going on
not enough time to get tucker close
please run the football consistently in the second half im on my knees begging you roman
yeah sack his ass
my prediction there will be changes in the bye week to address the lackluster run game until then we will see lamar passing 30 times a game
lamar throwing the ball while were up by 17 bruh cmon
wtf is lamar doing
thats it roman literally never pass it again in fact lets not put a qb in just a backfield of running backs
thank god we ran him for 2 yards or else you guys would be up in flames
all ofnourboutside runs require cut backs to get any yardage we need to move to a more conventional offense
queeennnnnnn
queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
geez at least mark the ravens side of the game balls
pathetic just absolutely pathetic with this kind of defensive domination and our run game once again flourishing when given the chance we should be leading this 500 170 is just pathetic at this point
brown is a huge softie
screw it were up by 20 mcsorley time
lamar hasnt looked good since week 1
lamar isnt playing good so put in mcsorely to clean everything up

people dont understand jokes in this sub lmao
boys i hate to say it but the madden curse is very real and its got our boy

im staring to feel bad for burrow if we score this drive i hope he gets some momentum the next drive
dude i might just turn this game off lmao gg yall
im very much irritated right now whats going on what happened to the ravens being a revolutionary runfirst offense roman please
at this point im thinking harbs is waiting to release jk and gus at the forefront until later in the season to preserve them
if we pass before 3rd down at any point in the second half im gonna be so pissed off
shouldve just started rg3 lamar obviously isnt 100
jesus christ someone was open enough its the nfl lamars pass just lasered out at 100 mph and didnt even give the receiver a shot

literally wtf is our offense right now
fuck man

does lamar have covid
orlando brown got beat on that pass hes really having a rough stretch here
we know we can run i say keep passing
fake
this game is way too close i know its unlikely but if the offense doesnt get it together and the defense slips a couple times they could come back
bengals are gonna be so much better this year
removed
removed
lamar aint helping the narrative that he cant throw
lamar couldnt hit the water if he fell out of a boat
proche has done nothing as a returner
holy shit i think im cheering for burrow to play well

guys help me
our offense is terrible

lamar seems determined to be a pass only qb and its showing
theres zero chance the raiders win this

nice coverage 100 million dollar man
why is judon is fuckin zone coverage in the middle of the field like a fucking safety

i cant stand either of these coordinators
butker is automatic from anywhere in the field

just missed from half field


removed
removed

getting it first makes sense with the ravens cant win from behind narrative too bad their offense sucks donkey dong
am i crazy or is this old fuck calling lamar murray every other play
i came here to see if anyone else was hearing murray can someone cbs on twitter and let em know we aint got murray playing
he definitely is
just did it again my guy prepped for the wrong game
ljs mom needs to get on twitter and get them straightened out
is a weird tick he has because he only says murray during the play once the play is over he says jackson hopefully their producers say something to him during the break
i think this guy is drunkhigh so many mistakes today
nah its every play
gumbel has been terrible and he usually doesnt bother me he also said complete right after ljs interception and then just went dead silent for 10 seconds before gannon corrected him and gannon called one of ljs weird misfired passes a coverage sack just horrible announcing
so its not just me then every single drop dropback it seems
how in the hell do you do this to the reigning mvp this is some matt schaub shit
his producer needs to be correcting him
inexcusable that its going on this long
i want a super cut of every time he said murray
i literally only came here to check if anyone else was heading this lmao
it was sorta funny the first time now its just incredibly distracting
came here to complain about this lol
how have all of us noticed and none if their production these announcers are horrible
the pass is complete





the pass was intercepted

yah my b the pass was intercepted
hahaha yup
driving me crazy he has said it 7 times
yeah its nuts
i kept hearing him called marquise brown marcus too he has been so bad
a grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says hey we have a drink named after you

the grasshopper says you have a drink called murray

sorry
edit sorry it is greg gumble

edit 2 i think someone finally told him our work here is done reddit
is greg gumble not harlan harlan would never he is the goat
its because hes a gibroni
yeah its gotten pretty annoying hes done it like 5 times now
greg gumbel is the playbyplay guy today not harlan
i know driving me nuts he has said it at least 8 times
the fuck was that throw
thanks
update he just did it again i think hes highdrunk
why does keep referring to greg gumble as kevin harlan on this reddit thread
dont slander the great name of kevin harlan
humphrey is the goat
with dan fouts retirement gumbel gannon inherit the dementia
getting old
who cares why does he keep calling lamar murray it is driving me crazy

thought it was a louisville throwback for a quick second
i chuckled
greg gumbel is going senile change my mind
arizona cardinals louisville cardinals baltimore bird team black qb lamar murray

thats the best i could come up with
gumble is now apologizing lol he knows hes had a bad day

its not his first bad day
and rich gannon saying marcus peters was renowned for his ability to force fumbles next play humph forces a fumble do they actual do their research
quality crappost have an upvote
why do we always get the worst commentators
speaking as a football fan a lamarkyler super bowl would be tasty

speaking as a ravens fan pass
i love murray
oof
my homies decided to make it a drinking game every time he said murray ended up having to crack more than one beers
best qb ever

just a scrimmage developing both qbs both are coming along well
good game as well i hope burrow balls out for you guys

making his case for droty playmaker
thank god the packers drafted a qb
ball dont lie baby
he cracked joe with so much vengeance
i havent watched anyone else except for the seahawks defensively is he leading the roty race
at this point i dont see any reason to pay him long term he needs to step up in a huge way over the last three quarters of the season if hes trying to earn a deal so far it looks like hes just going through the motions knowing full well were planning to let him walk
he really needs to put up numbers to get a worthwhile landing spot

i dont think wink hasnt been especially helpful in his schemes either
at this point i actively dont like him hes good for a bone headed penalty each week usually on third down and he cannot finish his sacks mahomes is one thing but burrow foh dude i wish we had someone better than him to bench his ass for but unfortunately we do not
why would he go through the motions if hes trying to get paid if anything he would try to ball out and sign a huge contract with the jaguars or something hes just not executing in a contract year
on a day we got 7 sacks our no 1 pass rusher got a grand total of 0
because he sucks why is it so hard for people to admit judon is ass cheeks

oh no


he stole ajs voodoo
he was wide open
im happy to see lamar getting better as a passer but it feels like we are slowly loosing our mean pound the ball offense identity
we need to establish a passing game and get some scary deep tape up
i have no clue i think the coaches are using these games to improve lamar as a passer when the game is kind of already won

but lamar is missing passes he should make am i worried not really but at the same time its not really great to see
lamars accuracy seems to have taken a step back i have no facts on this just the eye test
i mean the success we had last year running isnt sustainable especially losing yanda

that being said the play calling by roman these last few weeks has been questionable at best

also dont forget lamar missed 2 practices this week hes clearly not 100 im not really worried about it

that being said did the coaching staff forget about dobbins
idk im a little worried if lamar is still making poor decisions throwing the ballstarting to loose my patience
where are you seeing lamar getting better as a passer
yanda retired

gg onto the next one

oline needs to heal up and our downfield passing game looks god awfulborderline non existent even against the bungals we will never win any meaningful games against good teams by running it
pay the man

i dont care if its us or another team the man deserves a big paycheck and a starting role in this league
it better be us
we want the gus bus till the wheels fall off

1010 shitpost

the ravens have the best kicker in the nfl this guy is money recognition tucker deserves

edit well fuck 61 is far as hell though

ive never seen anything like it lamar has thrown it 28 times like were getting stomped out by the chiefs again
hopefully well add another panel at the bottom saying keep passing to practice for the playoffs or sum shit haha
abandoning the run after a false start and now starting the drive at 1st and 15
the playcalling and play design continues to be questionable as fuck were doing well but bengals just keep giving us short fields for fucks sake even the raiders have already put up 24 on the chiefs yall are gonna say im overreacting but roman needs to go and we need to hire someone else this shit is getting extremely annoying
i listened in on q and sarah ellison post game and q said he thought it was maybe a get some live reps type of situation
i see the passing as a way to help lamar improve narrative but in a run first offense you run to set up the passing game when we abandon the run we never set up the pass game have little success passing and overall see morale decline i can see it on lamars face every time hes on the sideline hes not having fun like last year and this could actually be shattering his confidence
im ready to move on
i think this is a result of both life without marshall and lamar being hurt if were trying to limit lamar then we lose the read option which is our most efficient play imo running without yanda well that doesnt need much of an explanation

we need to chill and let lamar really get healthy hes not running his throws are off id be all for letting him rest for a week or 2 groin injuries are a total bitch

herbert joe burrow
bengals o line is player of the game
theyre getting to lamar far too often and if its not fixed itll be the teams achilles heel teams will be watching and far worse it could lead to a lamar injury
you lost the hall of fame glue guy in yanda

it doesnt look great but you hope it improves as the season goes on
yeah we do need to retool a bit
offense is playing like i do in madden just trying to get good stats against a bad team and failing miserably though its kinda smart if they are trying to work on the passing game against a bad team we cant continue winning only one way
we need lamar to do oline adjustments and hit the hot reads oline might be average but lamar isnt helping

holy shit
removed

anyone have a clip of this

someone
the bengals have done a good job at stopping murray on the ground today
he never said kyler so kinda dumb
im sorry guys but im not a believer in greg romans offense any longer he cant scheme these receivers and i refuse to believe its the wr room the offense looks so difficult they cant complete easy 5 and 6 yard passes consistently theyve invested in the rb room but arent making meaningful runs on downs that matter its time for a new offense
hes a ground game master that appears to have abandoned the run
i just dont understand why hes always so eager to move on from whats been proven to work for our team he did the same thing under the niners offense hell bust out a leaguebest offense one maybe two years and then immediately become complacent
imagine if we had kubiak at oc right now
the wr corps is lacking this has been an achilles heel for the ravens for a decade i wish waller hadnt had a drug fueled breakdown after we drafted him but he did we really have no deep threat that teams are scared of im not a fan of 15 but because of the relationship lj has with 15 he continues to throw to him these are wasted downs we need a true no 1 receiver like dj medcalf or julio we cant go to a sb with a 59 wide receiver

got eem
its a shame he hasnt lived up to his potential will be happy that hes one less player that we have to give a big boy contract too
terrible effort on this post

fumble 6
i love this defense give patrick droty already all proooo money man marloooooooooo thank god for this defense cause the offense has been mediocre today
the defense murdered them i cant say i enjoyed watching joe get handled like that tho
pass rush was good today i mean it was against a piss poor oline but im glad they did what they were supposed to do
queen droy

marlo dpoy

duvernay oroy

jackson sb mvp


real talk cause the first two are the most likely have the droy and dpoy ever came from the same team

i know the saints had oroy and droy with kamara
i feel like ive said enough
i realize im super biased but any chance he gets a couple votes for dpoy

guy hasnt given up a touchdown all year
3 ffs in 5 games
dude is unreal his extension seems like a bargain
its gilmore white and marlon then everyone else
dpoy
yes roman deserves criticism for play calling and i get that but another reason both the passing game and lamar have looked shoddy lamar isnt taking whats in front of him he looks for the big play too often there have been tons of times today and over the course of the season shallow crosses and drags are open and lamar throws into coverage instead sometimes it works but often times it doesnt they need to work with him into taking whats readily available as opposed to always looking for the big play
its true but thats like 3 or 4 plays roman just doesnt design good passing plays he uses boykin as a decoy to run downfield like 70 of the time and still the only wr who even gets open is hollywood lamar isnt having his best game right now but roman is starting to show why he keeps getting fired from his other jobs
running the ball opens up the big play my friend
lamar looks like hes trying to stay in the pocket and prove he is a traditional passer regardless of whether thats the case or its playcalling or hes hurt he hasnt looked good lately
lamar was sick this week and missed 2 practices he looked bad today but ill let it slide this one time
i completely agree but i would like some more creativity out of roman more motions different formations or maybe let lamar call some audibles at the line change up the play you rarely see him do that i do agree lamar does throw deep a bit too much and sometimes the deep throws arent near the wr he needs to spread the ball more throw some short routes anything miles boykin i think can be such a great wr but he doesnt get the opportunities
its not all on him this offense has been sleep walking since week 2

1 lamar is extremely inconsistent


2 right side if the line is a joke


3 we are very predictable when we pass


4 lamar cant handle blitzes at all


5 ingram clearly lost a step


6 wrs cant get any seperation unless its schemed including hollywood
man i cant buy this take even though i want too cause i like roman

there is zero reason why you cant put out mandrews brownduv boylericard ingramgus and dobbins and just cram the ball down the defenses throat

all of them catch all of them block all of the backs lamar can run

not one defense has shown signs of being able to stop our run game so run it dont hide it they know its coming the whole league knows its coming for 15 seasons and they cant stop it unless we give it up it doesnt matter run it

and while were at it run it and no huddle that shit so the defense cant substitute the whole first half of the game you want to get creative ingram and dobbins can both split out a la rice brownduv can end around even boylericard can catch on a screen or something

seriously let our oline eat on the run game like they are built to do let them lean on a dline for a half and then when the other offense has only had 7 minutes of ball time in the first half down 21 if you want to pass and work the pass have at it but the first time you 3 out you better go back to running that shit

i get its easier for other teams to run out of 11 and we are trying to do that more but we arent feasting on being like other teams we were the team that didnt want jackson at receiver we were the team that put a while offense around him we are not the team that does what everyone else does

run roman run

nice of an old teammate to escort him to the endzone
that play highlights what i love about queen he may not be in position all the time but damn if he isnt at least the second ravens there to helpmake a play
anyone else recognize another play with the bengals based on the field position

marlon is the best db in the league
consider the queen for droy campaign started
41 is still 41 need to clean up some things for when we play pittsburgh

edit whoa thanks for the gold
i think its getting safe to say that judon will not be getting a long term contract from us
that wasnt lamar we saw today that was murray
lamar seems to want to show he can throw deep but keeps throwing into double coverage its insane
defense good

offense bad
anyone else see lamar limping post game bye week cant come soon enough
very flaccoesque victory today

yknow the scariest thing about this ravens team is how we are still crushing the other team despite how mediocre our offense is playing albeit being two of the worst teams in football these last two weeks its still somewhat promising to know that we havent peaked yet
im hoping the odd playcalls are because roman wants the guys to get live passing reps against a weaker team since there was no preseason

great game by the d
ok so i know im supposed to talk about how shitty our offense played and how this the shittiest blowout win you could have maybe its because people like watching offense more than defense overall but our defense played so phenomenal that i hope more people talk about that this is honestly one of the best defensive performances i have ever seen not exaggerating and it reminded me of old school ravens football that is something more people should be happy about and not take for granted there is still a reason why we blew them out even if it wasnt the typical blowout
i think lamars knee is bugging him more than theyre telling us he looked uncomfortable all day
fuck u chiefs

thank you raiders
defense the real mvp
patrick queen is really gonna be a ravens legend huh

edit thank you for gold my first ever
why cant roman just run the fucking ball against a porous run d theyre trying to turn lamar into something hes not overnight instead of taking incremental steps and its hurting our offense
im sure this was mentioned in the game thread but why the hell did roman call the game like we were losing once we went up 170 there is no excuse for lamar to throw the ball almost 40 times against the bengals
the defense is starting to coalesce some of our young guys had big days great to see

the offense is going in the opposite direction they have no identity or cohesion greg had a couple bad playcalls but was decent overall imo

lamar on the other hand was awful 6 interceptable passes 3 thrown right to the defender 2 happened on b2b plays his decision making has never been worse than it was today he was very sloppy with the football he looked like he wasnt prepared for the bengals scheme imo his 2 days of missed practice factored in here look for him to have a bounceback game next wk if he practices

the offense has way too many miscues as well the tape from this game will be horror show worthy on o

hopefully the offense gets some practices in and figures it out
greg roman needs to get his shit together there is zero fucking reason lamar should be throwing the ball 37 times in a blowout win
defense
marlon makes plays period contract looking better by the week rest of the d not looking too shabby but cincy has some pass protection problems even with burrow holding onto the ball too long sometimes our oline problems still persist and lamar is trying to do too much 41 still and with some work to do
that offensive performance does not give me any confidence this is a shitty take for a 273 win with a lights out defensive performance but man

edit thanks for gold birdbro
from the looks of this weeks game thread was it a blessing in disguise that i wasnt able to watch this game lol
defense was fucking scary today

offense was disappointing but hopefully it was mainly because lamar missed some practice
money bag marlooo
defense

thank you
someone in this thread is confusing the guild button for the upvote button lol

im really proud of our d today especially humphrey and queen but we still have to figure out how to call passing plays and greg please run the call more its our greatest strength
i mean the offense can only go up from here right
will receivers ever be safe from marlon humphrey is there even a chance they figure out how to defend themselves from the dreaded fruit punch

wow my first gold thanks
every team in the north is getting better on offense and were still trying to figure it out i know last season was kind of similar but i dont think we have much time to waste gotta get it together and quick ay least the defense looks great outside of playing kansas city
who thinks its time for duvernay to start over boykin yea g roman needs to figure something out as far as an offensive scheme lamar got real lucky the bengals defenders didnt feel like catching the picks he was throwing today please can we for the love of god run the ball more

thank god for marloqueen and the rest of the defense good defensive win offense better fix its self soon we got a bunch of tough games upcoming
either our pass plays are designed horribly or lamar is having trouble passing hoping its the former
i feel so bad for joe mixon
what a fucking putrid offensive performance that score should have been in the high 50s this kind of shit wont cut it agajnst the steelers and the tits and the chiefs

lamar must be sick or some shit im worried aout him man why the fuck did they keep him in the pocket so much

edit thank you for the gold
lb patrickqueen living up to the hype as a first rounder gdowning14


check out these stats through the first 5 games

42 tackles
2 forced fumbles
2 sacks
1 fumble recovery
1 td
he rushed for 3 yards because he is hurting a bit right
lamar limping at the end of the game hes still hurt happy with the w
the offense needs serious help if theyre gonna beat playoff teams
fuck the jets back to back great td throws from flacco dropped
fuck the eagles

on a happier note the raiders are beating down the chiefs
this game was a shutout wont accept otherwise one of the most dominant ravens defensive performances in team history

three ff five dbs get sacks defensive touchdown less than 200 yards allowed

absolute dominance ravens4dummies
mahomes threw picks and lost the game they should cut him right guys
offense was really bad i kept hoping they would get it together this game and it just got worse and worse lucky only to have one int
7 sacks today
uithinkmydogiscool how much money have you spent gilding all of these comments lol im so confused
we didnt get shut out

i want to die
i will never be disappointed by a 24 point win with no injuries hope they can get the passing game back on track but the defense is showing up every game but one
why does everyone have a gold
so quick question the chiefs are losing to the raiders so who should they fire according to you guys
anyone else think lamar was limping with the shot of him walking on the field at the end
defense good offense bad
happy bout the win and disappointed in the offense way too much talent to only put up 14 on this team
im convinced roman wants a head coaching a big so hes trying to pad the stats but is failing at it
i didnt think the offense played well and we still won 273
wellwe won but yeesh offense has me concerned
team has room for improvement but we can beat the bottom teams comfortably

need to improve if we want to do anything in the post season
raiders going to beat kc
holy shit what ab unsatisfactory victory bench boykin and sacrifice someones first born child for a legit 2nd3rd option
that last 6 minutes took like a half hour
we are all raiders fans on this blessed day
marlon fruit punch humphrey
imagine if we had jj watt playing today
like the good old days defense carrying the win today
philly better shit the bed when they play us next week
harbaugh said that otaro alaka has a likely seasonending knee injury jeffzrebiec
today its a good day ravens won and chiefs lost party time
i think its pretty clear that they were staying away from the option run with lamar and the offense suffered for it

the dude is clearly not 100 and why force him to run when youre up 17 in the first half
a little concerning but the 2nd half playcalling by roman was just awful
how are we all feeling about hollywood brown moving forward imo he hasnt made a huge impact so far is that his fault is it lamars fault other receivers from his draft class have started to come on lately and im just waiting for him to make his presence felt
raining gold in here
give me gold s
maybe we should hold off on bringing the brinks truck for lamar
our offense makes me want to throw up
chase claypool has more tds today then boykin has in like 20 games lmfaooooo wtf did we do to piss off the wr gods jfc
harbaugh said that it was ol coach joe dallesandris idea to rotate patrick mekari and ben powers at rg team wants to get both experience and fells like they both deserved to play jeffzrebiec
pleasantly surprised seeing ferguson flash at run d still waiting on his sack potential though
why do we keep so many rbs on the payroll if were not going to use them it seems like our roster is setup for the opposite of the plays were calling on game day
before burying lamar keep in mind that his qbr before today was 6th in the league his amount of tds was 11th and his interceptions was 4th least i cant find the updated stats but they will still be good if this is what lamar looks like while being slowed down its not bad

the phantom knee injury is really concerning they can take a long time for normal runners to get rid of i dont know about lamar since he is made of something different but its still concerning
is it just me or does lamar seem not quite as quick on his feet this year in his scrambles

edit just saw in this thread he has an ankle issue did not know that
as a chiefs fan im glad your fanbase is one of the few that isnt putting the chiefs on blast for their horrible game today congratz on the win boys we hope to see you in the playoffs
i watched the ravens game since my lions were off wow yall been fun to watch before but damn is this what its like to be a fan of a good team so much fun to watch
bro joe burrow just face down ass up on the turf while your d just ran train on his supple rookie bussy massive fucking tenderloins lubed up and brined in man sweat slow cooking in his rectum at body temperature until they became rancid and tender enough to not need chewing and then turns around and let them spoon feed the rotten fucking hogslop to him all with a smile on his face great defensive showing
hoping lamars struggles this week can be mostly attributed to lack of practiceknee injury but he has not been in 2019 form since week 1 this year that said he looked pedestrian through the first 5 weeks of last season as well
what a pussy fg by cincy lmfao at least try for a td with your rookie
love this defense
murray present
i wonder how much lamars illnessknee bothered him today he was noticeably off in multiple ways luckily our defense had burrow locked down

edit thank you for the gold
i havent seen anything posted yet about this but anyone curious about lamar not playing at 100 he missed 2 practices this week im guessing thats why they were throwing so much and the lack of option runs
defense looked very solid against a poor offensive team the offense looked very mediocre and lamar looked very mediocre vs one of the worst rush defenses in the league there were flares of greatness but it wasnt consistent like everyone else i think they need to run the ball a lot more and be more consistent i dont have an answer for that it seems like an oline issue to me
if we learned anything from this game its we need better receivers andrews cant do everything we need a true 1 receiver if we want to go deep in the playoffs
its tough to tell how much of lamars regression is due to a nagging injury being worried about a worse oline or something else entirely but i have faith in the team to get something figured out there was always regression coming from an offense like last year remember at this point last year we were 32 and one week removed from being blown out by the browns
queen is king
i said it earlier but there must be a lot of new fans here you have to remember the days of yore testaverde banks redman grback boller when we went to our first super bowl our kicker stover was one of our best offensive producers its in our dna when one side of the team isnt doing great the other can carry us i know last year our offense was so fun to watch but well get there
why is lamar throwing that sloppy sidearm bullshit i dont get it he just looked uncomfortable
congratulations to you guys on another win love you all
just got off work that punch out for the touchdown was the single most beautiful defensive play ive seen in uesrs talk about the concentration and grit from marlon dudes a fucking legend
it is time to move on from boykin
holy shit you beat our asses am i surprised no but i was hoping to put up more than 3 points
i know some may not agree but i think we should get rid of judon and stanley i was not impressed with neither today and some team will be dumb enough to give us a first for stanley and possibly a 3rd for judon and a player idk i could be reaching i would love for us to get two first rounders somehow for next year
to be honest i love that we try different things when we are clearly winning its all free practice

i do think lamar looks less agile somehow or that he forces himself to plant his feed and take the sack get hit i know its ridiculous to think he does it on purpose but something looks off
omg defenses have figured us out were 41 averaging 30 points a game lol

everyone take a deep breath theres a lot of rookies on the team and well click more as the season goes on there was no preseason and a virtual offseason and theyll get better meanwhile were winning games by two possessions or more its fine the chiefs lost to the raiders and the 9ers got blown out by the dolphins we are coasting along pretty well as they improve more
can i have gold
im less upset about losing and more upset about having the trace mcsorley song in my head
amazing game from the defence way to get into burrows head dominate from start to finish

also pretty bush league for taylor to go for the fg to ruin the ravens shut out hes been in the league long enough to know how bullshit that is wink the defensive staff wont forget expect that joke of an offensive line to get dominated in the next matchup too
im thinking somethings up with lamar first missing practice not running today bad reads and the limping in the postgame im smelling an rg3 spot start incoming

interior line is still a problem imo and this game i think showed what we currently have isnt good enough really hope we look into a larry warford but idk how wed make the money work

rbs and secondary are still disgustingly good receivers not named brown or andrews are still not good though duvernay is still interesting
shit performance against a shit team still happened to pull out a win love my ravens but this makes me concerned
not happy with the team no signs of improvement over the last few weeks
lamar hasnt looked good this year might be hurt that frames the question of why we were passing so much

if lamar is hurt why didnt we go run heavy once we were up 170 thats on the coaching staff changes need to be made if we are going to win a playoff game

the steelers will reveal what kind of team we really are we might not be able to score vs their d
whats happened to our rpo offense the one that was kind of good last year
pittsburgh is good like probably better than us right now we need to figure some shit out

week 4 patrick queen

this weeks nominees are
wink martindale

7 sacks 5 by scheming dbs

kept mixon in check

had a shutout till last 32 seconds
entire defense

mainly marlon and queen though god damn hump is insane
ill go with marlon humphrey patrick queen and pernell mcphee humphrey for continuing his quest for this years defensive player of the year award and being the only stealertm ill ever root for queen for being all over the field and coming up big with a sack forced fumble and 2 fumble recoveries something a rookie terrell suggs did 3x in 2003 in addition to his touchdown return and mcphee contributing significantly off the edge by finding his 2014 form today
patrick queen


2 fumble recoveries 1 forced fumble 1 td 6 tackles 1 sack
marlon humphery

playing lights out all season and that punch is lethal
patrick queen again this guy is fuckin good 2 recoveries a td 6 solo tackles and a sack
thank god the ravens secured marlon cause every play would have jacked his price tag to ungodly numbersdeservedly so

but it was nice to see queen and burrow together again at the end of the game
murray

he was dominating in the first quarter played much better than lamar jackson did today
queen
patrick queen

dude played like he was possessed he smelled blood in the water against his former teammate and he balled out with that motivation to see burrow on the ground hes looking better and better rough gamebenching against kc was needed and hes looking like tried and true raven already

entire defense looked amazing marlon gets major props close second for player of the game for me as well as peters mcphee elliott all looked great and contributed as well
bengals oline i know burrow held onto the ball too long at times but that ol is straight trash on fire our pass rush is questionable but that ol got destroyed
defense
dpoy marlon humphrey and droy patrick queen
defense especially marlon mp queen
entire defense except judon
marlon fruit punch humphrey
defense
defense carried us all game offense decided the game was over after the 1st half and decided not to show up
starting dbs they combined for 5 sacks 1 int 1 ff returned for a td and mostly shut down burrow clark also had an int called back because judon lined up out of position

i dont know how to check this but this has to be the first game in nfl history when all five starting dbs had a sack
marlon humphrey queen also had a great game but his td run was set up by marlons punch out
marlon humphrey
im gonna go out of the box here and say tyus bowser felt like dude was everywhere made tons of tackles set the edge well and was in burrows backfield constantly looking like a legit player
defense honorary pick is the drum line
patrick queen
does our secondary have more sacks total than our line
pernell mcphee he dominated
marvin humphrey juiceman
just gonna echo everybody else and say defensehumphrey though low key i thought jimmy smith had a very good game i didnt hear his name called much and when i saw him in coverage he was always plastered to his man maybe thats because he didnt get that many snaps and was given easier assignments but either way it was good to see him execute well im not trying to put him out there as player of the game more just mentioning his effort to make the point about this being a win for team defense
marlon humphrey patrick queen marcus peters and mcphee
marvin humphries
defense

although would not mind giving it to marlon in particular
the baltimore ravens defense they played lights out the whole game
tough between marlon queen and peters i say give it to queen
tie for humph and queen what a steal queen was
marlon humphrey baby
patrick queen hands down

a lot of tackles a sack a forced fumble 2 fumble recoveries and a defensive td

no questions asked
its a hard call between marlo and queen but ill go with patrick queen his whole performance was just super impressive for a rookie
marlon humphrey

special shout out to queen also
marlon humphrey

defense
defense making burrow look like a rookie
as a steelers fan ur entire defense should get the award man yall played a good game
sorry for being late to the party this time around but i agree with the majority that everyone on defense deserves the credit this week

offense though absolutely not
if you had to pick one its gotta be patrick queen he won afc defensive player of the week had an insane stat sheet
lamar

patrick did not force the fumble
marlon forced the fumble what the fuck
give marlon his credit
beautiful to watch

really missing yanda right now and it shows
niners and bills fans warned us roman always does well his first year but the gameplan starts getting stale in year 2 and 3
i want to tell myself that they were just trying out a whole bunch of shit once we were up by a comfortable margin but im not super convinced of that
i think its safe to say hes not going to be in baltimore when the seasons over maybe even sooner if shit goes downhill for us idk if its still super bowl or bust if were being realistic todays play calling was abysmal but were still 41 only reason the steelers are most likely going to be 40 is because they havent played anybody giants broncos texans and eagles
i feel like every game this year roman has either abandoned the run or stuck to it way too sutbbornly
i think its safe to say hes not going to be in baltimore when the seasons over maybe even sooner if shit goes downhill for us idk if its still super bowl or bust if were being realistic todays play calling was abysmal but were still 41 only reason the steelers are most likely going to be 40 is because they havent played anybody giants broncos texans and eagles

burrows going to be a backup in about 5 years if the bengals dont protect him holy fuck that hit that patrick gave him was bad
i watched that man block mixon today using his own tight end absolute unit
calais was such an amazing offseason pickup
just picked off mahomes in the 4th raiders are up 4024
pressure pat mahomes with a 4 man rush we cant do that with our olb
and he almost threw a second sailed over his wr
the first thing i said to my buddy is that the raiders were rushing 3 every time and the chiefs were having a hard time i was begging for wink to do that

interesting to note that the pats held the chiefs without a td for almost 3 quarters all while rushing 34 as well
how to beat the chiefs 4 man rush score 40 points

eagles are trash hopefully we can knock them off easily use the bye for lamar to get healthy and then face pittsburgh at full strength
theyre gonna blow it
see also las vegas
if only the eagles couldve pulled off the upset as well
idk what tf is up with our offense but something needs to change
1 possession game
if i were the raiders id go for it
sigh wtf was that penalty refs and they didnt even show the replay gift wrapped free points for the chiefs
gg lets goooooooo

greg roman is a bus wanker
harbaugh should tell him to plan on the field instead of in the box being bitched at over the mic is way less threatening than face to face
harbaugh wont do shit never does when it comes to coordinators
if we cant turn it around lets go for a younger mind for once
greg is harbs buddy harbaugh wont say anything
greg roman on passing plays lets have one guy run deep and then have all of our other receivers run routes in the exact same place
hes gone by the end of the season hopefully sooner theres a reason why dudes always bouncing around the league

removed
lamar jackson 1937 180 yards 2 td 1 int 719 passer rating

joe flacco 1833 195 yards 1 td 823 passer rating

joe elite dragon super bowl mvp flacco outplayed lamar jackson today
lamar still won
lmao true but what about ws
and they lost by 20 we got the w and in this league it only matters if you win
why do these posts exist

if only the steelers lost fuck the steelers
now we just need to get a pass rush
whats that say about how we played them though
chargers did too
like our coaching staff will do anything different
it seems like every time we beat the bengals the chiefs lose
theres a god lmaoo
it just shows the chiefs didnt beat us we beat ourselves gotta keep stacking wins and show them who will run the afc

that looks just like greg roman lmao
someone please make a roman meme with this

pass coverage aside he is going to be a great addition to this defense granted hell get better at reading offenses and knowing where he needs to be in coverage pissed we didnt get murray but hes proving me wrong
saw a comment saying joe burrow would show lamar how to be a proper qb

yeah he showed him alright
my favorite stat from this week patrick queen had more tds than joe burrow
how tf is chase young on here of he hasnt even played for 2 weeks

i mean it was greg roman lol
if the jets hire roman like theyre rumored to i think we should look into the college ranks and get a new guy with creative ideas
trade him and a 5th to the falcons for jones now that quinn is out jk



why would you target marlon humphrey
and hes just getting started
sometimes i feel like he allows a bit of separation so the qb think the receiver is open and he just comes in and hits the ball out
hes simply a beast even some of the best athletes at db cant transition inside and do what hes doing special player
best cb in football
both marlon and marcus play games with the qb they both like to sit off a bit and try to force turnovers with all of the turnovers hes forced this season already im sure marlo is perfectly fine with being targeted the most

top tier content i knew coming in this would be it and you exceeded

lets see
missed 2 practices
out with an illness
knee injury

better to play trash at the beginning of the year than at the end so please stop with this bullshit
obvious troll post this sub is filling up with trolls disguised as fans spreading negativity were 41 ffs
go back to rbrowns cock sucker
i dint think thats debatable

let me just make a controversial statement and make sure its even more controversial by saying its not debatable
okay
yikes this sub really cant handle even the slightest bit of criticism can it
he had a bad game after barely practicing throughout the week dont make too much of it

this seems like a massive overreaction

and we refuse to incorporate duv more when the other teams have been saying for weeks that all they have to do is follow andrews and hollywood
spread out offensive distribution against philly coming up hopefully

duvernay is a real player its time to get him involved
start duvernay over boykinmaybe convert boykin to te snead has been absent the past couple weeks and i think its time that we start dobbins over ingram we are def feeling the hurt of not having yanda on the oline
jessie bates is a bengals safety fyi
when jk dobbins in the slot is probably the third best receiving option in baltimores offense only because we havent really seen devin duvernay yet in the passing game its extremely difficult for the ravens to rely heavily on the pass like they have been doing

competent teams know if you limit andrews andor brown lamar is going to have trouble trying to get the football to anyone else boyle is never going to beat a defense boykin has been a disappointmenthasnt taken that next step and snead iv has largely been invisible this year outside of the browns game

i know other users were saying that maybe the ravens were testing things out against the bengals where they were trying to get their passing attack going instead of going to the triedbuttrue rushing game however when jackson is still focusing on mark and hollywood for the most part i feel like the result is that there isnt enough talent on the team at the moment to force lamar jackson to beat teams with his arm like at least try to get duvernay and maybe james proche more involved in the offense if you want to pass more but even that hasnt been the case
itll get exploited once we play a real team again
devin durvernay in the slot needs a chance he is explosivehe needs more targets
if he knew that why couldnt he stop them then
not wrong but still fuck you
i honestly think the offensive regress is two fold the obvious being yanda but less obvious being hurst

i think lamar needs multiple reliable tes
this offense is so damn predictable when it comes to the passing game if we dont start getting everyone involved our team is basically going to do this every game bruh fucking baker mayfield looking better than our guy hes throwing to everyone roman needs to go
i dont understand it yall remember that 99 yard drive vs cleveland week 1 here let me remind you of the passing on that drive

lj to ricard for 9 yards

lj to boykin for 25 yards

lj to hollywood for 21 yards

lj to hollywood for 4 yards

lj to snead for 16 yards

mixed into all of that was a combined 21 yards rushing between edwards ingram and dobbins

drive capped off with a 3 yard dobbins score didnt even include duv andrews and boyle

my point we have so many weapons i could be wrong but it seems like he just keys into andrews and hollywood so much

x200b

the two drives vs the bengals today that led to touchdowns was 93 yards combined the offense was not able to move the ball at all against a pedestrian bengals defense something needs to change with the target share sharing the ball is a concept taught to second graders
trade gallup do it edc
isnt the problem arguably more scheme play calling related than specific players being able to get open when you watch other offenses that are doing well they seem to have more variety and deception which allows for big plays we all what happens when lamar is healthy and we have the rpo booming passing alone will never work unless you have the run to set up the pass or at least have some type of creative play calling
we dont have man beaters
duv and proche need to get more reps moving forwards lamar has no interest in throwing to boykin or snead move boykin to te3 and have him run easier routes like slants and drags he doesnt compete well outside the numbers
lamars biggest weakness doesnt give the others a chance no wonder boykin looks dejected and gives up on plays
is ab going to prison if not then lets just have a cup of coffee as a courtesy
ive been saying this since we played the chiefs our pass game is basically brown andrews


isnt it amazing that andrews is getting doubled and hes putting up better numbers than boykins
thats why i dont see the point of a superstar receiver even though i would love one
he and boykin are another planet snead has been invisible think we need more duvernay or ab in week 9
trade dobbins for ceedee lamb
throw to boykin or at least look his way
just take of your own shit
ok
go to bed
how thin does your skin have to be to get so upset about something so trivial as a friendly reddit post

lol raiders still hot garbage
this game is the first time yall have done shit in my life

dont get too big for your britches fella
i know this is a ravens thread so i am expecting bias and i may be biased myself which is why im posting

but is there any corner you would rather have on your team right now not named marlon humphrey he is only 24 locks down every game and forces more fumbles than any corner i can remember seeing im not saying he is the 1 corner in the league but i cant think of anyone i would rather have in my secondary

thoughts on this
marlon humphrey is the best corner in the league there i said it

humphrey gilmore and tre white are definitely 1a 1b and 1c theyre all elite
gilmore and white are a bit above marlon is terms of blanketing a receiver but marlon has a few things going for him that neither of those two can claim 1 he is a playmakerturnover machine 2 he is scheme versatile can play slot and outside at an all pro level

im also a huge fan of marlon in run support but i dont know how white and gilmore are in that area
thank god we paid the guy
patrick soda pop queen

lj cut bucket fort

calais v68 campbell
we dont need nicknames for every player ya know
buddy i have to be honest those are the worst nicknames i have ever heard lmao
wat

why is it not surprising that every fucking db got a sack but matthew judons useless ass has a big goose egg in that column
thats wild
im so fucking dumb for not picking the ravens d on fantasy i picked the patriots d instead im still currently 31 hopefully 41 by tomorrow

i was stuck in meetings this afternoon so i didnt get to watch live but im pumped
mahomes is 04 in weeks where the ravens beat the bengals
i wish i cared about the chiefs losing but until we can beat them ourselves it doesnt matter to me
its never to late woo woo

or maybe its just me
1 lamar obviously isnt 100

2 missing yanda affects the offense a lot

3 looks like ingram has lost a half step i think starting jk and edwards and then throwing ingram in as the fresh legs guy would be the wiser move

4 no 1 wr hollywood isnt a 1 guy duvernay has shown a ton of potential the more he gets put in though if he gets more involved in the passing game as time goes on well be fine

5 greg roman has tried to get way too cute with play calling and his passing schemes arent particularly good
no yanda lamar has been hurt all year no preseason still no number one receiver
my biggest glaring difference is not having 3 tes along with an elite guard yanda to give lamar an extra blocker and more options in the rpo

with an extra te lamar had more time to run through his reads let plays develop and throw accurate darts to multiple receivers or multiple backs or tuck and run for 8 yards getting absolutely silly with defenders

now our playbook isnt as creative or imaginative and greg roman is getting exposed every week even when we win

we desperately need another blocking tight end i mean in the long run getting jk dobbins was a good trade for hayden hurst but it wont take long for defenses to get the better of greg and lamar

our 41 record disguises it and makes us look better than we are but things need to change if were aiming for the chip
the fundamental problem is that our personnel have changed but our play calling and schemes have not the plays that were explosive last year were so explosive because lamar had more time to make reads and pick the best course of action
sign antonio this receiving corp is terrible
biggest issue is jacksonboykins lamar needs to be able to count on him here and there when brown and andrews arent on point and right now thats not happening no one had replaced the roberts yet and he was barely that productive except a few clutch catches playoffs not included

teams are also playing the run very hard

how did ray lewis not have that many games considering he played 17 years with us
not if we dont punt

is it fun

man i love older disney movies i prefer the animation much more

nice use of cock knocker
someone should suggest this as a halloween costume for him then tag mark hamill lol

im more shocked you dont use dark mode in regards to greg roman i honestly have mixed feelings
theyre both positive posts on greg roman who just helped us tie the greatest show on turf 2nd place record of 28 games with 20 points

editadded 2nd quotation mark
needs more complaining about being disrespected by power rankings and announcers
i wish him the best just not with this team same goes for our receivers coach
anyone watch dak get injured and get absolutely sick need to shore up our line so it doesnt happen to lamar
regardless it looked like a designed run the way dak went down kind of reminded me of flaccos slides but it wouldve happened regardless of the oline on the field
that had nothing to do with the oline defender fell on his leg you hate to see it but its unlucky if it was a namath style injury then you can say its oline related
injuries happen no matter how good your o line is they are freak accidents that can happen to everyone
mans just lost a loooot of money
what does the line have to do with this he was 10 yards passed all of them at the sideline
just watched it and eww
think we should all take a minute to send thoughts and or prayers to dak not easy seeing a teams qb being carted off crying
really sucks man im a ravens fan in deep south texas but ive been rooting for dak since he started over romo i hope he has a quick recovery especially with everything hes been dealing with lately my thoughts are with him
good player and good dude sucks to see it happen
that was horrible dak is a great guy who put his heart and soul into that team
i like dak a lot its a shame he has to play for the cowboys because i can and will never root for them but i think its extremely important what dak is doing in terms of promoting mental health
really like dak classy guy and really talented he was absolutely carrying that team and it sucks to a top 510 qb go down like that
that injury was hard to watch i hope he doesnt have any long term effects from it how he left the field was infinitely better than how earl handled it
by all accounts dak seems to be a great human being and an awesome qb good vibes sent his way and hope he heals up soon the league is better with him in it
here is a link to his charity please consider donating
ive never heard anyone say a single bad word about dak as a person even the people that criticize him onfield have nothing bad to say off of it when this stuff happens it sucks regardless of who it is but its the worst when its a genuinely good guy heres hoping hes able to make a swift recovery
funny how life works daks injury happens on the same day as their division rivals qb miraculously returns from a horrific leg injury hope he comes back as well
i mean it sucksbut that can happen when you bet on yourself and turn down 105 million dollars in guaranteed money
if the jones camp doesnt take care of this dude if he never plays again or if he plays again for them then fk the cowboys to the depths of hell and beyond
was watching the game as it happened thought hed just sprained it until they showed a close up
sad year for dak with his brother passing too thoughts for the dude heal up
that was stomach turning felt so bad for him the slow motion replay was like something out of a horror movie

andy dalton is a good backup though hes got a lot of experience as a starter
hope for a speedy recovery
ts and ps for his hopefully quick recovery but on the other side of the pillow our d gets to sack the piss out of andy dalton again this season
im not a fan of the cowboys but i feel bad anytime someone gets hurt like that when the steelers had that player break his neck i felt bad and i hate the steelers
man that sucks so hard its the sprinkles on the shit cake the cowboys have given him over the past year or so
yea that replay was up there with the kevin ware injury replay im surprised they even showed it i feel for dak though i hate to see that happen
jerry jones should be ashamed for not giving him his payday its not his fault the whole team underwhelmes each and every year i hate dallas but i want dak to succeed at the same time
that injury looked really bad im honestly hoping he keeps the foot at this point
and this is why i never fault players for holding out dak thought he was worth a certain price and was absolutely exceeding that this year jerry needs to take care of him
i was watching that game for fantasy purposes i have zeke and my opponent had dak

seeing that injury made me sick man took all the fun out of it

definitely wishing him the best he proved himself to be way better than i ever gave him credit for personally hopefully nothing that will affect his career long term
i have to say after everything i realized this means we face the andy dalton led cowboys next month and i breathed a sigh of relief
another win for that plucky likeable underdog jerry jones
extra sucks in that its kinda similar to earl thomas in seattle hes been trying to get paid for so long now and now he gets hurt and thatll be used against him

who cares we already beat the browns and well see the colts in a couple weeks and beat them too
or alternatively our defense is so good they shut them down
who gives a shit

rbrowns is that way
were going to beat them again
have you seen some of the throws baker has given up to the colts he throws it straight at defenders
they beat the bungles football team and dem boyz calm down
what do you mean reestablished its always been a super competitive division minus the browns but it is about to get tougher

after how we played today we will struggle the next time we face the browns
4 wins vs non competitive teams with bottom 5 defenses
really im not scared of a team who has only beaten up on bad defenses and has a terrible secondary and run defense 41 against bum teams
this time last year we were 32 we werent sure where we were headed or what lamar would become this year were 41 already beaten 2 division rivals and havent even hit our stride yet so long as we keep the ship afloat and dont peak early like last year im fine with this theres a lot of season left and we have yet to get hot im looking forward to 8 weeks from now
cant disagree as it is super early at this point we just need to keep winning and make the playoffs
the guy is 23 years old and we are winning right now if he never shows improvement or if we start losing ill be worried for now though we are getting it done and thats all that matters
im fine with the team just pissed cleveland and shitsburgh keep winning they play next week so one of them should finally take a loss
im confident well make the playoffs win the division and everything what im worried about is if he plays like this against any good team we are screwed
im honestly not sure if this just wasnt a purposefully unusual game plan to get some different work in against a team we felt confident we could handle without playing our best football
also keep in mind that there was a shorter training camp and no preseason too
id like to remind everyone that lamar is 23 years old
every game is something new to complain about we can improve but were not fucking awful
this kind of talk would get you a request to kill yourself in the game day thread today i fucking hate some of our fans sometimes
production doesnt matter only in the big games not against the bengals or subpar teams lj had his production last year and won an mvp now he needs to focus on his passing game fundamentals and decision making and step up his situational passing skills so we can finally throw on good teams with success when we are falling behind

im worried about lamars progression he doesnt look good throwing the ball so far this year seems to have regressed from last year now that teams have his number and our oline is not as dominant he is still very young so maybe with more time he will continue to develop but its getting dangerously close to the point of somethings gotta give

we are spoiled as ravens fans now that our offense is the clear path to success in the lj era everytime i want to scream at lj for throwing ducks or making mistakesi remember the joe flacco era outside of the run game we were always mediocre offensively and struggled in the regular season against a lot of teams good and bad ones however despite his mediocrity the one thing about joe was dude was a winner in the regular season and post season and found a way to play great during our super bowl run it was vanilla ice cream offense but somehow we stuck it out for a long time and became champs and we all know some of those we want tyrod taylor flacco games throughout the years lol the jags game still gives me nightmares and a couple against shatsburgh too

if we could win a super bowl building around joe flacco we should be able to do so building around lj we just have to figure out how to shy away from the run and throw it when we are falling behind against playoff teams and just the passing game in general needs a lot of work

we are lucky to have lj as we were lucky and blessed to have flacco too as crap as he was at times atleast now we are a respectable primetime football team with one of the most electric and fun young qbsand this will always be the silver lining if lj continues to struggle against good teams or in the playoffs

i always love seeing this kind of stuff on the internet still out there

top comment on one of the videos says its from 8 years ago welcoming him to baltimore and hoping he wins the starting job so trippy

meh its all a crapshoot and for 20
frighteningly reminiscent of ray rice

i reeeeeeeally hope he breaks out the second half of the season i mean then what was the point in getting rid of hayden hurst who complemented greg romans 3 te sets so well and gave our offense and rpos so many options

were suffering from haydens departure why not at least utilize our shiny new toy we got for it

i just dont understand
they really need to use him more but im starting to sound like a broken record
he is learning i think a good deal of play calling is used to coach players this year as wellbut im so stoked for him and duvernay he looks phenomenal and those training wheel hand plants are so reminiscent of rr
i really hope he breaks out too hes hungry and patiently waiting his turn he was a top 2 rb in the draft class and for him to not be seeing the field very much its kind of annoying for me personally i love ingram but we needs some new juice in the backfield dobbins is dangerous with the ball in his hands
jk is learning as he doesnt have the benefit of a preseason pass protection and general offensive scheme is still being learned not saying he is ignorant or dumb but lamar having to move him around pre snap is indicative of him not quite being ready
hes a rookie who has played 5 games calm down his time will come next year when ingram walks
i think dobbins would he has been amazing for a rookie i love ingram but he just isnt too good but edwards is doing alright

view poll
either way its clear ingram is the least effective of the 3 but he gets the most carries because the coaches value experience over talent to an almost detrimental degree same thing happened during objs rookie year when he was clearly better than hurst but coaching doesnt give young talent opportunities easily
dobbins is the only one thats dynamic in the passing game and at this point i dont know what ingram brings that edwards doesnt do just as well if not better

give ingram gus current role and free jk
ingram is 46 ypc on 45 attempts almost triple dobbins attempts

edwards is 57 on 34 over double the snaps of dobbins

dobbins is 79 on 16 attempts

who does he get the snaps over you are being ridiculous if you think dobbins maintaining 6 ypc let alone 79 on gus carries
yup i think a 12 punch of dobbins and gus would be perfect
people are forgetting that one of the main reasons why gus is doing so well is because he is coming in after halftime pounding a tired d i think he would still be a decent rb1 but not near the level he is doing now i wouldnt mind trying dobbins as rb1 for a stint though with ingram as backup

delete this piece of shit
plz for the love of god delete
if mods had any balls theyd suspend you


we whooped burrow

damn you right
the cowboys oline is beat up enough he could get sacked as much as burrow was

and matthew judon had zero

rays facemask and bionic arm are absolutely incredible
sure feels good having the defensive torch being carried on
there will never be another 5220 combo in the nfl but if they even draw a comparison that would be just fine with me
i mean that is easily the most beautiful picture ive ever seen

still quite a way to go but i would love it if these two became half of what the terror 5220 was on defense
lets cool it on those takes for a minute i mean patty cake is still a rookie but i would very much like this to be a reasonable comparison come 2023
we havent had a 52 since ray right
ray wasnt a liability in coverage queen is a great thumper but i bet we see more fort than queen against the steelers and bills
this is the feeling that makes you get all tingly and smile
hopefully soon this is one of those thats the same picture memes
ill never be a fan of the actual number 48 it just looks terrible

i dont get everyone shitting on him for not trying to catch the ball unless he has a 10 foot vertical it wasnt gonna happen

the effort he put in after the int though
he doesnt look like he wants to be a bengal anymore
he was benched for this aj green is now on the outside looking in on the bengals crazy
what the hell happened to him
bengals dont deserve aj green they never have but unfortunately that on tape is going to hurt him in free agency no pun intended
this dude literally was running away from the ball after it got intercepted

is he good im kind of concerned
clown franchise should have traded him for picks or ol while they had the chance
after all the pain this dude inflicted on us this past decade i dont feel the least bit bad lmao

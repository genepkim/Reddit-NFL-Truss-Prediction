jim rome said that kyler murray is a more explosive runner than lamar


people are crazy
kyler is a great runner should probably run more often but the stratosphere that lamar is in running the ball is different kyler is lightning lamar is a fucking nuke running the ball just fucks everything up your eyes ankles soul etc
i didnt know jim rome was still alive
its jim rome dudes a clown
what the hell is wrong with people
well his runs are more explosive but thats because his runs are almost exclusively scrambles these will inherently be bigger than designed runs

however lamar is still more explosive but i can see why someone would say that about murrays running
now lamar isnt running enough you say
he just seems more explosive because he has shorter legs and therefore sorter strides makes him look super fast

lamar with his longer strides just looks like hes almost coasting as hes running ie look at randy moss
this season sure overall no way in hell lamar hasnt really gotten it going yet on the ground but i think thats mostly by design teams are terrified of him gashing them for big gains so its been a huge part of their game plan but this offseason he focused on getting better at passing so he doesnt always have to do that and so far its paying off
i guess by some measures he arguably might be i feel like he can hit zero to sixty in a straight line a little quicker maybe but hes nowhere near as elusive and doesnt have the same change of direction as lamar does
maybe but lamars vision and elusiveness is the best a qbs ever had
even if true it only means they are both explosive af
everyone just flocks to the new shiny thing

theyre both awesome but murray isnt the open field runner that lamar is
if you compared him to last year lamar than youre absolutely right something about this year tho granted only 2 games where he just hasnt been running at the same level as last year
rome is a very excitable dude
explosive runner lamar wins

explosive offense sorry guys but kyler has insane receiving weapons and a pretty good rb too
seems like the lack of preseason gamescontact may be catching up to some teams with the insane amount of injuries today hope everyone on both teams both sides of the ball can come out of todays game fully healthy
dont go on rnfl today yall its looking like an obituary page in a newspaper
shoot tavon young is injured you jinxed us
you jinxed us
amen to that lots of casualties around the league so far today no more
rip tavon hype
lets us pray yall
yeahhh id rather lose than win but take as many injuries as the niners have today that would be essentially if we lost lamar dobbins and judon in one half
bless the knees
aged poorly

he is about as wide open as my relationship status jeebus
he played really good well at least until that onside kick
i cheered so hard
its only been two games but hes really breaking out this year good for him
thor
and in the immortal words of bart scott
good
this steelers game is boring af

those kicks are clean might have to cop me a pair
this assures victory
i copped those kicks when they dropped a couple months ago specifically for sundays at the bank theyre cleaner w white laces
fucking love the jords wish i could get me a pair
dripdripdrip
i bought my black lj jersey just in time for last years game vs the seahawksweve only had one loss when i wore that on game day

i got a color rush one now so im passing on the luck of the black jersey to you
love those kicks too
shoes
yoooo that is siick
where did you get those shoes my dude
hype
sick kicks

dumpster fire
lol why am i not suprised
its ravens gameday and were still talking about the browns smh

someone needs to tell advertisers its honestly ok to have a football commercial without baker in it
texans we need a stop to get deshaun the ball back

ingram

haha big truzz go weeeeeeee
someone gets ejected and no one considers showing a replay
please change the game clock to 4 seconds because a player thrashed around like a 5 year old
we need some typa marlon play rn a pick or a forced fumble something man d needs to wake up
i havent seen the ravens make an interception like that since ed reed
again earl who
wait you can have a first possession without a td
thank god we have so many doctors in this thread
tavon young is the michael campanaro of cornerbacks
lamar looks mad hes gonna scorch these guys
what the fuck is this western cat commercial lmao
matt almost judon
this team was going to play us hard from the start were in their house and we embarrassed them in ours last year i still feel good about our chances but we cant give up big plays like the cooks catch
i swear judon busts through the line like a madman once every ten plays and then just totally whiffs
what the hell the refs literally giving the texans time
you guys are ridiculous that was a bs penalty on averrett the refs gifted them that drive
what happened to will fuller

marlon fuckin humphrey is what happened
gotta admit last year spoiled us up 13 on the road against a playoff team and were griping

still feels like this team should be playing better
big bois

little bois
line is low key horrible today if we had flacco he would have been sacked four times that drive and it wouldnt have even been his fault
bal 20
hou 7
refs 3
queen just jumping ontop the dog pile lol
this is a road game ugly win is a good win
it feels weird being up 17 and still not feeling totally satisfied this team is so good
i feel like we just sleepwalked into 30 points
woke up at 3am for this game totally worth it
off topic but good god

andy slaterandyslater news to report patriots rb james whites father was in a car crash today and did not survive his mother wasalso in the car and is in critical condition whites father tyrone was a captain with the miamidade police department james was told and is inactive tonight
i know im spoiled when they score over 30 and i still feel the performance was middling
have a great day from down under ravens flock

enjoy the win and sleep well

big fucking truss boys
im really happy about that td but i this tavon young injury really killed the mood for me
what a freakin int dude can you guys believe the rams traded that man to us how fucking stupid
the lj stands for lamar jackson fort
judon needs to step up if he wants to get paid
kung fu ingram is my favorite ingram
no one deserves it more than ingram an unselfish player who has been the heart of this team
ok deshon elliot has arrived
anybody want to clue me in on what he did

looking at u announcers
discussion about last years playoff game

and i was having such a great time
yanda youre gonna have to start eating again my dawg
why arent they replacing averett with jimmy smith
im the joker baybeeee
ravens all right were done

jk lol
refs must be on draftkings
that shot of watson on the sideline
sam koch has the easiest job in the nfl
the texans fucked up doing that their defense was playing well and now they just gave us momentum and good field position
how the fuck do the refs add 3 seconds on the clock with no flag and no time out what the fuck
administrative failure lololol
will someone please block for fucking lamar
justin reid just caused us a missed highlight forever
we scored 33 and you can tell lamar is gonna be hard on himself
prayers that tavon doesnt have a serious injury
lamar bout to go off after not liking the ending to that drive
the o line looks like shit

signed ravens fan since 96
i love tucker but i hate field goals
where the hell is jk dobbins
calais campbell is built like all of my rpg characters
the texans are a lucky bunch being forced to play the chiefs and ravens backtoback
what happened to their main target hes getting locked up by some all pros on defense
queen just jumping on top of the pile lol
lmaoo that split second when peters was confused what to do with the int
run and pass blocking have been shit both games so far very concerning
we missing yanda big time
do we have any more 5th round picks to trade for a nickle corner
missing tavon already
anyone see queen just yeet his way on top of the pile
i get that we all want the game in hand but overall its been a well played game against a playoff team

were not just gonna dick down every team we play
when he started kicking the texans logo
its hilarious how a couple of years ago i wouldve been stoked on scoring 33 pts but today i feel like our offense was a little off haha
3316 blowout and the ravens couldve played even better
im glad kc won because i dont see mahomes losing twice
still fucking got it
quick someone feed yanda before we get the ball back
touchdown on this drive ends the game
offensive line you son of a bitch im in
you friccin morons you just got grammed
hey i dont know about you guys but im rooting for the ravens
gif request mark ingram punching then round housing the texans logo in the back of the end zone
are we all watching this cat commercial i can never unsee that
that pass to brown was the first one ive seen jackson actually miss all year
oh my god that is one of the best interceptions ive ever seen
daily reminder we turned a kicker and kenny young into marcus peters
i didnt see anything on averett weak call imo
that was such a stupid penalty on averret doesnt even make sense stills ran into him
ravens not up by 30 at the half we must be gunning for that 1 pick next year
houston isnt as bad as the week 1 game would make you believe
chiefs are loosing to the chargers

lets gooo
harbs saw hollywood spamming the wildcat on madden
big trusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
and they said ingram is washed
no little boy
alright boys lets not get cute with it lets run it down their goddamn throats
throbbin for dobbins
that looked very 27ish
the line actually looks horribe rn thank god for lamar tho
positives controlling the top

negatives the oline needs to do better lamar shouldnt have to scramble this much
7 pass attempts 5 rush attempts for lamar 1 rushing attempt by the runningbacks combined
its not fun ending a drive with tucker but its damned good knowing hes there
can we talk about the fucking swagger of don wink mullet big belly sleeveless shirts hes basically a cooler version of everybodys dad
dumb dumb call by texans to go for it on 4th
funny a tiktok ad on the day that tiktok is being pulled in the us
still want to say judon is just not worth the price we need real pass rush
bruh hollywood looking like an alien with that big ass helmet thats our guy
tuckers gotta be in on a fake fg someday koch to tucker for a td cmon harbaugh
man lamar had green infront of him
take your credit dude who called the marlon punch
it doesnt matter which lj it is they all score tds
how is marlon humphrey just so good when it comes to ripping the football out of the opponents hands its a form of artwork at this point
lets get a mp pick or elliott pick here
thank you vedvik for marcus peters
this sub

texans score we are trash we blow we need this we need that

defense steps up omg we are thr best i love this defense we are the best ever since the 2000 defense omg omg omg

ive missed you all
weak penalty
yoooo this is sus from the refs lol
administrative failure my ass
so wait they just give you extra time if you complain

what is this brady era new england
that shit on averett is illegal contact but that isnt a penalty defending andrews
woof wide open 30 yards downfield lucky watson missed
get averett out of the fucking game
biden what is your plan if young is out for significant time
dont know if its the doordash sushi or not but i have a funny feeling in my gut
the roundhouse kick is epic
thats a big boy run
hahahaha fuck you earl
its ok watson well all be your fans next week
mom can we get ed reed 20

mom we have ed reed 20 at home

ed reed at home reid 21 houston texans
since im watching from holland im going to bed happy very very happy no big injuries hope young is okay another w all good here
i see you chuckc36 way to lead them king proud of my guys tonyjefferson
excuse me im the most happy that were in the lamar era but can we cool it with the joe flacco slander in this thread

some of us were actually fans before 2019 lol
lmaoooo our fan base is so spoiled
its crazy how lamar was absolutely surrounded by defenders yet looked completely calm
wanted 7 but ill take the 3
we are doing alright but whats with the lack of rb runs
oline looking like hot garbage so far
pat ricard has twice as many career touchdown catches as nick boyle poor poor nick boyle ryanmink
the inability to get consistent pressure on the qb is really becoming a liability
man we need to start making some of those sacks great catch by fells on fairly good coverage by levine
lamar had plenty of space in front of him
fruit punch
fruit punch
thats a td baby lets go
pay marlon yesterday lol what a play from our all pro cb
that was one of the nastiest ints ive ever seen
marcus marcus peters peters
every play is a fucking highlight reel what a pick by peters rams fans are sooooo dumb for saying he wasnt good
that was one of the best interceptions ive ever seen
oline is a big concern and stanley is hurt again shit
losing yanda is already looking huge for us
bullshit penalty then stopping the clock and adding time what the fuck is this officiating
that gets called pi 99 of the time
bro wtf is ray doing in that picture
avarett is straight up trash and they know it
after two weeks im not mad we didnt drop bank on judon
yall act like nobody is ever going to get a completion against us
hey fuck pittsburgh amirite
td along with a roundhouse that would make chuck norris proud
i am so fucking gay for mark ingram iii idgaf what anyone says
you just lost to mark ingram at qb
also what a block by mekari

big brain move from harbaugh

if you lose the challenge you lose the timeout you probably wouldve used anyway to regroup before basically a gamedeciding call
the time the ref will be under the hood will almost certainly be more time than a normal timeout
you can luck out and pick up the first
did yall see what happened i didnt see a replay
i definitely feel like lamar was grumpy today
kinda wish wed let lamar get a td there somehow
dobbins said fuck yo defence
i like the call to hollywood but maybe they could have disguised it better regardless nice tackle by the texans defender
lamar got us 3 points there evaded like 4 sacks
ok guys time to put rgiii in
foh with these tik tok commercials
lamar said
lamar looked bored af on the bench
lamar in a commercial
fun fact lamar is 910 right now
theyre just targeting anthony levine since the tavon young injury
deshon elliot is a work in progress right now
okay now get some defense i want a turnover
good lord tuckers kick couldnt have been more on center
thats a touchdown
who called for the marlo play lol
im sorry 15 straight games with a takeaway is this even legal
peters is an absolute fucking chad
deshaun looked like he wanted to break that surface lol
this fucking interior o line is hot garbage
refs gifting the texans 3 points is pathetic
nice drive refs
what fucking garbage refs spotting the texans up the field there and even giving them time to get a fg
i think we downplayed the loss of yanda
the oline is booboo tiddy fuck today
pitkc going to feast on our oline if we dont get it worked out
brown is straight up getting over powered at the los he gets knocked back 23 yards instantly
yall acting like obj is not playing against jj fucking watt
averett looking like chykie brown
lj jumped on the pile

8 minute drive needed here
whats it like to root for a good team

sad nyj fan
yes the truss is still enormous
at first i thought it was lamar that took it then i was like why is he not running way faster lmao
big trusssssssss
thats my runningback
mi2 going fucking mauy thai on the logo is the funniest shit i have seen today lmao
earl who
i love this team
i just want a lamar bomb to the endzone and im good
cbs show some god damn replays what the fuck
grumpy lamar gonna stunt next week
tuck is definately happy today
shoutout to jimmy smith for not hearing his name at all today
i dont deserve this what did i do in my life to deserve being this happy every sunday
jk has such a bright future
i like dobbins i just think hes neat
dobbins is fucking legit
that dobbins run is gonna make it look like we curbstomped the texans with the run game today when thats not exactly the story lol
its funny to see players on the other team surrounding lamar after the game they are such big fans of him
man fuck all these injuries today wtf
slay kweeeeeen slayyyyyyyy
tough time for his first bad throw i think he had the td
the sound of the ball being kicked in an empty stadium is so satisfying
lamar has to take the space and get the easy first down i know going for tds is nice but on 3rd you gotta secure the first
3 man rush lamar should have scrambled that time
marlon the most underrated defensive player in the game no one even acknowledges it
it looks like lj got in
marlo and punching the ball out name a more iconic duo
marlons new sponsorship deal
not the lj who i thought would score today but ill take it
fort isnt a hofer and he may not be on the ravens all that long but fuck if hes not a great story and an awesome pickup love that guy
lj lj sb lv
somewhere ed reed is smiling
yeah marlo and marcus are going allpro again
i love mp juiceman
marshall yanda if youre listening if jesus can come back from the dead you can come back to play in the nfl marshall pls
refs are babying texans
holy fuck theyre really trying to get houston back in this game
move marlo into the slot jimmy peters to the outside 3 best corners on the field like last year dont want to see averett out there
late to the party but wtf was that illegal contact call why didnt the refs just give them 3pts
i dont like how much lamar is getting hit in the pocket so far this season protect the franchise
honestly thank god for the lj fort tdotherwise this would be an uncomfortable 1310 lead

we get the ball at the start of the half keep up the faith flock
harbaugh mask tastes good
thank god for tucker where would we be without him
averett stinks but that was a hell of a throw by deshaun
get averetts trash ass off the field fuck
trade or sign another cb averrett cannot play
bench averett play jimmy
offense needs to turn it up a bit defense is going to be a little gassed long drive
jesus christ i had no idea fairbairn was this good
i was wondering why lamar looked so slow until i saw the 21 on the jersey

ingram hell yeah coach lets go for it
we all feeling a little anxious with the game acting like 30pts aint our base line
stanley isnt known as a run blocker but holy crap was that great
where are all the greg roman is trying to be too cute comments
big truss no little truss
why is ingram always physically abusive to opposing teams logos lmao
big rb no lil rb
team looks inconsistent asf and we still drop 38 30 scary
mahomes is 1328

wat
i sprinkled the old bay on my natty right before that drive good luck charm i think so
tavon youngs injury is gonna be a hit to the secondary
love that harbs trusts lamar
im a little disappointed with how little weve run ingram tbh
show the replay of the dq

why is the broadcast so bad about showing replays today
whens the last time tucker kicked 4 fgs
really puts into perspective how fucking incredible our team is that i somehow feel disappointed with todays game
dobbins only if you could broke that off for a td
dobby is free
pick your poison of which rb you want to fuck you up
wannabe lamar runs to get wannabe tucker in position for chipshot field goal
wonder how some of you fairweathers wouldve handled the flacco regime lmao
why do i even come to this thread when were not winning by 40
the ravens didnt finish with 200 yards rushing


jk you fricken moron
important to remember we are probably the best offense in the league every team is going to bring their best effort each week lamar making good decisions today o line needs to give him more time
dont forget to switch to incognito browser guys we about to watch a whole team get fucked by a beautiful black man
useless broncos
i still dont understand how ricard missed that block on 2nd down
that jet sweep with hollywood went so bad lol
fuck these indoor stadiums with concrete floors
were only 13 minutes real clock not game clock into the game and my anxiety is already sky high
this play calling is weird as fuck
what is going on right now is the offense not in sync this game
ok all these designed lamar runs why
its points ill take it
remember last year guys it was 00 against the texans late into the 2nd quarter we then won 417
i miss yanda
ill take that instead of watson getting sacked and then starting our drive in our own half
earl who
thicc ricc
heh my wife just called the last 2 plays i married a winner
no crowd noise being pumped in pretty sure i hear crowd noise
gonna be a close game but we got this
i swear hollywood looks like a kid playing with adults
were playing okay just a few miscues here and there no worries
thats a fucking touchdown
marlon humphrey is literally one punch man hahaha
thats a fucking touchdown
dude lj fort i dont know how hes so good but he is
thanks for cutting lj pittsburgh

edit trading
robbed the rams
thats mr mpjuiceman sir
i love ravens football
peters is an insane ball hawk
the o line is worrisome
these fucking refs hahaha
cobb was being a fucking bitch
they just fucking gifted the texans a field goal to keep them in the game what fucking bullshit
trash refereeing
on some drives we look elite other drives we look lost lol
bills beat the dolphins by 3 and now allen is leading the mvp race bills fans are so special
rbs need to be involved in the offense second half texans gonna keep getting to lamar if the playcalling revolves around lamar dropping back on 90 of snaps way too predictable
i know we are up two scores but it doesnt feel like offense is off sync and defense is struggling to stop watson not to mention the refs helped with two bs calls at the end
what the fuck is an illegal double team block
hello oline can you please show up
peters almost stripped the ball
fire averett into the goddamn sun
not having tavon in there is a liability hope hes alright
harbaugh looks pissed
week 2 ppl calm down
trade 93 he sucks so bad s
somehow held them to a fg you want to see frustrating block the kick

roundhouse kick the logo
roundhouse
what a fucking play
when in doubt truzzzzzzz
no little boi
hell yeah coach lets go for it
wildcat on 4th and 1 td
we want the chiefs

we want the chiefs
that brian billick offensive genius finally coming to fruition i knew he had it in him
mark ingram becoming chuck norris
calais campbell probably reminds offensive players of when they first saw california redwood trees shallnotpass
fairbairn aint half bad
horrible spot wtf
andrews held that block and that was a td
sad news to report patriots rb james whites father was in a car crash today and did not survive his mother was also in the car and is in critical condition

whites father tyrone was a captain with the miamidade police department

james was told and is inactive tonight andyslater
fuck the titans
i wanted mandrews td but i guess
bruh dobbins is fucking unreal
fucking chargers choked
we have so many weapons its hard to involve them all miles boykins looks really good so far
just because we havent scored 2 tds yet doesnt mean the sky is falling this will be a close game
if we blow out the texans itll be because theyre bad yet if the steelers go 20 its all about how theyre back just like the browns when beating up the bengals
this poor guy is so injury prone
tavon and injuries is an iconic duo i do not enjoy
i remember when we had mark ingram those were the days
roman trying too hard
patrick queen is everywhere wow the dude is so fast
jihad ward has 2020 foresight
i love yall but these comments have me seriously questioning yalls knowledge of the game
imagine not converting on 4th and 1 in your own territory and the opposing team scores a touchdown
i feel like boyle has been stopped inside the 5 like 45 times now in his career
ofc the best heisman house commercial is the one with lamar in it
lmfao these dudes cant get set and a play off in time with no crowd noise texans are bums lol
gotta start sacking this dude
justin hands tucker
hey guys fgs give us points too some of the people in here are wayy too spoiled
someone here just called for a marlon type of play good job honey
one punch man marlo
marlon is so good at punching the ball out
humphrey was destined to be a raven
marlon humphrey is like the one punch man of the nfl
man lj has been a beast for us
thats a fucking td
baller ass play so lucky to scoop fort
lj fort is a damn good player he was only a journeyman because the rest of the league didnt know how to use him
get marlon the brinks truck
man if we had a pass rush wed be nastyyyyy
i audibly yelled holy shit
even peters looked surprised that he got that as he got up lol
petition to change marcus peters nick name to mp grape juice man
haha why is mp wearing a winter hat in texas in september love that guy
so the wide receiver can just barrel into the corner and get an illegal contact
fuck off refs
every time i hear number 23 i forget who the fuck it is

then remember why i dont remember every time

averett is just erased from my mind
these refs are actually so trash
why is averett on the field when jimmy smith exists and brandon carr is a fa
what the fuck is that
these refs are actually missing chromosomes
what a gift of 3 points man
that was some bullshit bullshit calls meant to give the texans come points smfh i hope we come back out and destroy them
grade a bullshit ref texans should thank them for the 3 points
everything about that drive was horseshit officiating

lol torrey vs pollard
jk with the ray rice type crawl
offensive line is getting exploited today not good moving forward
damn our oline blows today
phillips is gonna lose starting position i bet dude is not great
that kick was reminiscent of the game winner in the playoffs against denver same distance and looked the same

also how the fuck was that not pi on andrews
oline looking shaky but well bounce back
o line looks atrocious today
we have arguably the best offensive tackle duo in the league but the interior oline is looking like a big liability that just cant stay the case moving forward
too many fgs today roman has to get away from drop back pass plays down field and run some quick slants draws or something to slow the rush because our o line cant
should be 27 7 smh
clay matthews is at home watching our abysmal pass rush
russ wilson looking like lando calrizzian
my names anthony averett and i use cable
get averrett off the field
averet giving chykie brown flashbacks
shocker averett getting bitched as usual
it feels like were playing so bad but were still up 13 with 1 quarter left i am becoming very conscious of how spoiled we are
if they get this its still a 10 point game just need to pound the rock
i love the home crowd boos when theres no home crowd
a long scoring drive would do a lot for us right now boys and the great llama still need to tack atleast 2 tds to his stat sheet
bill polian finally got his wish lamar lined up at wr
big nutz harbz
big boy no little boy
tucker got a lot of fantasy points this game too
toooooouchdownnnnn raaaaaavennnssss

and a beating on the texans logo

truss
this is why we will always be that team to go for 4th down
chiefs are looking very soft and very beatable today love to see it
how did fort miss that sack
its crazy that this is an off day for the team
if kc loses to herberts first start
i think thats a good challenge lamar might have gotten it
aaaaaand unclench
was against the decision but i cant be mad with the outcome
im calling it defense with a garbage time int
this game was just so we could get jt some reps
dobbins is gonna be a superstar
yo dobbins is wild for real
jk but he aint joking
love watching dobbins speed to get to the edge tough enough to bang through the center and good contact balance to break tackles the future is bright
man itll feel like an eternity until next monday
so they just forgot about tucker butker best in the league
im going to run that play on my wife tonight
i much prefer when the ravens reach the end zone instead of the texans perhaps the ravens should do that more
the ravens are playing very well for my birthday today just a few observations

im liking a lot of jacksons decisionmaking a couple high throws esp the throw on the dig route that was caught by the jumping wr but overall hes been good

averett is not a starting db hes committed a couple dumb penalties and left his assignment open a couple times

i like the dl pressure on watson still stunned he got away from a sack

a solid 710 performance

the illegal contact calls were pretty tickytacky calls i saw a little bit of contact on the one replay that they showed on the first call but i wouldve not called either
how are we beating kc next week as if they arent struggling against the chargers right now

theyre obviously the team to beat and will be tough to beat but some of you need to chill
how is this trash o line going to stand up to kc next week
wtf is this play calling rn
wish we would run it more
decent drive sucks we didnt come out with 6 but miles better than our first drive
patrick queen is everywhere and i fucking love it
wish that att girl was my friend and nothing else
how did he get up so fast lmao
way to make up for last weeks fumble ricky
lamars about to bring me back from 40 points down in fantasy
got up like a man possessed
lol my boy ricard aint letting that ball go for anything
that cat commercial was terribly awesome
we need to trade for a real pass rusher tbh

an edge
the only time we get anything remotely close to a good pass rush is when we scheme up a blitz that gets a us a free runner to the qb we dont have anyone that can beat their blocker
annoying hope the defense can clean up a bit like last week too watsons obviously better than mayfield though
watson is good guys we are not playing against baker
bless u tucker
we fine yall even when the offense looks out of sync were gaining yards and getting first downs
fruit punch is back
he totally scored there
marlo has mastered the peanut punch
fuck kiko alonso
we ask for turnover we receive we ask for td we receive i love the llama era
lj fortmost underrated ravens fa signing ever
defense is nasty i just wish we had more of a passrush
lj fort is the ravens defensive mvp so far this year who wouldve thought
quick reminder that lj fort wasnt even on a team this time last year decosta has a knack for finding talent where no one else does
chiefs are losing i just wanna see that team become human
lj fort consistently proves to me why he deserves to be my new favorite linebacker
i like that from harrison
mp juiceman he got that ju ice in him
fruit punch straight to the juice man 2020 no fly zone baby
bro this defense is nasty
holy fuck that was beeeeeautiful
i would pay to have a live stream of marcus peters micd up
its just the browns right
what a catch
jesus h christ i love this goddamn football team
that pick might have been the best catch so far this game
man that int was incredible all hands full extension against the grain while going to the ground
give me mp juiceman over ramsey every day of the week and twice on sundays
okay justice hill in a commercial lol random
what an interception holy hell mp juiceman
get ronnie out
how long would it take marshal to put on 100 lbs
this game is a good example of badly we miss yanda not only his blocking ability but his line calls as well
good guy marcus peters lmaoo
pussy ass call
our pass rush sucks but to make it worse they cant tackle whatsoever we miss 90 of our chances at sacks which are already rare
sorry but these are just some bad calls not too upset with our d this drive
wtf just happened
what the hell is happening
these fucking refs wow
how much bob paying these reff to keep his job
thats such bullshit
what the fuckkkk these refs
still up by 10 and we get the ball to start the 2nd half
the ravens are going to have to dial up some quick hitters the texans are sitting deep like they did against the chiefs

lamar gotta look for his checkdown 3 sacks at the half against this defense is keeping the game from being a blowout
is it part of the defense exhausted fresh dobbins in gameplan or why on earth isnt jk getting any carries
man im so happy to have ray rice back
how was that not dpi mckinney never gets his head around
wheres our illegal contact call
its like were fucking shocked they blitz everyone on 3rd downs theyve been doing it all day
can greg roman realize theyre blitzing those situations and get some designed out of pocket throws
maybe we can finally get some pressure
averett did something

edit nvm
averette giveth averette taketh
why the fuck do we have avrett covering cooks
someone has to gif queen jumping on the pile
queen looking extra and i like it
me how are we going to beat the chiefs with this oline and without tavon

also me looks down and sees that chargers are up on kc 176
jj watt again is good at this football thing
ingram really just spin kicked that wall lmao
i cant believe that worked lmfaooooo
lol thought that was lamar
no little boy
nasty
this game has felt like just a fucking grinding slogfest cant believe we are up by as much as we are that fumble return was huge
did ingram just karate kick the texans logo merciless
omg that play design was so fucking good too roman showing off
what blocking on that play i will want to know what lamar did out there tbh
the force is with us
that td took watson soul you could see it as soon as he seen the td
lamar and hollywood on the bench there is so fun to see
why did they kick
time to run that clock out
now that i feel comfortable that we will win i will give props to justin reid he has been very strong for the texans in these first two games
he definitely got it
the gus bus is in full service
what did blacklock do
hey guys pro tip stop going out of bounds
no idea why gus and ingram didnt just fall down in bounds
cant wait for ravens wired this week just to hear ingram after the 4th down td
dobbins isnt human
that was a stumble away from a touchdown

dobbins future is so bright man i am pumped
i cant tell if the texans totally dont give a shit anymore or that was a truly phenomenal run
jk aint kidding
guys guys guys we are so lucky what a team we have
good win tavon young injury sucks but given what a bloodbath this sunday was i think we got off light
about tavon young

by video worry for acl injury his day is done and maybe season too many of those today 1 is too many profootballdoc
sometimes i wish lamar would run
i am scared for next week
we miss yanda
everyone is downplaying how good watson is dude is a great qb he is gonna make some good plays against any defense
go ravens fuck pittsburgh
back up qb gives steelers trouble

steelers fans ben is back

how are people picking this team to win our division
nfl contractual obligations lets go ravens
tavon exhibiting his allglass body again
the fact he was able to walk is a good sign
whos elizabeth patrick is the only queen i know
this sub was moaning 90 seconds ago were spoiled
lamar is doing everything the team need to wake up
lamar almost made that work insane
something seems off
i kinda forgot what a fourth down felt like
solid drive
gotta use these rbs more

lamar can do it himself but he doesnt have to
still fucking got it
henry cavills like 40 and mbb is like 16 who tf did the casting for this movie the age gap is absurd for siblings
so thats how that feels
well its a good thing watson didnt get sacked now
thats my quuuueeeeennnnn
patrick queen roty no doubtttt
houston decided the cleveland fake punt worked so well last week they thought theyd try their own dumb play in their own zone
lmaoooooo
now run the ball please
poor nick he almost gets there every time then somebody else scores the td
good to see ricard getting involved
i was watching ravens higlights from 2018 and nick boyle was one of the like 3 main players who are still on the roster
ricard making it up for last week
james harrison fan duel commercial greatest thing ive seen all day
there is no fullback in the game that didnt start off in baltimore that would have made that catch
imagine getting scored on by a defensive tackle
damn guys this the season with the worst injury bug to the league half the niners are injured and saquan barkley had to be carried out the game with a knee injury damn i really like barkley and his season might be over in week fucking 2
any updates on tavon
pass rush is fucking ass wtf
pass rush needs an upgrade asap
texans run a pretty similar offense to ours
thats ok will get it back
everybody calm down our shoutouts are fun but these dog fights make the game so much more exciting
texans are playing a lot more physical imo
they always try to jinx tucker smh
lets have a stop here
yall chill out were winning its early relax
humphreys right hook is legendary
challenge thats a td
fruit pawnch
it kinda looked like he scored there
my fantasy team would really love this to be a td thanks tony
i do not see how fort was down
theyre going to rule that a td
i dont see where he went out of bounds
lmao give lj fort some offensive carries
fort looked scary af running that ball
to think the steelers didnt want fort and his massive fucking biceps
wow fort looked amazing that scoop the carry the eye for blocking the dive at the end

he must have played lots of offense in high school or something looked natural out there

also that was a td
i love overreacting at the slightest hindrance but also screaming my throat out at play like this being a ravens fan is so fun
see yall relax
little known fact lj stands for lyndon johnson
dont get me wrong im always happy whenever we get a td but you just love to see a guy happy on the sideline happy for you fort
fruit punch
take in we found out about lj fort at our joint practice with the eagles last year he impressed and we stole him from their practice squad now hes absolutely balling
justin tucker with another kick hes getting tired

i love kevin harlan
thank god we finally woke up
my god what have we done
good shit peters lets fuck em up
god i fucking love our secondary
i almost yelled reeeeeeeeedddddd
holy shit

these defense is scary
im ready for rg3
lmfao imagine taking jalen ramsey over marcus peters
this is the greatest day ive had since last sunday
fruit punch and juiceman
we are going to be getting some bandwagon fans this year arent we i havent seen a ravens team this good in fucking years
damn obj is getting manhandled
we need to get yanda beefy again and get him suited up
wtf is happening with this line at least stanley is walking it off but fuck man yandas absence is hurting us
please be okay stanley
what is our oline doing 2nd last year today we look like 2nd to last come on now
what a bullshit call on averett
someone fire up the bull shit chant
how the fuck do they miss that hold on judon jesus christ
averet is horrible man
that was a bs call averett getting targeted
those are some shitty penalties how the heck can a receiver just bowl somebody over and get the flag
why did the fucking clock stop what
but they didnt have a to and didnt spike it
ill take a 2010 lead on the road while getting the ball to start the 2nd half but definitely had a couple missed opportunities

shoulda scored off the peters pick oline needs to play way better but overall a great first half
nontraditonal quarterback play how traditional we talking because im sure lamar is more throwback than most
the texans have turned the ball over 3x yet are only down 10 they held the ravens to 2 field goals and sacked them out of fg range for a third

this may sound weird but the texans defense is actually doing a decent job while sticking to their game plan stop the run all costs get the ravens to 3rd and long hunt

good thing our defense has been opportunistic our offense hasnt turned the ball over

w all of that being said the ravens could win this game going away if they get their ground game going tire out the texans defensive front this game is done
fuck yeah lets run with gus more

next play hit behind line of scrimmage
he didnt play that ball am i crazy
was that not pi the defender wasnt looking for the ball
how was that not pi
orlando brown hardly even trying right now
so thankful we have tucker
how was there no pi on that throw to marky mark bruh
i like running that clock down lets keep doing that
damn man 4 sacks wowwww
you know i understand we are winning and everything

but these refs need to call penalties correctly if that was the texans that would be pi on us give us a break
chances we see fluker next game
we are good but i feel like this team needs a wake up call
wilson looking like pablo escobar lol
get avrett some help
averett is so fucking bad
ill say it again averrett needs to be off the field
stop letting them hang around
wow 4th q already our first drive was amazing time killer now got to get them off the field on 3rd and long
hold em to 3 here and put em away next possession
averet out there giving me sharese wright flashbacks
queen jumping on that pile was a real ravens move love this kid
hopefully we follow up with a nice long drive for a score to ice it
lmao who yelled oh my god
seeing baby yoda made me feel a little less anxious
i dont think watt played in our game last year he has been the difference today
mark motherfucking ingram
big boi no lil boi
tears thats my running back
hahaha that kick in the ez haha
big balls harbaugh
big truss ingram
woo woo
six points
lol hollywood trying to bully through two guys for 3 yards and a 1st down was kinda funny especially when mark breaks a 30 yard td right after it on 4th down
only way i would have loved that more were if it were a direct snap to ricard who then threw a td pass to lamar because why the fuck not lamar needs to add not bad for a wide receiver to his resume
bigggg boiiii
i fucking love that creativity in the play calling
you say big truss you get a big upvote
i thought that was lamar lol
we scored 30 on an off day against a competent opponent we aight
feel bad for watson get my guy a real franchise
elliot is loads better than earl at blitzing
alright 99yd td to hollywood go
score again
i dont mean to alarm yall but the chiefs just tied with the chargers
good challenge low risk high reward even if he doesnt get it its just a qb sneak
why did 90 get ejected
any have a gif of what got that texan ejected
lamar humphrey peters ingram tuck queen andrews hollywood all killin it

but yo it feels so good when our support guys are making monster plays fort obviously but gus bus making big moves snead has been a monster anytime the balls been near him boykin making some huge blocks d line getting tons of pressure i love this team
pass rush has been better in the 2nd half
daaaamn jk
rides him down like a rodeo cowboy oo
seriously not fucking fair to have ingram gus and jkand justice hill
next weeks game is going to make me drink heavily
well a rookie threw for over 300 on this d hopefully lamar can do the same
no pass rush is going to be the death of this team
you guys are honestly the worst sometimes holy shit
t young is made of phone chargers
not again tavon
good thing we have cb depth
god damn feels so bad for tavon hopefully hes good
theres going to be sooooo many commercials
and the sunday of a million injuries strikes baltimore

queens got a motor on him good
queen was a great pick up never gives up on the play
run the fucking ball
offensive line does not look good so far
even with the oline woes and tavon injury we can all take some chicken soup for the soul and watch tucker work his craft
where can i get that face cover that harbaugh is wearing looks like the md flag but with ravens colors
tucker still fucking has it
offensive line needs help
53 wont hear the end of that
dont forget yall this is exactly how the game started last year we won no contest 5 times over chill
ward is too big for that shit
hey only we can do that
lmao dumbass bill obrian
great pressure those past 2 plays now turn this into a td
wallstreetbets
if theyre going for it on 4th and 1 on their own 30 you know theyre scared
just remember last year when we played the texans we started slow
yas queen
off topic but how the fuck did the cowboys win their game
what an amazing catch by project pat
i feel so much better now lmao
okay be honest who had picard picked for a td
celebrate good times come on
lol imagine giving up a receiving td to a defensive lineman
what a catch by ricard wow
and yall were worried in the first half trust in lamar
kc is getting beat by the chargers
gonna need to answer those short te passes over the middle
our pass rushers especially unblocked blitzers need to play with discipline in the backfield and stop blowing past deshaun every time
im out of beer

this is a tragedy
ordered some doordash sushi if i die i die
where is jk
still fuckin got it
glad were getting points but wish we could be turning those into tds
god i love humphrey thats a td
the marlo punch is baaaack
that was a td wtf
marlooooo
you know what im talking about to juju
marlo with the punch
thats a td
marlon fuck yea baby
fruit punch baby
that bounce off the fumble was perfect for fort

if this gets upheld the ravens better make it count
marlons punch is legendary
even if its not a score i think we can punch it in from the 1 hopefully with jk cause i flexed him in fantasy lol
give that man his touchdown
theyre reviewing the turnover can they change it to a td if they see it
thats a touchdown
pay llama pay humphrey pay stanley
our secondary is scaryyyyyy marlo with a big forced fumble
the way marlon punches the ball out so well reminds me of peanut tillman

fbi officer tillman is currently a 2020 hof nominee

all hail king marlon
lj fort was such a good pick up
i was surprised the broadcasters werent calling out that it was an obvious td
linebacker unit is looking very solid
i like when kevin harlan does our game
defense woke up just how i like it dirty
marcus peters legendary
peters grew three feet on that dive
juicemaaaaaannnnn
my god this defense yall
juice juice juice
defensive play of the year right there
holy shit i think peters just pulled a micheal jordan and grew six feet for that pick
dear lord what a catch
but muh defense

you people are so impatient
has juiceman always been his name
what a pick dudes a bonafide stud
hope tavon is ok
we are almost too good of a team everyone is going to start hating on us
the talent on this team is absolutely disgusting
id like to apologize for my doubts when the game began
i literally yelled ohhhhhh when peters got that int
o line might be the only negative this half so far
can watt

like

not
love how the fg target line cbs makes for tucker is at like the 45 lmao
stanley down noooooooo
dobbins cant block
buying offensive line 10k west varrock bank
offensive line has room for improvement
this is like worst o line performance ive seen since like 2017 they got 3 sacks on lamar not even fucking aaron donald got a touch on lamar last year
shitty playcall considering how bad the line has been
averett has not had a single positive play his time here
how many times can judon fly into the backfield and whiff man
thanks refs
wtf why did they give them extra time
refs are the best players on the texans
houston clawing and scratching to just stay within 10
suck a nut refs
before that last drive i was just thinking how the refs have been pretty decent thus far this season after that drive what the damn hell refs you piece of shit
officials kinda lost the handle over that last minute
offensive is a bit shaky defense are killing it
offensive play calling is absolutely embarrassing when did we bring marty back
i know you guys think we need to win this game by 50 but i just want to avoid the injury gods at play today i will consider that a win
pollard acting like a clown on twitter again to no ones surprise
were playing okay considering everything o line needs to step the fuck up no more sacks
should we rotate fluker in at rg
im just gonna say we still adjusting to lack of pre season fans i mean these 10pts dont feel great to up by but its not like we down 8pts to a rookie qb right now
we scored 20 points on a playoff team in their stadium were doing more than fine
the ravens put in a run

this sub i pretend i do not see it and continue to complain about throws
just had flashbacks of ray rice dobbins is money
ahh you got me short of the first jk
long ass drive
shouldnt the defender have turned for the ball
awful oline man smh
that was a close one there tuck
still fuckin got it
i wish this game was more like our last matchup
this oline needs to get their shit together quick
didnt realize we were playing sfs allworld dline today embarrassing
this ol play is pathetic
this o line smdh

what was that sack number 4

need to get that shit straight
oline was shit week 1 alsothey had terrible grades
queen is fast as hell
dont even bring 23 home with us god awful
of course it was on averett how the fuck is this guy still on the team
plz get averett outta here
averrett getting absolutely demolished here
patrick leaping on the pile lmao
look i get being homers but the fact that a lot of people cant respect what watson does is kinda sad hes playing a great game so far they better not win or ill probably join the blind homerist discussion but at least give respect where respect is due
averett has singlehandedly put bend dont break back on the menu
need to put the nail in the coffin on this drive td and games over
not sure why youd go for 3 here
alright same drive as the last one and lets go home and get ready for kc
deshaun looks sad lol
i just creamed my pants
what a fucking play call
watching in my hotel room on stupid gamecast and holy tits im hyped
i love that we went for it on 4th there great call and great execution
ok low key was like wtf is this wildcatill sit down
22 on 4th down conversions
i cant wait for ingrams post game at the mic
watsons having a decent game today will give him that
do we have any update on tavon havent heard anything from announcers
tha j o k e r
i truly do not understand how some analysts had deshaun watson rated above lamar going into this season
good challenge
good challenge here dont get it we can go for it on 4th and we burn a time out which we may not need get it and its a 1st
challange it man he stretched out it should be good
go for it all aboard the gus bus
bleed the clock
all aboard the gus bus
gus edwards is the rg3 of the rbs lol show up to close it out
gus is a starting rb
gus bus lets go
theeeeeee wheels on the bus go move bitch
why did this guy get dqd
stop running out of bounds
thats like 80 seconds that should be off the clock roman fucked up
the two sweeps were really crap calls regardless points are points gg houston
why did that player get ejected i didnt catch it
the shots of the texans sideline makes them all look depressed
dobby
dobbins
jk just ripping off 40 yard run like its nothing
man i wish hed of scored on that would of made flexing him worth it
rides him down like a rodeo cowboy wat
i almost feel bad for the texans after getting pounded by ingram and edwards dobbins comes in and absolutely gashes them
yabba dabba dooooooooooooooo
can we talk about half time adjustments both weeks so far especially the oline this week rbs have had great vision but oline just blasting holes
20 bring on the chiefs
no lie the la stadium looks amazeballs
ok that dude kicked three 58 yd field goals two in a row after an ice timeout
sometime my inner masochist wants tucker to kick my balls his amazing leg caressing my scrotum would truly be sensational
people are acting like the texans are a bad team they were literally up by like 21 or something against the superbowl champions in the playoffs last year this game isnt going to be like last week
with this oline the steelers might have a fucking field day with us gah damn
cbs production has been very poor today
this sub is spoiled as hell tho why the hell are some of yall complaining when were up 10 and getting the ball to start the 2nd half on the road

ill take this shit every week
this subs annoying if we arent crushing the other team
what the fuck is our offensive line doing theyre traffic cones right now for the texans and oh boy stanley might be injured again just great here comes another game where lamar has to do literally everything for the offense
talk about keeping a team in it at the end of the half
refs gave them 3 points
texans are such pussies for taking a fg although i guess it was fourth and 15
oh i see the chiefs are clearly going to win lol
cbs needs to hurry and put this game on lol
damn judon almost had him
im fucking done with tavon lets draft slot cb
a sight all too familiar to us flocktavon young making a great defensive play and then limping off the field
the number of big names going down to injury today has me quite concerned for our boys and even more so now
they should ban turf
please fucking run
what are they cheering about a helmet to helmet hit lol
today is fucked ill die if lamar gets hurt
lamar showing elite composure rn
i get that the texans are running 8man boxes all day but do we only have one rush from an rb so far
i miss yanda
playcalling reminds me of the bills game too much trickery i guess were putting it on tape for the chiefs but we
both o lines look terrible dshaun must be use to by now
dang nice moves watson
big props to ward for letting that sack go and avoiding the horsecollar had both hands inside the jersey at the neckline
good gracious what a freaking escape by watson
already in fg range sick
lets go joker szn
tells you what they think of their chances today that theyd go for that
good shit elliot
lol bill obrien is fucking stupid
at least the texans failed on that 4th and 1
hell yeah
man my stream is sloow
lets get ittttt
lamar really making project pat work for that td lol great play though
pat looked like hes made of rubber
is is me or did joker just play that like e dub and force watson to call timeout
wait theres no crowd noise then where is all that cheering coming from
damn it i hate when they get first downs
wow that was sloppy no pressure and left wide open
pass rush is garbage when just 4
we need pash rush right now
whos fault was that on the deep pass elliott
thats fine respond right back
wheres the pass rush
i hope the downers here realize in the game of football both teams usually give up a touchdown or two a game not every game is gonna be 456 calm down everyone
fuck off baker we dont care about your book club
lamar looks unbelievably calm out there amazing how he continues to get better
i hope we invest in the online next year hate seeing lj run for his life
sam koch can secretly throw tucker can secretly catch i think we found our next qbwr duo
mr automatic
we arent sneaking up on anyone texans are facing 02 and theyre ready for us
how perfect is it to have a fort on defense
no fucking way this team is incredible
damn thought he was in lol glad we got that all the same
thats what im talking about d lj fort marlon
thats a td
lj taking over the game
i love marlo
marlooooooo
this game is about to get ugly cant help but feel terrible for deshaun he deserves so much better
fruit punch
pay peanut holy fuck what a play by fort theyre gonna show that all week
yeah thats going to be a td
definitely a tuddy awesome stuff pretty sure judon got blocked in the back on the rush too
tuddy all day
goddamn the defense does not look sluggish
td confirmed
i love marlon
lamar jackson fort
dang harrison is fast
what a pick
im gonna nut
god i love our corners
we feasting today bois
ballhawkin peters wow
mp juicemannnnnnn
after a slow start ravens are back baby mp juiceman in the house baby
marcus fn peters
dude should be a wr lol
lets fucking go marcus peters
juiceman
defense rolling now
about to be back to back years of having two all pro corners
holeeeee fuckkk what an int
deshaun looks scared against our d just like last year
mp juuuuuuiiiiceman
hell yeah d
yall have no faith
im so fucking glad weve got peters for a 5th rounder
mp juice man they thought it was sweet but it was really sour
this is a championship type defense turnovers are strongly correlated to super bowl runs
ravens mvp kaare vedvik
dear god i remember like 6 seasons where we didnt have a single wide receiver that could make that catch
lamar just felt bad that watt hasnt had many sacks lately and wanted him to feel good good guy lamar man
how much farther back is tucks fg target line than other teams
weirdly poor pocket presence there from lamar had an opening to his right but twirled into that sack
ronnie stanley is hurt
yanda come back
ronnie pls
online is awful today
lamar having louisville flashbacks with this o line play today
anthony averett is def our worst corner
why does it take literally our entire defense plus a couple camera guys to tackle watson
averett needs to be off the field right now
lmao fucking bullshit call
omg these calls
that ol is not ideal
soft as shit call
levine averrett having shit games
fucking home job
jesus christ averett is piss poor per the usual is their no free agent or practice squander out there
seeing averett out there is giving me flashbacks to last years browns loss god he is awful we need tavon back
what the fuck is that call
what in the world
id rather have canady than averrtt hes just horrible
what the everloving shit is going on with the refs on this drive
i think were a bit spoiled its the nfl were not going to dominate literally every playdrive of the game were up 10 at the half kc is down 8 we are an elite team but we arent perfect lets not lose sight of that
refs fucking called shit illegal contact then stop the clock
not getting points off of that turnover is rough
either flag us or keep the clock running wtf is a 4 second add
im mad but im also just plain confused wtf rule are the refs invoking here
blatant hold on judon right after the wiped sack
can someone get the oline motivated can we make some running lanes and get these backs going strong
we seem off offensive game plan seems off without the def td it would look a lot different at half hope we can adjust at half and settle some these guys dont look like they can play with our guys we should run them out of the place
we get the ball after the half just have to settle in more we know we have the talent
joe flacco kirk cousins
if theyre so disappointed in the run game how about running the ball more lol
boykin is much improved
harbaugh sucking on his mask looks so weird lol
is dobbins hurt is he active
exciting even when he gains one yard
when i drink stout we play questionably when i drink tequila we play consistent as fuck i know what i must do boys
teams are doing a better job of closing off the amount of space lamar has to work with
oh you thought he was down jk
wow what a play shades of ray rice vs cinci yearsago
how was that not pass interference
pi
4 sacks today o line butt today
yo o line is straight trash
roman needs to run some screens
tucker out here doing trick shots on his fgs now
237 sounds a lot better than 2310
really need to rally that ol during this defensive series
taking a second to to admire tucker that fg was beautiful close but most would not have made it
they are abusing tyree and brown whew
ravens should have swallowed their pride and brought back osemele oh well
if this stream drops audio one more time im going to report it
everyone bitch in about this team even the play calling is fine we are not kc down 11 to a fucking rookie
watson is a tough mf to bring down
nanny mcphee seems to always be getting in the backfield today still goin strong
omg averett is garbage how do you give that up
averett is literally so fucking bad please cut his ass and start tucker
picking on averett bad
averatt is just getting demoralised
averette is ass
yeah get averett off the fucking field
avarett is not good i agree you just have to feel bad for the guy though will be picked on all game ever since both marlon and mp caused turnovers
averett consistently gets beat
damn what a throw watson
oh fuck off trent green
lol pq leaping on top of everyone else

this is my pile
they fucking dogpiled him lmao
it looks like we put in jimmy for marlon and gave marlon slot duty back while young is out
averett is showing why hes the 4th option
its not that he sucks its just that hes not a onehalf and two option on a starting defense
this drive has felt like forever
ohhhh my gawd
now lets just grind the hell out of them for 10 minutes and end this with a td
mando
not sure why but ive got respect for jj his brother although good seems like a dirty player
watt has played really well credit where its due
big truzzzzzz
big boi no little boi
ingram
thats how you 4th down it baby
god i love this team so much
with the roundhouse kick lmao
errybody get in here we did a run block
kick that fucking bull lets fucking go
so everythings back to fine again
dis that dirty biiird gameplay i was promised
someone link the replay plz
harbaugh balls for calling a play like that
that was some tomfoolery play and i live for it
dang so many big name injuries today
why do i feel like 17 points still aint enough must be that cowboysfalcons game from earlier plus ill never count out watson
lmao hollywood dancing menacingly towards david johnson
a lamar td pass to hollywood to end this game would be absolutely pizza pie for me
jokerrrrrr
hes the jokaa baybeee
deshaun gonna make some money he keeps this up
warm up the bus
here comes the passrush
time to feed those running backs
unpopular opinion we extend ingram for 2 years
lamar throws a somewhat wobbly pass for a touchdown and lamar gets roasted and mahomes finally ties the chargers and he gets wow just wow
203 career start not bad for a running back
kc is scary but at the end of the day is just about getting to the playoffs and being hot at that time
texans damn lucky that was an inch from being a touchdown
jeez i forgot we play kc next week huge game
yeah challenge the spot he reached that fd
i like this challenge looked close and we can just use it as a timeout to figure out things anyhow
assert dominance go for it and go long to hollywood
thats how you do it
the fake fake
big dick harbs
gus is a gamer
gus could legit be a 1 on a bunch of teams
this is why you pound the rock they know its coming and cant stop it easier for oline to runblock than pass block too gus has earned more touches
lightning mcqueen leading the team in tackles again loving this guy
please explain why is this player disqualified i dont understand ty
tickets please


the bus will be departing soon
replay of foul
anybody know what just happened
i want harbaughs neck gaiter
why do they keep running to the sideline cmon
cant believe we didnt throw once on that drive
i hope the people saying go for it arent serious
super bowl confirmed
thank god for that graphic i wouldve never known that guy won mvp
the ravens have generated 22 pressures today
dobbins yesss

run of the day
dobbins drop the taco judon get in the freaking bus

texans have no heart left they do t give a fuck lol
i want a lamar touchdown
oof if kc loses to la theyre coming here fired up lol
ooo im so hyped for next week

dobbins needs to learn how to block
play calling seems to be a lil too cute right now
i dont like these play calls things feel very conservative right now
hollywood be frying niggas man lol butt ass ass naked out there
who the hell just said marlon needs to wake up the d with a big play damn sorcery
o line needs to step up but not as much as the officiating does i dont know how you miss the td live when its right in front of you and then the 2 illegal contact calls and the absurd pause to give the texans enough time to kick a fg is just inexcusable shit this crew shouldnt get another game this season
anyone concerned about the score is a 2019 era new ravens fan
o line is officially the weak link of team
rtexascuckoldcommunity
some of you became fans of the ravens last season and it shows
im not sure where all of the chastising is coming from these gameday threads are literally all just hot takes its what you came here for and its just the nature of these threads
its kind of depressing without crowd noise
defense was pathetic that drive
ravens 20

texans 7

refs 3
averett shareece wright chykie brown maurice canady and dominique franks are the same give up a 10 yard catch on 3rd down corner change my view
lets fuckin feast
broncos keeping it close
lol denver is really pushing the squealers
looking at all the injuries this week i hope our ravens will be safe
you had one job denver
thank god we play the giants at home metlife field is ending everybodys season
jimmy gets by with a lil help from his friends 3
good shit jimmy
great 1on1 stop by jimmy
good start lets get it
i swear the biggest cheat code for our offense is 5 wide but we barely ever do it smh
i love how long nfl commercial breaks are
is tavon young made of glass
wow well its our turn i guess what a terrible day for injuries man
looks like he came down on that left leg and the knee just flexed out to the side no bueno
he was limping off i bet hes ok
someone spiked the nfls gatorade stash with bone hurting juice apparently
young is made of glass
could be ok fingers crossed
yaaaas queen
queen is gonna be a beast
fuck i thought the ball was out but it was just johnsons red shoes
how many times am i gonna have to watch mahomes play cornhole smh
run the fucking ball
lol run plz
does lamars balls look zippier today to anyone else like last year they looked solid but today the just shoot out
apparently everyone in here thinks they would be a better oc than roman
the oline doesnt exist today
i miss yanda
yanda plz comeback
what the fuck is our oline doing right now the texans are using them like turnstiles
why do teams still use turf jesus
can lamar not hit the hard ass fake field with his throwing hand cool thanks
the texans are playing great defense
on 3rd 7 why do we have 3 players running routes underneath the sticks
texans are playing well dont forget theres another team on the field we looked good enough
whats up with the fans on here making crazy takes after 2 drives same thing happened last week but for the defense
damn everyone in heres a better play caller than greg roman i guess from the sound of it
that was impressive by watson to break free from ward
ward just got daddied
jesus what a hell of an escape
earl who
fantastic fucking stand
holy fuck what a terrible decision
it pumps me up that our offense is so good teams have to take shots like that 4th and 1 and our defense is tough enough to shut it all down
lmaooo that was a ballsy move
joooooker
opposing teams feel the needto be aggressive with us just like the ravens when we played kc i dont blame them going for it risky but it has to be done against high scoring teams
great clean stop

we got to punish these stupid decisions lets get 7
if we dont get 7 off this imma be pissed
so our offense is so freaking scary teams are running bad 4th downs in the hope they keep us off the field feels damn good
fuck yes
thats my blocking tight end fighting
pat ricard what a unit
big bois gotta eat what a play by ricard
what a snag
project pat
great catch
pat really redeemed him self from last week there
my erection enters the chat
going for it on 4th in your own territory is a bold move against this offense
awesome catch by ricard but poor boyle can never get in the endzone
captain ricard made it so
hopefully tavon can come back this year
cmon jimmy
fuck that was a nice catch by ricard
yasss its lamar
seahawks gonna bring cam back to reality tonight i think
thats a big yikes
thats on elliot
smhhh
i never understood why some underestimate deshaun hes one of the best qbs in the league
duuuuv
ingram heard yall talking shit
put tucker out there in the slot
going from joe to lamar feels illegal
holy shit romeo crennel still exists
i love this belichick commercial lolll
feel like he couldve picked up the first
clean game so far no penalties no turnovers no sacks or pretty close to none

any turnover is gonna be big
d needs to step up no pressure at all
i swear i saw someone comment that we need marlon to force a fumble literally a few minutes ago
who needs a national game when you get kevin harlan
how is that not a td
thats 6 come on
humph with his finishing move
under review
lets gooooooo awesome
thats a td
i really need harbaugh to challenge this for my fantasy
bro imagine thinking youre gonna beat the ravens while giving up defensive touchdowns
lets go marlo
thats a td boys
humphrey graduated from the peanut tillman school for dbs in case anyone was wondering head of his class too
pay marlon
all pro marlo
fumble td
marlon hammer fist humphreys
goddamn that was an effort at the very limits of human capability for fort to get that in there amazing
tucker practicing his bending techniques on these kicks
mega hustle from fort

all right defense dont let up should be well rested after all the tv breaks and reviews
ya know arizona looks great this year
queen in coverage over a wr
mp
interception
fully erect
this team is fucking good
holy fuck peters
marcus fucking peters
juiceman
what a fucking play
mp juiceman
i love mp juiceman
holy fuck what a fucking pick
mp grape juice man
oof
oh my word
our defense is hungry
juice
mpjuiceman looking like ed reed
what a game so far after that slow start
juiceman
our elite corners showing out today
so what edge we trading for
td halftime td game
now its time to step on their throats and end this before the half lets go boys
lets gooooooo

chance here to pull a belichick special doubledip before end of half and we start the 3rd with the ball
mp ditched his man in the flat and double backed for the snag such a sneaky fuck love it
holy crap that int was fucking beautiful
peters took a page out of ed reeds book with that int
watt is destroying obj
i want you all to just take a moment to appreciate this special roster of guys we have right now dont take it for granted
i miss yanda
not today watt any other day is fine
not stanley
online playing like total dog shit today
oh fuck oh fuck not stanley please
averett is a bum
are you fucking kidding me
queen is an absolute beast
averett is such a fucking liabilty
fucking averett you know hes going to the sideline
lol wut
wtf averrett is allowed his field what a joke
fucking dammit you cant let deshaun do that
having not seen averette for awhile i completely forgot how trash he is
wtf just happened
houston a bunch of pussies
not worried couple of gifts from the refs there
lol thats bullshit
that one weak and simply wrong illegal contact call on the sack made the whole drive happen but that doesnt excuse every other play that was awful
refs were dogshit down the stretch that illegal contact on the sack was soft as fuck
this texans team is so trash were keeping them in the game god it must suck to be a fan in houston
that was legit you cant delay the game because the ref fucks up same thing as moving the chains if they arent set the refs can pause the game because they fucked up not the other team
dear god i hope uncle eric is on the phone calling someone to play corner next week
im still really confused why the refs gave them a free timeout not suspicious at all
were up 10 but only have 5 rushes by rbs i understand letting the defense pick their poison but you cant just allow them to get us out of our game
hey greg think youre gonna run it more than 5 times in the second half
pass protection has been crap need to run some drawsscreens or roll lamar out to slow them down
did dobbins get a single snap in that half
once again the coaches are forgetting that the ravens are a runfirst team
anyone else want to see some more 2 te sets and jk dobbins in the 2nd half

we need to slow this pass rush down
also our dline has gotten pretty good pressure but watsons athleticism is phenomenal
dont know why a lot of you are angry deshaun is going to make plays hes arguably a top 5 guy and were so lucky d hop aint playing with the texans anymore texans are bound to make more bone headed tos and bad plays we got this guys
its never worth to return kickoffs anymore because all of the flags and the small likelihood of actually getting past the 25
maybe the gus bus is like the texans kryptonite
ah yes the ol akron pros
dobbins staying up after that contact was amazing
dobbins aw jeez looks like you got me

jk
that was ray rice like holy shit
jk ray rice
good read and play switch by lamar
dobbins good
wow thats was ray rice chills man spooky
obvious pi dude could be kissing mandrews
how was that good coverage
excuse me i forgot what does an oline do
scaring me there tuck
that was snuck in there damn
thank god we have tucker
almost had to burn down a village there for a second
llama gonna need some ice packs after this game
ok wtf is going on with our o line
god wont allow tuck to miss i swear
missing yanda so bad
this iol man
dude if our line is this bad call different routes spread them 5 wide call a screen do literally anything different jesus
i would really like fluker to start at guard for now he wouldnt get bullied in the run game
well its a good thing he overthrew that lol
wink bout to send some heavy pressure on the right side
i do think we see fluker at rg next week but yall saying brown jr looks bad and yanda made him good have apperantly forgotten who hes going against damn near every play id like to see a tackle playing next to a rookie guard that doesnt get eaten alive by jj watt
even with that sack watson looks like hes covered in oil lmao
why is averett on the field
fucking averett
averett cant keep up
what a fucking throw by watson
cut averett hes always the culprit
averett needs to be cut
picking on averett alllllll day
averett sucks
cant let them get more than a fg here with the amount of penalties and tfl we have had lets shut it down
avarett is already playing garbage time
please bench averett asap
line is starting to get pressure
queen be like i want the tackle too
we need tavon back man
yeah we do not have to do this averett experiment just play jimmy
i miss lamar 3
man i hope we can pound the rock and burn some clock on this next possession
i love winks scheming fuckin 8 defenders on the los
we need to put the texans away now this is the way
lol people are still roasting averette
herbert has 3 more completions than mahomes and 125 more yards
cactus jack sent me
its early but our ol just doesnt look the same in the run game yanda retiring skura not being 100 are 2 reasons why both opposing defenses have sold out to stop the run as well

as the new ol builds cohesion i think theyll start to dominate on the ground again
did lamar just reverse summersault
snead has the need for speed
i really like snead iv he shows up every game for something and that was a toughass run after catch
murray runs so weird
kyler murray has me worried if we meet them in the sb hes so much better this year
the best part about lamar is how much he just loves the game and everyone included breaks two tackles falls over the guys gets up helps them up and hugs both of the texans players
this just in lamar jackson sandbagging so that he could play a full football game
ingrammm
hell yeah coach lets go for it
so much for eating clock but fuck it lets goooooooo
not bad for a rb
he just cobra kaid their logo dayam
hell yeah coach lets go for it
cant hang thats fucking baltimore football right there
ingram was so hyped
thats how you do a 4th and 1
roundhouse
he busted roundhouse kick
we some kind of 1920s football squad
absolutely amazing blocking should be game lfg
ingram i love you

roman and harbaugh what a play call hats off
big boi run
the hays in the barn
we own this bitch
for all the problems with the oline were still firing on all cylinders and beating these mfers handidly
i love this team
i am suddenly a wildcat fan but only for one play
just when you thought this offense has done it all 4th down wildcat for 30 you have got to be kidding
lets get a 3 and out we can basically end the game

lets gooooo d
when deshaun has time he is absolutely surgical
calais there showing why he is great
elliott has been playing great safeties have been refreshingly good these last two games
stop turtling d
yeah we cant play like theres 2 min left
the pressure today hasnt been bad honestly
geeeeeez elliot
joker
is watson blind lol i dont think it couldve been more obvious that we were sending the house
please eat the clock
not to be greedy but another lamar td would really save my fantasy team
gotta tighten up that coverage and pass block a bit better for kc next week other than that solid display of football for us
down by 17

x200b

kick a field goal
how are you not going to go for this
how the fuck do they not show a replay thats absurd cbs
that was a crazy play call
lmao im so glad we want to demoralize them and go for it
that scheduling does suck for houston i agree
hope houston destroys the steelers next week
now we are just demoralizing them
gus looks incredible right now
chargers about to score a td

they on the 3
damn gus is the closer
gus bus is so good
having gus is almost dirty we run ingram and dobbins all game then we send in gus against a completely wore defense
did anyone even see what got 90 ejected
235105 on the road
cunningham has a done a good job containing lamar credit where its due
running out of bounds on back to back plays not smart football
lamar td here pls
in the least weird way possible deshaun watson has got some smooth skin
kick the fg go up 3 and lets roll it out
if we score another td im gonna be 1 point off on the lucky guess thread thats gonna suck
its crazy to think about how we havent lost a single game since the browns week 3 might change next week but a 15 game winning streak is insane
i love kevin harlan
jk dobbins is electric
get him down

lmaooooo
yo thats gotta be demoralizing as fuck
dobbins
these little flashes of jks ability makes me hyped for how he is going to develop in this offense
ravens have 223 rush yards texans held up until the 4th and then boom
we almost have 4 guys with 50yrds rushing wonder if thats ever happened before
mahomes just picked up 3rd 20 on a run wtf
oh god here comes the pat mahomes comeback
settle for a tie cowards
fuck the chargers

were gonna do it by ourselves
lamar 37 for 46 398 5tds





m



























our o like is playing like shit but lamar is so good that hes only been sacked once
whew i feel so much better after we didnt score a touchdown on 100 of our possessions

lol yall need to chill
is watson covered in oil
the texans player placed the ball and then the ref kicked it backwards i guess that means they get a free timeout to get a fg
meh 10 up at the half ill take it
our oline couldnt block a light breeze today let alone a dline led by jj watt what the fuck are they doing
get avarett out ffs
bro fuck this announcer saying that was a penalty but the shit on andrews wasnt
god mahomes is going to fucking expose averett
niggas keep trying to tell me edwards is just a product on the offense dude is good
probably the most human ive ever seen lamar play
this was the weirdest blow out ever we had to try hard for it a lot of the other ones felt effortless
the hay is in the barn
i know our play calling has been questionable and the oline sucks today but shit are we spoiled with so many people complaining about not blowing out a good team
the other team is still allowed to score guys
fuck this call it a tie and try again next week

save the knees
tavon can sneeze and get hurt
18 games in 4 seasons for tavon if hes out for the season
literally the same start as the browns game go up 100 have a shitty defensive possession

tell me whats next
this offensive line is so bad
play fluker and mekari
we need to put a big hit on watson weve allowed him too much time and space to build confidence
kinda feel bad for the texans right schedule hard af kc us then pittsburgh next week damn
not surprising they picked up that 3rd and long on averett get him off the god damn field
30 to 13 but i feel like weve been playing pretty bad idk lol
steelers have a lot of game left the tv will cut to our game at the start wont they
steelers really blowing this shit lmao
broncos fucking suck
well if theres anything we learned its that the steelers defense is overrated
something bad teams have in common not blocking obvious free rushers haha
steelers almost lost to the jeff driskel broncos spooky
hope ingram goes off today
strap yourselves in here we go
kevin harlan lets gooo
campbell just reached out and grabbed that runner otherwise he was going at least several more yards
lol way to hold em jimmy

jimmy say heeelp
always hated jets sweeps
levine is just the best
ahh lamar shouldve probably tried that 5050 ball down the field on the right hand side
theyre clearly scared of watt disrupting the rushing offense
welp there it is
tavon looks like hes in a lot of pain
no tavon
ffs we were just talking about avoiding injuries thankfully he seems to be ok
goddamnit who put kneebreaking shit in all the fields this week
tavon pls no be hurt
meanwhile lmfao falcons they are the biggest choke artists in the nfl
walk it off young one
i had a bad feeling the rampant injury bug thats been hitting the league would bite us today
fucking week 2

edit i mean the amount of injuries around the nfl has been rough this week
itll buff out
anthony averrett
yas queen
queen with the hustle
why arent we even trying to run the ball
oline looks like ass
this oline play is terrible
rip tavon
at least he can walk thats good
hollywood could have blocked watt and was like lol no
all these injuries today has me fucking spooked for the lamar running game
maybe our front office will dial up some trades or something for the oline on the level of how they retooled the defense midseason last year
we had a slow start to the texans last year and still put up 41
always said o line is overrated the reason why teams dont get sacks on the ravens is because of lamar
let the ravens gain momentum theyre just powering up
we have 3 stellar rbs for sure dont hand the ball off once in a quarter
let lamar get a feel for what they are doing and he will adjust a bit
okay that was impressive
thats it im getting a beer
this is going to be a very fun game battle of crazy athletic qbs
evade 100
deshaun lamar jackson watson
that was honestly best case scenario because it could have easily turned into a horse collar
come on dont be shy slander the ravens defense some more
cant give the ravens offense great field position getting a td here would be huge
why do teams always try dumb ass 4th down attempts on us hilarious
hell yea boys lets get 7
watson loving the jump pass
bob is such a dunce
fucking huuuuuuuuuuuge
hell yes defense
how idiotic lmao
that was not a good decision two weeks in a row teams getting too cute on us
this game is already waaay better than the denver pittsburgh game
front 7 looks light years better
we just got the ball within justin tucker field goal range
it was actually a good thing that no one wanted to tackle watson on that play
man with all the speed on this offense boyle looks sooooo slow
you owed us that ricard
feel better now boys
ricardoh yea
lamar 2 td run yes
love this drive
patty ricard thanks bob
touchdownnnnnn ravens
great play from project pat
much better play calling lock clockwork when we on
thank you sweet lord baby jesus
the texans wanted to be us so bad by going for it on 4th down
has dobbins played a snap today
flip over to the wft at commercial just in time to watch haskins get pancaked

edit scary terry appears
bill obrien mvp
good shit ricard
first td

more to come
imagine using analytics and probabilities to get an edge in a football game only to see the effort benefit the other team congrats youre bob
i havent heard anything about it so im assuming clark still has the green dot
our run d is looking decent
also i do hear crowd noises pumped in do you guys not hear it
hell of a blown coverage
yuck
double fuck
if watson had time that was a td
does anyone know what pacific time the game is
need the offense to come out big this drive let the defense get some light under their feet and get back on top of things
this pass rush is gonna suck so hard next week
tavon being out does actually hurt us
ate a whole wedge of triple cream brie and its got me fucked up
fuck earl thomas bum ass for costing us 15 mil this year
bro ingram takes a fucking beating when he has the ball
oh my god if lamar starts working voice inflection into his repertoire thats it call it the mans in total sheriff bradyrodgers territory
lamar to tucker is now my ultimate dream play to see recorded in a regular game scorebook officially somehow
all i want this season besides a super bowl is a tucker tuddy
what cant tucker do
hollywood
hollywood brown making catches like hes 69
lets go is it just me or does hollywood always land funny when he goes up for a catch
fuck running hes gonna be lamar rodgers from now on
tucker for wr
doctor my eyes just saw a pass from jackson to brown
lamar throwing way offscreen its going to hollywood
that was a fucking zinger to andrews but good defense
little too much on that throw
marlooooooooo
also fruit punch
did i just say i want a to yes i did
marlooooooo
yaaasssss give me them turnovers
who in here said we needed a turnover td what a prediction
humph punch
build that fort and watch it stand
marlon
humphrey is such a beast
marlonjalen
hes in come on
texans cant be serious
its not a td
the ball hit the pylon before he went out
oh wait we dont have to challenge because all turnovers are reviewed and they review the entire play this review will end with us kicking a pat
lamar jackson lj fort mchenry is in baltimore lj fort illuminati confirmed
lettss fockin goooooo

the wink defense has nasty punches peanut did it all the time too
all these great players were going to have to pay
went the bathroom guess that was a mistake
for you ravens fans to give some context here the wr that caught the ball does this so often he gives us flash of hopes and then does this and now will not play for the next 4 games probably lmoa
thank god that def looked like a legit td
im surprised but ill take it td
thats a touchdown
lets goooooooo ravens


houston blaming lack of energy on lack of crowd noise pretty sure houston would be silent regardless after that last td
marcus motherfucking peters
bruh
what a catch
holy fucking highlight reel
i think the d heard the shit you all were talking
mp juicemane
mp juiceman
mpjuiceman
thats a catch by a mile
good afternoon houston the juice man is here
oh yeah dont forget we have a defense
juice man
we starting to heat up
what a pick
marcus gonna start clowning them looks like lamar aint playing in the fourth
m p juice mayynnneeee
mp juiceman
mp juiceman god we are so lucky to have two stud corners
people still try to act like we dont have 2 of the top 5 corners
mp juiceman mp juiceman mp juiceman
turnovers win games turnovers lose games we on the right side of those tos
gimmie that
juice man juice man
yesssss what a catch
lj fort and mp masking our oline getting manhandled and the lack of a pass rush
td here and after the half and cruise lol
eat
we are fucking scary i love it
bud light guy needs to brown bag that beer
lmao they making deshaun watch the pick
we dont stop the clock for out of bounds anymore
i love peters so much
gotta feel bad for watson honestly dudes just going to end up like andrew luck
i fucking love peters and humphrey duo keep them together
mp stands for magic powers with how he caught that oo
we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs
unfortunately for the texans theyre stuck playing the ravens on allmadden difficulty
man obj is having a rough start to the season garret last week and now watt
im not used to seeing stanley and brown getting pushed like this
well that wasnt good
stanley no
fuck it let tucker try it from ther e
what the fuck oline
o line pls
so i guess stanley now has injuries to 3 parts of his body
we cant lose stanley that could be devastating to the offense
do we actually have an offensive line
ok the entire oline needs to step up now without stanley
can yanda start eating again maybe he can make a comeback for week 4 or 5 just need him to get in lineman shape
the oline needs help idk why edc thought a third round rookie was gonna fill in for yanda
lmao an interception and the texans are gonna score
bullshit flag
averett is fucking trash
again come on
learn to tackle
what shit way to end the first half
averted shouldnt even be on the team anymore
rather have levine play corner than averette
remember when averett jumped over the fumble in kc and missed the ball entirely
our ilb is our best pass rusher good lord
shit needs to be said in the locker room shit needs to be said
damn our o line looking like a bunch of beanbags
huh
wtf was that
we stayed really healthy last year you get some soft spots exposed if guys start getting dinged up
why did they give them time
fuck off come on
o line needs to be addressed asap
fucking unreal
actual bs but whatever
offense is just not getting it together defense keeping us in this game lets hope oline can get it together and lamar comes out angry in the second half to put together a td drive
this o line chris jones and the chiefs are gonna be licking their chops looking at this on game film

we need to get this shit straight

thank fuck lamar can throw cause the run game has gone to shit
when they stop the clock to call a penalty which ends up getting declined dont they have to impose a ten second run off
boykin is a tight end now i guess
boykins not a te
lamars composure today

but id like to see him scrambling to avoid those sacks a little more bully them into submission
these announcers called deshonn eliot a c and boykin a te so far
watt is a legit superstar his presence is felt this game
gus aka the bus
the ol isnt helping but the playcalling has left a lot to be desired so far
this is exactly why we should keep feeding the running backs
our backs are the best downhill runners in the game
omg close up of harbaugh eating his mask
feed gus
we had 3 lead blockers on that play and 3 players on the defense were around lamar unblocked within 3 yards
ray rice flashback
need i say im throbbins for dobbins
amazing play by dobbins staying up
i want to see a bomb to hollywood lol
dobbins is such a great pick
way to go jk
ray rice vibes
andrews almost got a hug for a td
thats a pi if the roles were reversed
yeah the oline is a worry
dude hollywood was wide open
pi
andrews wanted to moss him so bad i would have nutted
i have faith in phillips but hes just not it yet
phewwww still fucking got it
this fucking oline already
o line is booty
tucker really scared me there
o line stand between the rusher and lamar pls
i miss yanda
thank god for tucker
offensive line straight dog ass
orlando let that blitz right in untouched smh
still fucking got it
is our ol bad or is houstons dl good
the oline is lookin like swiss cheese
just seeing how close he can kick it to the upright without touching it thats all totally intentional
these field goals are killing me total yards edge and 2 turnovers we should be up a lot more than 13
it cant just be the loss of yanda somebody on that offensive line has regressed
tucker just tucking it in
ngl im scared lamars gonna get hurt if they dont fucking block for him lamar getting hurt could potentially end the season
orlando brown looked good playing next to yanda last year but now holy shit
we arent used to winning and it not being close in all honesty the team needs to overcome and pull through games like this this is what sharpens our blades
i hate looking in this sub and everyone being so negative when we are up two possessions
mcphee almost blew that up
watson just fucking go down jesus christ
lol there were so many humans in that pile
our front 7 is going to wreak havoc against a less athletic qb
anthony averett not anthony everett
averett jesus christ do your job
get averett out of there bruh
averett suuuucks
averett shows up just to get fucked next play
averett is a horrible football player
averett is pain
what ever happened to iman marshall has he been injured
dog pile
do we have any other corners aside from averette who could sub for him
this drive is giving me agita
guess ill take it this team kinda playing like butt and drain the quarter for 3
can someone explain to me why bernard pollard hates harbaugh link
im ready for one of the cbs off the practice squad averett has been trash since we drafted him
we jumped boo
prince amukamura is a fa

yeah hes too good to be a fourth corner though
oh look now they have a manageable 3rd down
lol who laughed there
great job d
good stop
houston out here trying to throw on humphrey good way to not score touchdowns
long td drive please even a long fg drive would be nice
still pissed off they replaced jake from state farm into a handsome and fit man i miss the old one
we need a long fucking drive like its nobodys business
jackson is so entertaining to watch
slippery like a rain drop
she is so fine
slippery as a raindrop

poetry
i need a houdini play
did not know bout andrews diabetes huh thats crazy
jj chillplz
jj watt is not a human being
lowkey forgot how good jj swat is lol
lets go
lets go
fucking ingram
i fucking love this team
what a call g ro
the ravens are my favorite team
bruh my jaw is on the fucking floor lmao holy shit
was that a direct snap to ingram
best blocking all day what a time for it to come
dagger
big truzzzzzzzz
ingrammmmmm what a play god damn that was sexy
20 baby
what did that net do to you ingram
gro is a handsome husky genius
yes sirrrrrrrrrrrrrr
what a clean run jesus gotta love ingram
meet me outside the bankwhen we get back
damn jake from state farm buff af
bob so mad he took the mask off
still 10 mins to play lets get a to
texans are known for having a bad oline and we have given watson lots of time
watching the ravens play prevent towards the end of games always infuriates me its so bad
block the fg plzz
deshon desean
sacked
i traded sammy watkins to my buddy for hollywood like 20 mins before kickoff and now watkins is hurt holy fuck i just got that one off
props to faribairn for also staying clear of the illness affecting nearly all kickers this year and being pretty money for his team today


bruce lee
damn easy on my qb fucker
clock killing td drive here we go
god i love football
we going

good thing the refs couldnt see that blatant hold from andrews
not a bad challenge gives them a to to go over 4th and 1
knee wasnt down
good challenge if dont get it its basically a to
he got it
how the heck didnt they spot that as a 1st lol
god we are lucky
yup houstons done
gus fucking ramming them
time to load up the gus bus
tha wheels on tha bus go round and round
gus bus ride the man
i know these are garbage time yards but i love edwards
damn gus showing off
makegusbusthestarter
gus bus taking us to w street
gus lives for the 4th quarter
blacklock dude is lucky he has an l in there
they just ejected blacklock
imagine having like 5 guys we trust to run the ball amazing

this fucking team guys
member back in the first quarter omfg were gunna lose

relax
gus 79 ypc edwards
can they stop going out of bounds
ok so it was a 5 minute drive with a fg still works
wasted a minute dumbass outside runs there
another week it feels good to be a raven
i like the implications
pick 6 coming up
houston sports fans all collectively gathered outside the stadium as you can hear the boos
rgiii time
so whos our player of the game the whole team felt like a collective effort
its rg3 time again lmao
that will just about do it yeah
j k all day
oh yeah dobbins is gonna be nice
jk
holy shit jk
im so fucking hungry for next monday
who screaming get down
ride em dobbins
dobbins is a great open field runner the turf monster almost got him there but he was crazy in college
pray that greg roman doesnt try and fancy it up
lamar looks a half step slower since he bulked up overall probably a good thing but we may not see another bengals type play
ray rice
watson a bitch begging for flags like that
hey jk maybe block somebody
listen i had a really hard week im gonna need you guys to chill with the doom and gloom unless were down 20 points in the last 2 mins of the fourth
looks like were feeling the loss of yanda
seriously pass defense wake up
71 was way up field on that is he eligible
poor tavon young is made of glass
brown won on that route gotta give him a chance
fruit punch
whats the point of having ingram if we dont use him cant just deep ball everything
got the best cb duo but also the worst cb in the league to balance it out
why add time this is rigged af
pass interference 100
refs robbed us of 7 wtfff
danny lee jesus d j fluker please
dont get me wrong i love our usual offense but this type of offense hits different
lets fucking go boys and girls
dobbins is new but he should of got that block for lamar coulda been a 1st
tavon just cant stay healthy
that dude is fragile as fuck jesus
stupid drive but points
ok the missed tackles were probably just martindale playing 4d chess for good field position
anyone else think this defense could be historically good
complete to tucker
we need to run the ball
was that a catch
oline keeping the texans in the game
opening gameplay was bad this game texans got rocked by the chiefs run game we came out passing the biggest downfall of this team is game planning and play calling same shit happened last season
nice to see the refs only robbed us of 4 points instead of 7
we keep scoring and have no turnovers and everyone is screaming at our offense
should have kept carr
lets go offense lets put a nice drive together
why are we running outside the tackles right now running out the clock is far more important than scoring
run the score up
bob paid the refs smh
damn refs hate you guys too must be an afc north thing
i know were winning but there is plenty to improve on right now

lamar had an open run lane for a first but instead threw it offtarget to hollywood in the end zone lamar in general is accurate today but his pocket presence is off

line is trash both offense and defense

offensive playcalling is offrhythm no dobbins little andrews extremely poorly done chance at end of half to capitalize on peterss pick

we better come out with a fire under us
if they dont go for it theyre throwing in the towel
im more worried about staying healthy that i am winning this one i mean i want the dub but want everyone to finish the game healthy even more these 1pm games have been brutal with some huge injuries
unrelated but can someone explain the bills hype to me they had the easiest schedule ever last year and this year theyve scraped by the jets and are losing to the dolphins theyre a slightly above average team at best
aww denver finding a way to screw it up
fucking denver
okay rsvens time to reclaim first place
me before the season denver with the help of talented rookies such as jerry jeudy and with drew lock as qb will be a legit contender for the playoffs


me now
ok can we just end this trash pittsburgh game and get to our coverage
hell yeah contractual obligations
im so afraid of todays match and not because of the match up but because of all the injuries around the league like people dropping all over the place smh
i love being in the zone for the game this week and not having to jump through ten hoops to watch the game
how are yall watching the game any streaming services
it is really good to hear kevin harlan
purple and white is such a sexy combo
in other news herbert is starting
here we go
hey do you guys think mark andrews will be a raven long term to buy or not buy a jersey
good 3 and out there
3 and out baby
imagine punting on 4th 1
we suck at sweeps
lets fucking go
get a turnover and get that momentum going
alright we can just start the game for real now
time to wake up guys
cmonnnn tavon down nooooo
and hes gone again
fuck

at least hes walking
oh no another injury
oh tavon
fuck tavon young hurt again
oof that definitely popped out slightly
call ed reed i know hes bored and not doing anything right now for old times sake ed
dude if he is injured again idk how we can keep him next year
knee sprain lets hope be strong tavon
tavon young is injured again god fucking damnit this guy is so frustrating to root for
maybe tavon will be ok
ok ill admit it through 1 game plus a quarter i was wrong about queen dude is a stud and i cant wait to see him develop
yas queen
queen kept fighting
dt brandon williams is dressed but backup justin ellis started the drive and just went out for derek wolfe something to watch jonasshaffer
anyway i can watch the game without getting dmca notice my mom got one for last weeks game and it freaked her out lol
where was the protection i like jj watt except now
who remembers 2013 when we were literally ecstatic for first downs
terrible play
that guy with cleats same color as the ball got me excited for no reason
lol are we gonna run the ball
i hate the head to head flag but how was that not a penalty
nice block by boykin
guys we will adjust remember last year when we played them
run the ball
guys its the first quarter calm down
that was a good throw
fuck it throw it to andrews every play no one can stop him
lol he did not need to hurdle at all though just go around
the cbs broadcast is fuckin awful we keep missing the start of plays
where tf is our oline
boykin again
looks like boykin might have a day
alrighty i am scared as shit
big first down
were rolling now
dobbins ingram gus
the way lamar throws is art
well at least doubtful means its probally a knee sprain and hell be back at some point
we dont run the ball anymore apparently
o line give lamar a second plz
pound the rock
i get so worried when lamar runs lol i feel like his mother
lamar i iove you
roby is out there headhunting wtf every single tackle hes going headfirst like shazier
holy fuck free rusher on every play
why is hollywood in the backfield
got tipped i think
flat
take your points brick by brick
jesus fuck
bruh
just a nice job my deshaun hes a more likeable big ben
i miss suggs
its one thing to get outran by watson but to get stiffarmed by him come on lol
ravens d just got lamard
gotta be honest that was impressive
hes greased up with oil and butter
gotta get him down but honestly that kind of pressure no matter how experienced watson is has to rattle him on some level
cant believe he wasnt whistled down i think ward let go
queen is the smart one and not going for the kill to make him throw it out
how tf did we let him go lmao
fuck lmao watson is legit
gotta stop this here
fuck off the field fuckers
lol i love our guys but he made us look silly there
bruh did they just call elliot a corner
any known streams for the out of towners
i get watson is slippery but damn dude tackle the man you practice against lamar
big oof
what call was that
bob things
fuck yeah
bill obrien gonna bill obrien
d is playing their asses off we arent sacking but the pressure is for sure getting there dbs doing the damn thang too
and this is when we pile on that was a mistake
wasnt queen i dont think
fucking bowser got thrown like a toddler that is not how you get the big money extension
what in the fuck was that call i mean go ravens but damn so dumb
wink def knew they were gonna go for it and took the timeout
great screen play
nice set up on the screen
lamar is throwing darts
interesting to see if dobbins gets the touch here at the 1

edit gus bus
man i thought he was gonna get there
boyle looked so dejected that he didnt get in
touchdown ricard
ricard making up for last week
touchdown ravens
cool
just run the ball
solid drive lamar throwing lasers
yoooooooooo
what a catch damn son
thank you bob
richard is dat boi
damn akins a big dude
come on defense work hard to get lamar the ball back
wake me up when the playoffs start this scrub watson wont be there
a moving presnap defense will typically be a good one add the talent in and youve got a great defense
whose the person out there responsible for coming up with m words to rhyme
where tf was marlon running
llama looks sad
fuck
ffs you gotta get ahead of that throw they just got 36 yds
wake up d
come on lets get a to
this is bullshit
fells is killing us
ugh no thnk u
okay yea that definitely shouldve been an ineligible man downfield
defense forgot how to defense
i miss tavon already
baker belongs in a book club
levine out of his depth back to back he should only be a special teams player
mark andrews time
can anyone comment on how the chiefs are looking
was that duvernays first career catch
jackson is such a pimp
who gets ball at halftime
looks like this year lamar is going to be much more of a passer than runner

more practical but not going to lie im going to miss the nutty rushing attack
coaching adjustment lamar doesnt always have his mouth guard in when hes handing it off defense can easily key on that
hollywood
nice catch tuck
we need some trick plays to get tucker in at wr


s odviously
hollywooooooooooooood
lol justin tucker the legend
hollywood
hollywood

massive first down we need a touchdown here
i get the feeling they wanted ingram as the vet to be the primary ball carrier against a texans d line led by watt and out for some revenge from last year
am i the only one noticing mark ingram being open asf on those fake runs where he goes short to the side like why not even try that
fun fact i still have to mute the tv when jt kicks i know hes mr automatic but im still scarred for life from hauschka sp and cundiff
lol fox for cardswft just called watson vs jackson an nfc showdown
i dont understand why dobbins hasnt been in more he looked good last week i hope they get him involved in the second half
fuck i love marlon hes always forcing fumbles
harbs had the red flag in his hand challenge coming up
oh lort lj fort
fruit punch
marlon humprey perfected the peanut punch
of course it was humphrey who punched it out
punch master marlo
hold that ball tight when humphrey is around
looked like he got in
holy shit
snowball is about to get extra snacks tonight
aaaaand hes short by a yard damn kevin
whats under review to see if its a touchdown
td
yo that wendys pretzel burger looks sus
can someone explain the fruit punch to me apparently i missed a meme
blanket fort
ok everyone take a breath now we got this
more good news chiefs are getting cooked by justin herbert

building the fort in the end zone
were taking no prisoners
im glad that were getting the train going but can we just appreciate that it wasnt dan fouts that was officiating when this happened
buy von miller for the low edc
we gotta knock watson on his ass
charles tillman looks at humph highlights and probably smiles
fucking peters
yooo
allpro punch out by marlonhumphrey ravens
mp juicemannnnnnn
mp juiceman
mp juice man
yeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhh
mp fucking juiceman
my god is that clean
what a pick
odell in shambles just got shivers down his dang spine
the defense has finally woken up haha
i might cry guys
yall thirsty have a damn juice box
get that sorry offense off the field
what a fucking catch by mp juice man most receivers couldnt make that catch
ravens need to pay lamar
that was incredible
marcus peters is a fucking hawk
what a pick
holy shit
i wanna see hollywood in open space more
stuntin on these hoes
mp juiceman lets go out there and get a td before the half
woooooo
what a fucking pick
pick 6 shawty
our defense may not be our all time best but it is fun as fuck
score here then get the ball first in the 2nd half
watson tried to break that tablet
mp juice man
peterssssss
hey deshaun we aint the fucking chiefs you aint throwing that shit easy on us
watts just damn good
too many sacks smh
i know its jj but obj is getting burned
qb1 is pissed at that line
jj watt is great when healthy lamar jackson is not bad for a runningback tell me something i didnt know
orlando brown is getting bullied
where is jacksons protection dang jj watt is good and handsome
jj watt is good relax guys
again wtf
fuck im filthy with our oline weak weak weak
my god this oline lmao
im cri
at least we get the ball back at half
man our ol is struggling today
lmao pathetic protection

gotta call faster routes if they cant protect lamar better than this
please stay healthy
greg roman forgot his specialty is running the ball
they are pinning their ears back need to call a screen pass or draw to ease that pressure
fucking finally
its okay to miss watson once hes crazy slippery just stay on him
if the oline showed up today wed be up like 30
wheres jimmy smith i hate having averett out there
the oline has been atrocious but god bless lamar and understanding that he cant give the ball away
defensive

rookie

of

the

year
bruh how we about to let watson do this and get momentum going into half
averett more like ayy catch it
anthony come on man
very nice sack
get averett outta there dude is a liability
please let that flag be on houston
theyre blitzing every play just start calling screens until they soften up
averett is not very good man
you would never guess averett is a former alabama db by looking at his play in the nfl
what the ever loving fuck was that bullshit
soits still 207 right


damn only up 10 with a fumble return td and pick
put in mekari or somebody on the line we need some stability there
we made good adjustments at the half last week lets hope we do here
why we passing so much wheres the run game
up 10 at the half despite a shakey olinerun game play and we get the ball back all is good
definitely too much passing in the first half as well we got 3 good backs gotta get them involved
fuck off refs
refball
wtf was that call
cant show the replay because nothing happened
did they start pumping in crowd noise this half
today our kicker became a wr and one of our wrs became a te
gus bus
beep beep its the bus
the gus bus has no brakes
yall werent ready for the bus
so whats going on with dobbins doghouse injury in pregame he had gotten 0 touches
best this century
we finally seem to be getting the running game going
dobbins
holy ray rice deja vu
i see ray rice
theres dobbins
way to get us a first down dobbins
he looks so much like rice
dobbins is special yall
he wasnt even looking at the ball
dobbins using that rice arm
just had a realization about our time of possession on this drive unreal
its nice having ray rice back
this drive has officially taken half the quarter

lets end it right boys
olgeez man
jesus christ line
philips is killing us at rg
no pi
oof that was close
holy shit tucker got me worried
i get we are up but this o line is really sad today
nailed it

x200b

47yd field goal for tucker
man what is up with our o line
tucker playing with us lol
phillips is fucking shit
oline is worse than dogshit
bozeman is our best lineman at the moment stanley a close second and that makes me suuuuper nervous
lamar needs to throw it to the check down it might be a difficult throw but its the only option
cmon defense step up and get the ball back
fuck yes
brought the house and it fell on watson like the wicked witch
bwill getting pressure i see you big boy
bowser has been amazing so far
watson is so good jesus
that was a good throw
averett sucks
what the fuck
we cant do better than averett god damn that mother fucker sucks
oof amazing pressure but averett not quite there
that was a fucking beautiful pass
im so sad about tavon
lol
has hump even allowed a completion
line needs to get better at picking up their assignments

i know yanda is gone but this has been an inexcusable amount of missed blitzers
can watson not set his feet and throw anymore he does that highschool jump pass even when theres no pressure lol
i know we have a 10 pt lead but it just doesnt feel like it bc we can barely stop the pass and the o line cant pass block to save their lives and before you ask no im not a bandwagon fan from last year
we need a touchdown
houstons wr corps is allin on blazing fast 2s lol
get 6 sirs
points or bust on this drive
any news on tavon
if you ignore the fact we are up and only look at the bad plays we are playing god awful s
own td game over
is there a way we can run the clock for 1410
snead
need4snead
good job snead
nice to see the ravens having multiple receivers with decent hands
remember that flacco era game where jj watt basically singlehandedly destroyed us i cant remember the specific year
man jj watt has been an absolute beast today
i really dont care for plays to ricard
go for it
going through his reads

not sure ive ever seen a play blocked that well
thank you thank you thank you

thats what im talking about
another sack
theres the sack
joker
joker szn
there we go deshon
finally starting to feel good about this game pls football god dont jinx us
lets eat some clock
lol kc is not taking that l
boyle gives up on blocks so fast
amazing tackle stopped a touchdown
what a freaking tackle i thought he was gone
jackson had the whole outside and ran straight into the defender
kinda disappointed that we didnt take that to the house lmao
well at least were still terrible when it comes to challenges
yo again i ask where can i get that neck gaiter harbaugh is wearing
good win obv but you gotta feel bad for the wasted talent in houston
fake punt sam koch td pass

ill buy a koch jersey immediately
i feel like stanley not having a good gameis this true
gus bus is sneaky big
i gotta say edwards looks a heck of a lot more explosive than ingram so far this year
gus the bus
i heard gus was once called the bus
damn gus bus is fucking doing it today
gus is going to get paid next year
gus bus jerome bettis
the bus lost its brakes
run up the score on them
you know whats an improvement last season lamar had trouble keeping an eye on the play clock but this year he seems to be in complete control
boze on that play tho
gus is so damn talented i hope we dont trade him
these timeouts yikes
lets see jk run it down their throat
still think gus should be our 1 i love ingram but gus is my man
jk in the doghouse for something what he do
chargers up 3
lets get lamar another passing td
lamar jackson td coming up
running out of bounds lamar hmm
also i was thinking this earlier i dont think jk quite knows the playbook yet and thats why hes not playing as much but im just guessing
props to the texans lbs theyve been keeping up with lamar for the most part
why we extending the game lol run up the middle lol
this was a gutsy win but our blocks were so loweffort
today was a good day to have tucker on your fantasy team
rg3 time
anyone else just get a big ass smile looking at lamar on the sideline
gg guys lets gooo
remember when people in here were just saying how our defensive pressure is awful
dayum
lol we really out here adding insult to injury like this
43 yards from 3rd string rb yes please
glad we came out of this game with a w and mostly healthy
this is tough for houston they havent looked that bad these last two weeks but they seem like they have no heart left two games back in the division already too
oof not gonna be able to physically watch the game next week gonna have to listen on 98 rock dont have espn anymore
lets goooo 20
lol game over
chargerschiefs likely going to ot if the chiefs dont win outright
can we make sad texans a new meme
lol he really called a punt there huh
the crowd noise in this la game is annoying like an annoying constant buzz
our oline is straight trash
if lamar made that pass his haters wouldnt shut up
tavon injured what else is new
we arent playing particularly well today guess im spoilt by our great play in the lamar era
laughably bad play calling here yes our line is bad and will offer no protection so why arent we dialing up a short pass or a draw
dobbins needs to block
another day another tavon on ir
whelp there goes tayvon young
im pretty sure tavon just ended his career i really hope im wrong
holy shit we look like ass today andrews is the only consistent player
lamar is carrying us rn lol goodness
is the field super shitty lamar keeps slipping
i know deshaun is good but you have to get a sack there embarrassing
lmao tucker
tucker is a new wr
put tucker at wr
judon is getting close though someone who told me clowney sucks cause he doesnt get sacks
now our obj is acting like a homegirl
time for fluker at rg
the next texans completetion ravens reddit is going to call for bisciotti to sell the team
amazing how these announcers really forget about the person who got this mobile qb trend started with cam
do not go for it if we dont get it
miles boykin is such a good blocker
best in the league
averett is fucking trash what the fuck was that
tavons just going to be one of those guys isnt he fuck
can we trade for jj watt at halftime
online is having a hard time yes but it seems lamar is picking the wrong of the two holes every single time which is extremely uncommon though no real blame on him considering he usually always picks the right hole
didnt get promoted buy a car

we definitely care about women amirite fellas
well that was flat
comeon rookie you got to make that block
first drive lamar scrambled during a 3 man rush he usually stays patient at that point

2nd down play reminded me of the bills game
come on matt gotta make that play
tavon is made of fucking glass man
every fucking year poor guy
mahomes playing like shit today
mahomes is 28 for 14 yards after 1 quarter i mean theyll almost certainly still win but that is pretty wild
the texans are going to gain some yardage but make no mistake there is absolutely nothing there for them right now anywhere on the field this is some vintage ravens defense so far
tucker
damn first bad pass from lamar
seriously fuck this week
fuck our oline is terrible
extremely lucky to be up by 13 now
temper tantrum
well just make the ref fumble and theyll add time for you
the defense ended the half with a penalty filled choke job think the same thing happened last week but we escaped without giving up anything
ive seen a lot of bs officiating in my life but giving time back to the opposing team so that they have enough time for a fg thats beyond ridiculous
dude was open
shit coverage by queen
why the hell was queen playing at corner
was nervously waiting for a flag there on marlon
i never watch broadcast tv except during football season damn these commercials suck even worse during an election year
imma need mandrews to go off these next 7 minutes to hel my fantasy team
that was so risky
put gus edwards in the ring of honor
props to the oline theyre winning the battle when they know whats coming
theres no reason for lamar to carry let alone go out of bounds there
take 3
run up the score plz
ferguson cant even get off a running back bro
imma be honest dont flame me fellas i think bakers commercials are funny
this play calling is trash
honestly its not spoiled or annoying for wanting to have the team mix up the plays use the running backs we have they can help
mahomes will eat this secondary alive were going to have to blitz 6 the whole game
broncos
please broncos
steelers bout to lose to a back jeff driskel
i really hope this game finishes before our game starts
at least theres no way for this game to go into ot
still not over
will the steelers play against real football teams this year besides us
man this game sucks i cant wait for lamar to put 60 on the steelers fts
broncos choking again
fuck
every time i see a score that shows the underdog making a game interesting literally within two minutes of me turning the game on they fucking tank and do something stupid
had to switch over to the washington game really cant sit through this steelers game until ours starts
ravens game day boys lets go
damn steelers always getting lucky against awful teams
im watching sunday ticket wheres the game
oh yes harlan is commentating im so happy
texans won and elected to receive they know if they give the ball to lamar to start theyve got no chance
all the homies love kevin harlan
we are off

tavon pls
goddammit tavon
thats not ideal
oooph bad landing
fuck

fuck
that did not look good gotta feel for tavon man second year in a row what a terrible day for injuries but not a good way to start
what even happened there
what a surprise
hopefully its just a knee sprain
the falcons are having the hardest 283 flashbacks right now
fuck man was so excited to see him play this year w mp and marlo
id rather see jimmy outside now and marlon in the slot
watson does have good escapability that was nice pursuit
good pressure there and nice play by queen
good defense
good job d
punt
lfg
finally they got him down
not a sack but ill take pressures all day everyday
hope my dude young is good wearing his jersey that i never wear too much and of course
ok shake off the last drive and get some momentum here
i like how weve already touched the qb more than we did last week
come on guys you need to have faith have faith in my bobby
lets fucking do something now
ditched my wife making halloween decorations to watch the game im in trouble but dont care
watt is just good
what the fuck offense
78 you awake
run the ducking ball
ffs we gotta protect lamar
mandrews
mandrews
jj is gonna be disruptive lol
andrews there we go
nice but no need for the hurtle there mandrews
helmet to helmet
handrews do be looking like white drake
those first few offensive plays were an hommage to our prelamar days
gotta love how the texans pa people accidentally made the fake crowd cheer during a big play for the ravens haha
literally zero runs lol
have we ran the ball at all yet
the o line is looking like an issue early
big boy boykin
good play boykin
god the people in this fucking game thread man you would think we would be down 21 by the way people are talking
hell yea myles
offensive line needs to wake up
lets go miles
run the bal
yes boykin nice slant
how bout our runningbacks take some carries
has anyone seen our o line
the oline looks awful whats going on
there he is
now this looks like the ravens offense
is stunting happening
oof that injury report does not sound good
we rollin now boys dont forget the texans are still a good team
is tavon done for the year again that would be devastating for him
they aint running the ball cause our interior line had some trouble against cleveland last week how yall think they will do better against the texans dline who is 10x better than cleveland
ravens cornerback tavon young knee doubtful to return aaronwilsonnfl
damn it need young
lamars doing a good job avoiding injuries so far
oline has been hot shit lamar keeping the drive alive every play
both tackles seem confused
nice route by boykin
lamar such an escape artist
finally seems like the o is getting a rhythm but itd be nice to get the backs involved
what a run
shame lamar got caught there they faked out watt real good
i like the 3 definitely wanna see more running plays to our rbs though cant complain about the drive though d is holding it tf down
both defenses came to play today
tackle and damn watson is strong
damn dude i hate those plays lol
dang is ds greased up
punt
sneaky watson
credit to our secondary for holding it down through that 3rd down
are you serious ward
we have to finish these tackles guys
sack that mf goddamnit
bruh the play clock was on 2 just let it run out
watson is really good at breaking tackles
watson just too strong lol
so this is what other teams feel
fuck yeah
want that face covering harbs has anyone know if its for sale
defense
thank you very much
horrible call by texans
lets gooooooooo
thats embarrassing
aw yiss motherfucking pressure
queeeeeeen
lmaooooo
lfg
get your fucking weak shit outta here
lets get a td here
recepback
oh yeah i like that
ingram took a hell of a shot and didnt even flinch
havent seen a screen in years
goes for it on 4th down in their own territory and doesnt get the first

the connection to your peer has been lost
reminder we were only up by one score at the end of the first quarter of last years texans game then we feasted
wasnt our score something like this after q1 against texans last year
that was a strange move by bob no fans low energy 30 game you just manufactured energy for the ravens man
dunn is a big boy
bozeman block was fire
bob is glad he has a mask on to hide his red ass face rn
i have it on good authority that greg roman read all of your complaints tyfys
yasss screen
boyle just cant buy a td
omg boyle almost
i thought thats was 6 for sure
ill fucking take it
gotta lead him just little more llama lol
we jivin now
im happy to see hayden succeed today but were still good without him
touchdownnnnnnnn
good work patty

ill take it lol
nice job ric
juiceman pick 6 plz
recepback
i say texans you say fuck em texans
whats the rule again for blocking kicks seemed like a lot of texans lined up on one side
anyone from az know why our cbs isnt showing games today its three hours of paid programming in place of the game lol
come on d
pass rush needed desperately
seeing lineman just standing around as a play ends give me war flashbacks to middle school and i love it
fuck
oof marlon abandoned the te was he expecting help
whos man
double awful yuck
smh
fuck
alright get one back
ok

lets go
its really disappointing that ferguson or bowser arent starters at deolb yet we need a serious upgrade in those positions
ibm watson hahahahahaha
need a touchdown drive here

texans are a good team watt is back and were in their house after blowing them out in ours last time
marlon tried to pull a peters and jump the outside route ended up handing fells a first down
levine showing why he stays on special teams still after this whole time
lamar is sharp
duvernay
lamars throws just look so much more crisp this year
duuuuuuuuuu
duv
love devin
beautiful throw
wheres jk
how come our fake hand offs look a lot more fake this season
interesting that were not trusting them deep yet
yeah man its not as easy for us to run to the right without yanda
jk time
lol tuck
i fucking love this team
hollywoood
hollywood
thats an easy 26 yards
hollywood always seems so close to turning those jets on
holly

tucker is automatic
ill take those points thank you very much
i wish we were running as much as we were play actioning
now this might be hard for you all to understand but jk might not be a good matchup against this d line also hell be much fresher later when the d is tired
yess i started dst
i just creamed
just when yall were losing truss
hell yeah lets punch this one in
i think hes in
humphrey the hammer
i liked that
that fucking punch
marlo is that motherfucker
thanks for the ball houston

hell yeah im wearing my humphrey jersey today too
fuck yea

hollywood was gonna let deshaun eat shit into the bench lmao
holy shit mp juicemannnn
what a grab by peters
fucking peters
great catch
that shit was beautiful
what an int
holy shit that pick
what a fucking catch
you love to see it
that was a beautiful catch by peters
peters
that was an incredible dive
mp juice man
i love our secondary
mp juice man
now we gotta game goin
announcer should know it doesnt matter if it touches the ground as long as hes in control of it when it does
fuck he could have been a wr lol
lets fucking go
im just picking up on it
whats up with the lack of deep play attempts is it because of the amount of pressure lamar is under
can we get some fucking protection for lamar please
jimmys turn please
watts still got it dang
f
can we actually protect lamar
watson looks like he wants to end it all lmao
why arent we running the ball
were making the plays but the texans are manhandling some guys out there a lot more physical
fuck
rare bad play
he looks ok
holy shit bad goes to worse
not stanleyagain
please be okay stanley we need you
no reason to call such a play on offense you know our o line cant hang on for more than a few seconds so theres very little chance our wrs can run a longer route need quick hits not long slow developing pass plays come on
stanley doesnt look too distraught
alright defense no points lets go to the half
roman needs to play all to their strengths gun the whole game
wouldnt a pick 6 be fun here
terribly managed drive there that was a chance to really put the texans up against it
such a weird game
anyone got any oline players for a 5th rounder
this new overly pass happy play calling along with our struggling ol is really pissing me off now
oh yeah we can get sacks too baby
shocked that we were actually able to tackle watson there
theres the sack we needed
queen
bowser deserves a contract extension over judon so far
i got excited for a sack but nvvm
judon needs to break down and tackle he keeps diving and wiffing
bs call
queeeeeeeen
averette is bbq chicken
ofc a convenient penalty
can we fucking tackle jesus christ
defense shitting the bed now
home game clock operator is friendly
nice referee escort on this drive
okay ref what are you seeing
whats the noise i hear in the broadcast i thought they werent pumping crowd noise at the stadium
put jimmy on the outside man this is why we signed him
we just rushed 2 wtf
we need to chill tf out
what in tarnation
we adjust and get the ball back next half were still up two scores people
as long as the line play is cleaned up next half we should be fine
6 point swing cause of that sack oh well still in good position
this is defensive battle imo neither of our lines are holding up
chest pain wtf is that lol
not apart of the local market and the cbs game for my area is the chiefs game fuck me i guess

how is the game so far
what is pollards beef
damn that washingtoncardinals game is speeding theyre already 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter
we knew oline would not be the same without yanda
stanley is hurt and looks like it and brown jr is getting embarrassed by watt we need to do something
omg bullshit flag

great job boykin
boykin te
boykin the tight end
wait boykin is a tight end
boykin just chilling where he needed to inbetween
did boykin play te in college
there is a reason they keep calling pass they arent able to get enough push on oline
gus bus
where is dobbins
nice run gus
lets get the bus chugging baby
tha wheels on tha bus go round and round
the gus bus rolls
da busss
love boykin
gus bus lets get that run game going
lamar has been deadly with his voice today
now we running
dobbins might not be a strong blocker yet
keep gus in over mark rn if were just gonna act like jk doesnt exist lol
gus is a beast for bit dls

even if jk is an everydown back i love rotating power and speed backs
i love seeing gus getting physical
jk
that was some terrible blocking lol
jk
jk rolling
dobbins you fucking stallion
i like that dobbins
love that second effort by dobbins
dobbins giving me ray rice flashbacks

get jkd
looked like ray rice
dobbins has received a target from his coach dobbins is a free rb
amazing play by dobbins
dobbins fresh in the second half lets get it
jk had has the hand like ray
orlando brown i love you man but you are getting eaten alive against watt today
fucking oline
ugh oline
obj is getting worked
i want to see an option play with llama dobbins bus ingram and fuck it why not rg3
can our ol block
where is our oline today texans d is not good yet we are getting manhandled
really not liking our oline play
kinda fucked up that you cant challenge a nocall
damn you could see the shadow of the ball on the goal post as it passed hard to get closer than that without hitting still the goat
man i miss yanda his presence made the two guys next to him better and its showing these first two games
dont think phillips was as ready as harbs thought he was skura is playing slightly scared it looks like which is to be expected coming off such a serious injury bozemen has held up decently though
start fluker and start dobbins
lamar ran straight into that sack phillips picked up the stunt pretty well tbh still unsure about him but that one wasnt a miss
come on d make a play we need yall
eww ray look creepy af in that pic lol
13 pt lead not bad
come on defense tighten up
there we go
nice
big baby
that tackle holy cow
nice tackle averette
thank god we sacked him cooks was wide open
sack
yeah both of these olines are trash today
23 powned
what the hell did watson do to piss off his own center this much
jesus christ deshaun is a beast
how
that was a great play god damn
nvm lol
how did that throw arrive
come on man
i thought that one was pi
this ad is worse than the champ is here very 2020
we need to rally back on offense next drive go down field take time off and score a td field goals will win it but we want to win with confidence
stills smiling at humphrey like he even came close to catching it
need a stop here defense needs to show some fire
goddamn it calais
nice hold
we drained 15 minutes of game and kept the margin 10

i consider this an absolute win
noice
this is the way
run the ball convert with mandrews on third get it done letssssss gooooooo
that right there helping up the opponent is what makes lamar jackson an awesome human
willie pinballing through the d
sneeaaaad
slippery as a rain drop
watt is definitely showing up today
im so conflicted these are two great plays but they are moving down the field faster than my fatass when its meal time
i want 2 td passes by lamar
gus is freaking unstoppable
fuck it go for it
damn i wish we had a big physical wr like boldin used to be
omg yes
mark ingram or lamar jackson i cant tell
and this too is the way
boom
ingram
what a play call
lets goooooooo dagger
lets fucking gooooo
god i love mark ingram
no lio boi
fuck yeah
i was questioning not getting 3 there but lol me that was awesome
30 yardz baby biggg truzzzzzz
thats ball game big boi
mark mf ingram
hahaha fuck yes ingram still got it
ingram
yessir
lmaooooooo
drink to that my brothers we can relax now
what a call thank the football gods it worked or it wouldve been a terrible call am i right boys
der d
holy shit one of our lineman got their ass handed to them on that last play
make em work for it d nothing fast
ughhhhhh this what yall dont need
is it me or is ward getting no push on that left side
elliot is the enforcer out there
cmon defense game aint over yet
not sure if texans looking good on offense or our defense not on point
i hate this prevent d were playing
that was actually a really good route by cobb
is tht a humphrey sack
gotcha
deshon szn
im glad were getting to play a game this physical and seemingly close defense needs to fight through the rest of this quarter
lets get that score go ravens
i really enjoyed the ingram td with lamar at wr and a rb at qb
ah here comes the pat mahomes comeback
i need some gus in the 4th quarter

how is mahomes so good
chiefs looking at our game so they gotta come back lol
great stuff that ingram run was chefs kiss
that would have been six if it wasnt for that tackle
is jah reid available
damn mahomes that was a crazy pass
just no reason for designed lamar runs in the fourth quarter up 14
thats a first wtf refs
go for it
saved the touchdown

daaamn
fuckin mark needs to finish that block
send it
seriously
big truss here on this call
i havent been watching but i assume herberts been balling
if it ends up being short i dont think its a good idea to go for it even though weve been very successful in the past
lets go for it coach
challenges make me anxious
ez
was that ball game
wft coming back a little
gus is so fucking good
this dudes got balls the size of texas
kc roughs the passer on a 3rd down play where it was an incomplete pass
wind that clock
is ingram not fit to play
they have hardly played dobbins today
guys the bus
boykin blocking downfield is awesome kid is the unsung hero of this run game
gus bus
gus for mvp
chill edwards i can only get so hard
fuck it lets see a strike into the endzone here brown or andrews
ejection
was that 90s second
did the chargers bench tyrod for herbert
gimmie another lamar td for fantasy purposes would prefer rushing but will settle for passing im not fussy
somebody stay in bounds
buried
chuck
ugh thats kevin harlin hes totally obsessed with me
fuck it play action lamar to hollywood touchdown

s kind of
texans quit on themselves
somehow chargers let mahomes scramble for 21 when they needed 20
good job team
tavon young likely out for season
few bad plays and we trash again gtfo fake ass fans
oline needs to get their shit together man we should be up 27 or 237
guys its one bad drive reeeelax
and tavon might have torn his acl again another sacrifice to this bloody sunday in the nfl
not sure why weve completely abandoned the run ingram and dobbins just not getting any touches on two drives already
trash ass offensive line
blatant fixing by the refs there
rgiii has the best smile
i dont think people realise how good texans d is we cant be super human all the time
i told you guys oline was gonna struggle those of you who downvoted me owe me money
just bench lamar too risky to play him this week everyones going down
pls run the ball
trash first drive
some guys just have awful luck plays in 2nd game since 2018 gets injured again and it doesnt look good
young injured again big fuckin surprise
dude andrews needs to stop jumping
just protect the ball pls lamar
might want to consider shuffling up the oline looks terrible
texans are such a dangerous team glad we took the points there but dang a td wouldve felt great there
we left our tackling at home
thanks bob
not looking great
elliot looks slow there
where are our corners this should be an easy strap up man coverage kind of day by marcus marlo and jimmy
im really starting to hate the fake crowd noise about as much as i do laugh tracks on network sitcoms
lamar cant throw

haters
hot take duv is going to be our next jacoby
nice catch by tucker
nice pass to tuck
put tucker in hell get a td
i feel like the offense is being too cute rn
two possession game after the refs gifting them 3 lmao keep helping them refs they need it
hope our oline shows up for the second half
yall need to settle down lol the world isnt going to explode if we dont score 3 touchdowns per quarter
everyone is blaming the ol for that sack that sack isnt the ols fault
theyre just driving up and down the field smh
this game is far from over especially if they stay uptempo and we play prevent or some nonsense
excellent block by bozeman
go for it
run the fucking score up fuck rg3 lol
i hate when lamar takes knees because it hurts his rushing stats dudes gonna take like 50 knees this year and his ypc average will drop a bunch
why was queen outside guarding 1 on 1 like that
i honestly expected more from us big ups to the texans for making us earn it
greg roman you dumbass you need to run kill clock and hit the field goal but no you wasted the turnover and now stanley is injured

man we could see the makings of a bad oline in the browns game but now its really hurting us against a bad team
im glad the refs can just give free timeouts whenever they want

nfl hates us cause we love our players and support blm
yall always gotta complain about something huh
unpopular opinion but i get a lot of entertainment from some of the content on tiktok ill be sad to see it go
i could care less what they did before the game i dont need a kneeling update every week on what the team did and what anthems they did or did not stand for
ugh 4th down
the interior oline is still weak i see
dammit tavon young just cant stay healthy
he can never stay healthy
tavon and injuries man
well we resigned jimmy smith to a one year prove it kind of veteran deal and he yet again cant make the field


correct me if im wrong but i think averrett is in instead
another year our return game doesnt exist lmao
why sre they trying to kill lamar call a fucking run
the o line has regressed so much what a damn shame
llama gonna run out of energy by the 2nd quarter run the damn ball
ready for dubs for both my ravens and lakers today
im sad i have to miss the cards and chiefs game because im focusing on ours but at the same time we the best so am i really missing out
i dont hate mahomes i really like him but i do hope he lays an egg in his game because why on earth is this not the national game
tucker with the godly catch
marlon punchfree
this is why you run the ball to freeze their ends and give yourself 3rd and shorts the play calling hasnt been good this game has been all our defence our only td came on a 30 yard field the offence needs to establish the run idk why we keep passing on 1st and have given dobbins 0 carries last time we abandoned the run like this was the playoff game
there are going to be problems if they bring this play to pittsburgh
we dont need yanda its week 2 chill
refs trying to bail out the texans and make this a game
weve played very sloppy and still are up 207 we need to wake up now
learn to wear a mask you fucking ancient zebra cunt
any way we can realistically improve our pass rush this season like who we can trade for or something
not sure how you make that play with him shoving you like that blatant pi
you guys are new to lamar jackson if you think this o line punishment is new to him all that chaos is way too familiar to him
averett with a good play
if young is out for a while we really should trade to get someone other than everrett
cant have those mistakes right now make a play d
awful throw
not good for lamar stay inbounds
man do we have the best 123 rb lineup in the league or what
the gus buss gas mileagebattery range just went up
the bus is just working them right now
gus buschoo choo motherfuckers
where was andrews all game wtf
is stanley still out yall oline aint holding it down like normal
yooo why is lamar not bailing out
this shit is fucking rigged ffs
texans are just one good drive from making this a onescore game
time for some texan bbq
lets gooooooooooooo

the knees are compromised today
averett is ok
good stop
get ready to watch averett get burned
queen is a king
great stop defense pray for tavon
queeeeen
long live the queen
monstars
hope young is ok
lets go o
whats the most important piece on a chessboard
profootballdoc thinks its an acl injury for tavon
lamar scores 2 td in 6 minutes
are we not allowed to run today
ouch
were getting close to blocking these punts
bad start for the offense
ugh we need ronnie stanley
not pounding the rock the hell
nowhere to go on that play
ugh
one first down lets go
fuck yes
lovely block
mandrews
man loves to hurdle
lamar is my dad andrews is my papa
best te in the league
i fucking love mark andrews
there we go
anybody got a working stream
nice block by boykin
fucking mandrews
lmao yall have lil truzz
i dont get the play calling thus far
boykin with a man sized block
bless you mandrews
thats more fucking like it
wtg mandrews now lets run
run the ball
run the ball harbs
is ingrim hurt
did the rbs suit up today
how was that roby hit on hollywood not a flag for leading with the crown
andrews really need to watch the hurdling hes going to get hurt
mandrews hurdling brings back bad memories
mama there goes that mandrews
run dammit
i love boykins block there how come we havent ran the ball a single time except for the sweep running backs
uh run the ball bb
oline looks baaaaaad so far
roman you are really confusing me here
wow what a throw also olinehow about a second or two
did not like that landing from mandrews me no like helmet hitting ground hard
isnt lonnie johnson the guy who misspelled his name on his sat
mandrews nice block by boykin too
are we just passing vs afc south teams or what
beautiful run by lamar there
lamar nice
finally a decent run
cool cool i think they just needed a series to remember that not every team is the the browns
boykin has much improved
fuck youngs done for the day probably
ravens marching
yes slants to big body receiver finally
fuuuuck poor tavon
t young knee problemno dah
well crap young likely done for the day
fuck we need tavon
classic lamar right there love it
gus almost plowed through that tackle
tavon young best nickel cb in the league for 1 game you get out of him a year
llama is showing off
yes but slide feet first lamar
omg lamar is so fucking good
hold my breath every time he goes face first
a cleanse of pallet after watching my man burrow try to be lamar lol
lamar is good
love gus even on 3 yard runs
good drive by the offense the defense is getting some good rest with this drive
3 in a row
no one went to pick up lamar
lamar fast
any decent slot corners available losing tavons a big blow to our depth
broken ankles
cunningham is pretty good it seems
i miss yanda
hollywood wants nothin to do with watt lol
go for it
itwt
we dont seem to be using the fake handoff look that we used a lot last year
a lot of new fans were not here when every game was within 3 and came down to the last play i see lmaoooo
houston would have 7 on the board of we had just picked baker up in the draft shit
its early in the season they are showing some looks for upcoming teams to study
defense make a play
everybody dont care anything else but please stay healthy until the chiefs game
how is lamar so young
run d looks good
but yeah let jkingram run a little
stuff these fuckers get um off the field
least we forced the 4th no 1st down but jeeeeeeezz we need better rush
i know tackling deshaun isnt easy but that was awful
really suprised that wasnt blown dead
when did the texans pick up russell wilson
shit i was so stress lucky he got out so many tackles he shouldve thrown it away like 20 times that play
fucking make the tackle
yes
hell yeah
defense
lol watson had no chance
big oof
bill obrien wow
who had the qb pressure
trust bob to make a horrible decision
lets go boys
unrelated but where can i get that neck gaiter that harbaughs wearing
im gonna need two tds to hollywood for my fantasy team
i know nobody cares about fantasy but i just traded watkins for hollywood minutes before kick off im stoked
bob is gonna bob

why did the texans decide not to pump crowd noise
wide open
too much time
whew
just like that
false start
damn
fells eating our lunch
burn the clock and get the ball back next half and double up on scores
those passes to the te who is so much bigger than our dbsreally hard to stop even with perfect coverage dunno what you are even supposed to do there
pls respond rn offense were fortunate that bob is an idiot
stream
offsides
damn first flag clean game
lets get it
duveryay
jacksons ability to turn an aggressive blitz against them is just fun to watch
yes need more ingram
we got this
move those chains move those chains move those chains huaa
oh boy
tuck with the catch goat
that was harder than it needed to be
lamar and the receivers are playing great
lot of open receivers down the field
man he juuuuuust barely got hollywood
damn
fuck
awww
tucker is so damn good
that show actually looks good to me
great special teams play by board
where the hell is jk dobbins today
this is a good game to get out if sync texans are really good and if we can grind this out it might show some of our coaches and players our deficiencies before the game vs chiefs
and just like that we run away with it
lets fucking go defense
and thats how you get back d
fucking cowards give my man his pick 6
fumble td lets fucking go
long texans drive here for a td to end the half would be bad lets get hype for the first time this game defense
just thought to myself we could use a fumble

fruit punch is in season

please let this stand
falcon punch
you love to see it
marloooo lets gooo
hey thats a touchdown
lets gooo
our defence just played right
he aint even step out
marvin for defensive mvp

he made a football move after catch the ball its a fumble
marlon is gonna get his bread soon

herbert winning against mahomes lamar best qb mvp
fuuuck yes

lfg
lets fucking goo
watson slightly overrated hmmm
end it here
no one even close to open
guys when did ed reed come back wearing 24
watt is just fucking terrorizing is god damn
got damn o line
jj owns our line when we play in nrg
brown kinda stopped onn watt a little early
need to get obj some boyle help
brown gotta move his feet there
fg target line is that corrected for tucker
lets get enough for at least a fg
i like a td here but if we only get 5 yards and a fg im happy
its jj watt dude is a fucking beast not surprised
oh god
i mean shit o line
man o line is getting torched
fuck
can we not
dont ruin our chance to see tucker kick a really long fg its not fair jj
whats with all the pass plays
damn why yanda
god damnit
dobbins missed that block
bro our oline nooo
fuck
he looks fine
ronnie pls be okay

we love you ya big bear
not that the online has been stellar but that was an all out blitz
ronnie stanleys ankle again
no points for them cmon stop them here
offense hasnt felt as dominant on the texans side of the field as id like to see
all these people crying about these sacks but lamar aint drop the ball most qbs would have dropped that ball
these tes are killing us
finally a sack
looks like the texans woke up
cmon defense
obviously im not a coach but if theyre rushing the linebackers and we have very fast wr why dont we run them down the middle
i hope stanley is okay

instead of clock running out now it stops
dammit
averrett is trash i dont want anyone to convince me otherwise
int calling it by clark
averett is a fast frank walker
okay didnt see the ref kick it ill allow it
thats fucking crazy
still blame the lack of a rush
bull shit
skura is just a shadow of his former self absurd to play him in the condition he is in
just saw a local political commercial that was literally this but with wrestling techniques instead of guns so so dumb
collusion
great protection there
wow the line held up lol
lamar had time he needs more
cunningham is everywhere
roman run the damn ball
hey guys a run
gus the bus
he really do be looking like a bus sometimes
ok as much as ive been loving seeing jacksons upgraded passing abilities its nice to see some running too
this is why we should be running
honk honk
the bus is rolling
gus running mfs over
the gus bus stops for no one
if there werent other guys around gus would have 100 broken that tackle on his previous run
ingram might not be as fast as he used to but he still runs hard
played wr at notre dame
always forget how explosive gus is
gus should get ever 2 yards to gain even time
look at that stat fuckin beautiful

these ravens are something special
lamar doing work with the snap count
ill take that
hollywood deep
lamar tapping into that bradyrodgers energy get those free yards make them think twice about jumping the snap count
gus doesnt get enough recognition man
x200b

lamar making espn highlight reels
are you all happy you got your planned run with lamar now
jk is in
keep him in you fucks
good job dobbins
i love that from jk
damn i cant believe he stayed up for that
fucking right dobbins

thats some rice shit right there
sick tackle break jk
atta boy dobs
nice fucking play dobbins
way to stay on your feet jk
nice job
dobbins making plays

jk out here turning cbs into fools
jk lol
what a catch and run
is something wrong with ingram
jk but we aint joking
exactly what im talking about no way we let gus go with jk perfect 12 punch
reminded me of another 27 with that
when our run game is working we are almost unstoppable
that was a money throw

need a td to hollywood here
dobbins is so fucking good
mckinney turned pretty freaking late on that one
jesus fucking christ online is total shit today
gimme 3
smhhh

snead
perfect qbs draw and quick slant to snead thats how to slow down the rush

come on defense dont do that
marlon humphrey a slot cb
jesus another obvious missed hold
apparently sammy watkins suffered a possible concussion in todays game
can we keep playing aggressive a lot of time left
i would not wanna be watson there and have campbell fall on you
bowser in coverage
another sack whiffed
how did whoever that was miss that sack
that block by project pat on the ingram td amazing
id like to see the oline and the rbs get some realtime chemistry going for the rest of this game were going to wantneed it at some point
justin reid is very good
damn that was a clutch stop on lamar ngl
go for it
surrender index is gonna flame us hard if we punt
anybody know if the neck gaiter harbs has is avail for purchase cant find it on any of the main sites nfl shop fanatics fansedge

also solid overall game go ravens
look like llama said ill do it myself lmao
not worth it thats how mahomes got hurt
the cardboard fans are kinda creepy
i wonder why lamar doesnt have audibles like mahomes does yknow how mahomes says 35 to signify snap it on 2 lmao
i want us to score 7 more i dont want to see us let up lets make a statement that even on our off days were better than most afc teams
lets make it 37
gus
score again
one more score and put this thing to bed
can we just start with the gus bus from now on like let the man ram that dline a bit then swap in ingram dobbins to get loose on em then let gus carry the team home
wildcat dobby
did he hit lamar late
its not an officials timeoutthey were waiting until the ejected player left the bench area before resuming play
uhhh okay
buh bye bud
lamae ts plz
o line got it done on this drive
lamar td plz
well now it is time for kc it is on big time
go ahead with your bad self chuck clark
david johnson singlehandedly stripped the sack daddy monicker
gg
someone said 90 was stomping lamars head is that true because wth
best back drafted this year
did we play gus so much as cover for the chiefs
dam we make it look to easy
now i just want them to put in justice hill to get his pounding in against the texans
ww
how do ot rules work again
bowser is looking look so far hes been very active in these first 2 games always seems to be around the ball maybe 7 sacks this seasonalso boykin on offense but lj has so much weapons
tavon mr glass young smdh
that wasnt great lets just hope it was a rusty start
man im hoping its rust but our oline hasnt been good squeelers will eat this line alive
this is a closer game than it should be weird play calls and a shaky o line really not making me feel good

i fucking hope nobody falls injured here
damn
that series was uninspired lol
it didnt look like anything even touched him
tayvon young hurt again wouldnt be surprised
roman calling this game way too cute run the god damn ball on first down
roman passing too much just like in the titans game
boykin is such a good ass blocker
sometimes i forget how spoiled we are with lamar
lamar needs to start sliding feet first
need stream plz my power went out no direct tv for me
boyles block game needs help
that wasnt holding ok
yea ive lost hope for this offensive line
oline doesnt look good

why make the texans do anything why not give them 3 points and call it halftime
rushing is not working at all which sucks
boykin the tightend
play calling is horrendous
i really want to see fluker just to see if he can make a difference he looked good last week
fuck with out those turnovers our defense really isnt that good so many wide open targets no pass rush cant finish tackles in the back field letting deshaun finish plays things that will not pass against playoff teams
has there been an update on tavon
lol houston fucking sucks so mad theres a 7 seed now they may make the playoffs
you cant park that bus
great block from boykin
oh yeah boy lets get that run game working
were getting lucky with the turnovers tbh this defense is suspect
little off today texans d not quite that good
throw short on 3rd flacco is that you
were also up 13 points so yeah while the oline play is frustrating i really doubt we lose this game
im very nervous for this game our pass rush is god awful and watson is a magician i also think our run defense is lackluster im nervous for every game though well probably win by 3 scores lmao
fucking hell tavon young mr glass needs to be cut he doesnt do anything for us besides leave us hanging
why the fuck cant our defense play defense right
this is probably the least hype ive been for a ravens game in a while lol
can someone pxp
clearly lamar took notes from kyler murray the goat of getting out of bounds rnfl had some great advice
obj getting used and abused by watt
defense looks shaky
havent caught the game today but from what ive seen a bit it seems lamar is a bit off and so is the line
the fact that it takes 50 people to tackle 1 person is concerning otherwise good d xd
cant believe were winning a home game 3016 in the 4th quarter and these dorky ass doofus in the booth spent more time talking about other teams qbs
sorry ass pass rush
does anyone else think watt is a huge douche
never was a fan of t young dude is too small for a cb
watson sucksbig money for medicore play
do we want the chiefs coming in after a loss i cant imagine them 12
are we going to see rgiii
idk what game yall are watching oline looked much better that drive held the pocket for lamar on most throws and had good run block the only bad play was the sack and they blitzed

so many casual fans
gonna be honest lamar has made the ol look worse on a number of plays this is looking like the steelers game hes seeing ghost rushers
our defense
i hope they dont try to draw a pentaly

you could pull that shit with cleveland but this defense is way too disciplined to do that
where to watch
lamar carrying rn
bwhahahahaha
been watching redzone during commercials and all i can say is andy reid must really hate how he looks in a mask to go with the shield again
where was marlon going lol he just got up and ran the other way
offense looks sluggish today
jj watt make the executive decision to start juicing again
man the pocket was good there lamar ran into a sack
so sad that there is no ravens football next sunday
smh
why are we not running
fade me
cant take a sack there ngl i was thinking hand it off and try a long fg lost 3 points
anyone else just watch peters get fucked up lmao
wow we give our running backs the ball and it works who woulda thought
lol go for it s
shit gotta punt imo
lol random challenge
why the fuck is bob calling timeout
beep beep busssss
gus bus
feed the bus
wheels on the bus going round and round right now
the bus
pat is such a boss
these refs are so fucking incompetent
is it sexist if i say melanie collins is hot
if we lose stanley next week is a done deal loss
lamar is panicking in the pocket we need the o line to step up to calm lamar
too much lamar running
what is lamar doing do you see the blitz get out of the pocket dude
can you guys not start blaming the refs that was an obvious penalty on averett he sucks
shades of romans playcalling against tennessee
tavon younggoing to be a meniscus or acl
who is this play by play announcer pretty annoying
there is no way they were snapping that ball waste of a timeout
we should have at least tried the hard count before throwing the challenge flag
thats shameful how did they possibly not get watson
is it me or has calais just not looked like his pro bowl season last year
how are we beating kc next week
these dumbass mistakes are going to doom us
all the hype just for 2 3 outs by both teams
aww go for it
honest question
how can we afford to pay stanley 22mil when the other 3 or 4 positions on our line are so bad against good pass rushes
wouldnt it make more sense to trade stabley draft a o line piece and pay someone who commands less 1215
jackson needs to do a better job of handing the ball off on the read option
is this an unpopular opinion i dont really think proche is that great as a returner
imagine being lamar jackson and instead of scrambling you collapse in the pocket smfh

edit thanks for the downvotes but yall know im right
stanley hurt now dude is so weak
what team is going to trade us for a corner this year cause me thinks we need one
terrible kick he almost missed
alright that state farm commercial was pretty good lol

were going to get lamar hurt we need to stop doing designed runs for him when its not necessary and he also needs to slide
going to lose

removed
feels like as with what happened in baseball the lack of a preseason is causing more injuries


pas vegan mais content de voir que je suis pas le seul qubecois ici
vegetarian here currently enjoying some morningstar farms buffalo wings lol
meat lover here coming in peace
so what gives it a crab like flavor
im not a vegetarian but i love vegetarian food
why
man that guy was awesome i was so hurt when i heard he was off to the niners ive been a huge ricard fan as soon as they started having him line up in the backfield
only one thing

ricard is better
it throws me back to vonta leach
love me a nastyass fullback like a caterpillar d9 with an attitude and shoulder pads
juice looked very good because checkdown joe threw him the ball a billion times a game still very good but i dont think hed touch the ball nearly as much in this offense

fort has provided positives for us in that pick up starting from his first game edc and then coaching staff have taken full advantage of his hard work
removed
what a fucking interception
i am reeling
that int was a thing of beauty
highlights are already up on youtube 432
removed
damn shame we didnt capitalize on it though
that is some ed stuff right there

dont forget commercial star
once the jackson to tucker connection is mastered the league better watch out
hes also a pretty decent tackler when he needs to
just when the league thought they would catch up on our offense we sneak peak in a new clutch wr gameplan that bitches

lets not forget he also had a mean tackle in preseason a few years ago iirc the man is a swiss army knife
i wish hed run down the sideline and pretended he scored a td then spiked the ball
removed
goodluck he will just take his all pro self and go to another team
stanley is one of the best offensive linemen in the game and is only dealing with a nagging ankle injury the past few weeks pump the brakes
removed
i couldnt agree more levine is too slow averett gonna get exposed
averett made me want to waterboard myself
if your playing the chiefs that showed up today chiefs have zero chance beating you

we are playing a decent team up by 13 every game cant be a blowout homie
texans are a good team
were not the kd golden state warriors bro
were up by 13 and have won 13 straight regular season games everything is more than fine right now

we cant dominate every week this isnt madden
our oline looks crappy but the chiefs oline looks worse right now
our offense line wasnt good last week either and now the cracks are showing more and more we dont have the line we need to win it all currently
removed
respect the instant ask lol
came here just for this
i need it
i cant think of a better celebration in recent memory the fact that he came up a bit short on the spin kick made it so much better
following
someone just posted sort by new
its on the ravens twitter
marky mark

no one knows what it means but its provocative
its like truss but big real big
its a way of life
big truzz is love big truzz is life
its like big chungus no one has a clue what it means but they love it

so were throwing spinning shit now
id love to see the whole run from this angle
strike first strike hard no mercy cobra kai
i said it in the other thread someone please superimpose the steelers logo
he looks like a power ranger lol
that net is dangerous
loved this play call
thats a spinning rear leg side kick
nobody giving respect to the double punch
removed
cant wait for decosta to snag some great ol for a 9th round pick thats where the team needs it the most thankfully lamar has been so calm in the pocket
were like the antipackers in that regard lmao


bob trading his 1 target is still baffling
i sorta feel sorry for watson hes so legit and is with a coachgm that is gonna waste his youth
i like watson hes got great pocket presence and can extend plays

bob is just a dipshit ruining his and jj watts careers
i feel so bad for him
ive loved deshaun since he was at clemson and he deserves so much better than hes been given in houston bob is ontrack to waste a onceinageneration qbs career just like indy did with luck and its a fucking tragedy
that trade of deandre hopkins was epic stupidity
he looked so dejected that entire game
his talent is being wasted he deserves better than what hes getting
i feel bad for him i can never talk bad about him
he shouldve never resigned with texans they are gonna waste his career
thats life in the nfl somebody is going to lose
im rooting for him fr
the game thread was so shocked over how evasive he was i hold my breath every drop back i really dont get why people think hes overrated
my mom laughed louder each time they showed him frozen in rage and said it needed to be a meme
i wouldnt have signed the extension if i was him even if he outlasts bob chances are the next hc wont be significantly better and the organisation will continue to mismanage the pesonnel around him
the rules are simple

submit a playercoachposition group preferably in bold to stand out easier add statsreasoning if you want

make sure your nominee has not already been submitted

previous weeks

week 1 lamar jackson

this weeks nominees are
marlon humphrey

right hook from marlon swung the momentum completely and the texans never recovered
marcus peters marlon humphrey lj fort and patrick queen
the runningbacks

ingram with the swifty 4th down td

edwards with a bunch of backbreaking runs

dobbins with the nice 44 yard run to get us over 200 again
justin tucker

he didnt need to score a game winner but we havent given him the opportunity to often thankfully

his consistency is easy to overlook and take for granted but he kept the distance which is crucial as we play best with a lead so even when the offense couldnt get it done he got us some guaranteed points
tucker for always being reliable
gus edwards that drive was the backbreaker

dont get me wrong defence made plays like crazy but it was that drive where i wrote game over in my notebook
marlon humphrey

led the team in tackles 6 solo 1 assist and the clutch forced fumble
lamar jackson

im 100 percent convinced he makes this offensive line look decent if its any other qb we would have given up 10 sacks put fluker out there at rg and help orlando that right side was abused today
overall gus but forts play really turned the tide in our favour and he flashed in other plays as well
lamar dude kept so many offensive drives alive especially in the first half his stats are good but he played so much better than they say
defense other than anthony averett
decosta for gems signings like fort
mp juice man
the bus that couldnt slow down
so many people here are posting about the running backs but how about my boy patrick ricard blocking for all of them and opening up some massive holes to run through not to mention his layout goalline grab for the td
the gus bus making no stops and taking no prisoners since 2018
team
defense
defense
all running backs
defense made plays when it mattered and held our lead
while we had a good game and good players the oline got pummeled today albeit some of those were because of lamar running around but still gotta hold them boys back
everyone for sure lamar being lamar all the running backs putting in work mp and humph being great tucker not missing as usual not much to criticise other than you know who
another team win

humphrey killed it lamar did great ingram had an excellent run td jk with a game killing run gus controlling the clock fort picking up the fumble juiceman with the int elliott stoping that 4th down and a sack

everyone played well and still we got stuff we know to work on
secondary not named anthony averett

marlon and peters played lockdown coverage all game and each came up with a backbreaking turnover elliott had his first sack chuck kept everyone in position and jimmy played well in his limited role
lj fort looked like a rb on that pylon extension that defensive td is what first allowed us to pull away and we didnt look back
defense

whole squad effort

pq looking like royalty marlon swinging harder than myles garrett lj fort taking it to the house mp juiceman out there pickin like its apple season

i thought some of lamars throws were a bit shaky today and ol was slacking but thats why this is a team our receivers made plays defense stepped it up and as always tucker gets it in

lamar wasnt bad by any means and did a fantastic job dealing with the pressure of an incredible texans d i meant moreso some of his passes were just on the edge and required good moves from our receivers the ricard td that was a bit low comes to mind at this point our competition is only ourselves and perfection is the standard we go by
peters
defensedoes that count
marcus peters
offense gus
defense fort
greg roman gut punch with ingram wildcat completely demoralized the texans they were shell shocked after that
lamar and the run game

that ol in particular the right side did them no favors lamar was super fucking comfortable under pressure like usual and was on point even though he couldnt go deep like he wanted gus mark and jk albeit late but man that fucking run was electric were on fire
fort has fumble recoveries in back to back weeks and this one he turned on the jets let the big man get this one
running backs
gus edwards
defense

lots of good plays and turnovers from them took a while to get some sacks but they eventually came through
running backs
going defense on this one creating turnovers and getting pressure on watson
rbs
gus edwards
peters
marcus peters

that was a great interception you could give it to a bunch of guys as its a true team effort this time but im fine with spotlighting peters
im going to say boykin he didnt have the best game statistically but his presence was felt on the field at times he was invisible last year as a pass catcher run blocks well
ingram for the roundhouse kick and fooling a lot of us thinking that lamar got slow somehow
i cant pick just one so im going withour pro bowl cb duo

marlon humphrey marcus peters

i dont think marlon allowed a single completion and both contributed to turnovers plus the peters int was thing of beauty
lj needs some credit

of course its a team win but fort did a total tempo shift with the scoop and score

humphrey lamar the game plan jk they all work they always work

forts instincts and good angles and pure footballin got the game going the right direction

lfing j fort
the entire defense
marlon humphrey

the punch played great coverage all game and was bringing the energy the way he attacked the lead blocks on one of the plays had me hyped
marlon humphrey and patrick queen
marlon humphreymp juice man
one half of the best cornerback duo

marlon fruit punch humphrey
i vote for the secondary they did a great job slowing down houstons wr core and allowed our front 7 to go to work marlon had the big forced fumble peters that ed reed like interception and elliot with that sack
gus edwards marlon humphrey marcus peters lj fort lamar jackson and calais campbell are the players of the game candidates and the emmy goes to

lj fort
for me it would be the cornerbacks and tucker obviously
marlon humphrey forced a fumble that led to the gamebreaking td and made fuller nonexistent
wink martindale for the second year in a row he had the perfect game plan to stop deshaun watson coverage was excellent and he devised a good blend of blitzes so watson had no time to throw
marcus peters channeling ed reed on that pick

233 i think before the kneel downs so i think we ended up with 230 total
as far as i know he is an impending free agent after the season

i feel that we have to retain this guy hes fit in well with the scheme and lamar just wanted your thoughts on retaining him for next season
honestly hes amazing but rb is the one position where we can lose a guy due to our depth ingram jk and hill are an amazing trio if gus leaves just depends on how much money he wants
give me gus over hill

havent really been impressed with hill
yeah hes worth more to us than he is in a trade next year itll be jk and gus 1 and 2 cut ingram to save cap space but maybe hell resignrestructure on a cheaper team friendly deal

hes a rfa next year
gus probably gets a deal on some other team we dont have the cap to go for him we probably pick up a rb day 2 or 3 if not another udfa it is sad but with c ap dropping so much and the paydays we have to make he doesnt fit in the books
ill say gus is a killer late in a game with the fresh legs we provide him
honestly for the future ill take gus over ingram cause mark us getting old
i really think edc would be amiss to not resign him hes a great 1b 2 back and his 1 cut power style really fits us on 3rd and short

hes got great vision between the guards and fights for yards


id really like to resign him to a deal similar to kareem hunts you then match him with jks contract
gus is a rfa prolly pull 35millyr in free agency

ingram is gonna cost 633 next year can save 5 mill with cut but can prolly pay him whatever we would have to pay gus to keep him

justice is gonna be cheap still

probably trade gus to the jets to replace bell extend ingram keep hill and dobbins
i saw ingram shaking his head and talking to someone on the sideline on his last run its pretty clear mark thought he shoulda scored but it seems like gus is more worried about contact or just doesnt have the elusive necessary no one may have notice but mark points to his head and you can tell its regarding gus not being a very innovative or creative back

i might be an idiot here but isnt it 22 wins

i thought he was 71 rookie year 132 last year and now 20 this year
lamar 2020 make america truzz again build back better baltimore
10 terms please
holy shit this picture
in god we truzz
presiden ollama
i would vote for him for actual president over the two morons currently going for it
we should definitely lose one of our next 7 games so we dont go 283 heard those are cursed numbers

s
this is gold
make america belee again
2 playoff games and 142 last year 4 losses still amazing
youre forgetting two games
oh president my president
my mom thought this was real lol
hes lost to as many teams in 25 regular season games kccle as he has in 2 playoff games sdten

as bad as this sucks for him we gotta restructure that contract paying him lots to never play a full season
3 missed full seasons now
really feel for the guy hopefully averett can step up because he was getting dotted up all game
the best ability is availability
well he only has season ending injuries so i didnt expect anything less
dude needs to retire
tavon is a great player but at a certain point out for the season just becomes who you are 3 of these now idk how much hes got left
are you fucking kidding me thats just shy of 2 full seasons missed in two seasons
man tavon is such a baller cb he plays way bigger than his size and was an incredible find i wish he would get rid of whatever luck is plaguing him
so can we go get carr back from the cowboys practice squad i dont want to see averett on the field trying to stop any of the chiefs receivers next week
time to restructure that contract
come ongod dammit
what else is new
this sucks
really unfortunate for him
fuck this
what team is tanking so we can pry their slot corner away for a 5th
i feel fucking terrible for him cant even imagine what hes going through
im not sure he should be cut next year right off the bat but at this point weve got to plan as if hes not in the depth chart
bro hes good but he gets hurt so much hes missed over 30 games now he should retire
dude cant catch a break next man up
hate to say it but he cant be relied on he shouldnt be on the roster at the start of next season
fuckkkk this one hurts
it certainly seems destined that tavon young deshon elliott are not supposed to play together whenever one is healthy the other one is injured ever since tavons contract extension he has played a grand total of one full game that signing sure looks like one of decostas worst decisions as gm right up there with the et3 debacle

it is a shame because he is a pretty special player when available however it feels as if he has been injured more than jimmy smith lardarius webb combined im exaggerating of course yet another reminder why brandon carr should have never been let go too bad they had to learn this inevitable predictable lesson the hardest way possible
on february 21 2019 young signed a threeyear 258 million contract extension with the ravens making him the highestpaid nickelback in the nfl


cant predict injuries but this hurts
really sucks but hes gotta get cut next yr he was one of my favorites on d too
yep i knew hed get hurt he gets hurt every year
should have resigned carr cb getting super thin
this is probably the end sucks so bad really liked the dude
couldnt watch the game live howd it happen
anyone know how much wed save wasnt his contract right up there at the time i feel for the guy but with zero production we need that money for stanleyhumphreyandrews etc
5th round pick for the jets best cornerbackincoming
well that sucks and with the cap being extremely tight next year i can definitely see him being on the chopping block

its a shame but i think hes going to end up being one of the great what ifs in team history
they gotta cut him at this point its every single year
cut him forever who cares how good he is if he is injured for 50 of his career
there absolutely cannot be any other franchise that has ever been more ravaged by constant injuries to secondary members than what our favorite team has gone through for approximately a decadeplus but hey who cares about a guy that never missed a game in his career just let him leave i pine for brandon carr over anthony averett but those pipe dreams are long gone
bye

holy shit your unread emails give me heartburn
how do you do this on i phone
wait how do you do this
can i get that picture from the widget

lynn is a coward
id rather play the chiefs coming off a close win than a close loss to a rival

how do you get that effort from your team and just hand the chiefs the ball stopped on 4th and 1 or punted to the chiefs 1 yardline you lost the game so dont take it out of your players hands
you cant give them the ball back plain and simple conservative football loses against the chiefs offense
talking about this guy like hes 1 of a kind
thats exactly what i was thinking
yeah i usually love romo but that was just a stupid statement from him
wish you wouldve posted the context no idea what youre talking about
as much a i love to hear the goat getting respect butker is literally the next one in line for career after him so one of a kind no but not many as good as him tucker just happens to be better
the main issue is that the ravens dont have to settle for those king attempts very often meaning tucker cant show case his skills as often
they all want tuckers spot but they cant have it
the chiefs sub really believes his comments to like no one could ever hit a 58 yard fg lmao
im fine with that let them forget tucker is the ravens best kept secret in the nfl
i mean hes paid to talk about the teams and players hes there commenting for
whats the big deal let em enjoy their winthey didnt disrespect tuck
i think we are taking this too personally

is the nfl converter bot still around the website is cancer on mobile

got a feeling we will be seeing the back of averetts jersey a lot next week
the turf monster got him it almost got jk on that 40 yard run as well
why did we believe he wasnt made of glass when history clearly shows this guy is made of glass

goddammit
fool me three times fuck the peace sign
guys career has to be done he didnt do anything abnormal to injure it he just jumped and landed normal
ugh

the play he was injured i couldnt even tell what happened to him he is just made of glass

trade for a db sign a free agent or bring a guy up from practice squad give me your thoughts
if we base it off history well probably trade our washing machine for jaire alexander
sign lamar jackson right now
jimmy will go to cb and well likely promote from within at reserve safety levine will play a lot more in dime packages
i mean he was out all of last season too no
once carr goes back down to ps i think he was pulled up against this week i say we sign him on monday and bench averett
we play football

i mean young was out all of 2019 and 2017 we played the chiefs last year with carr averett and canady and lost on a 3rd down conversion

i think we will be fine
maybe josh nurse who was having a pretty good offseason could be promoted within and play nickel
trade a 5th round pick for strap harris
my guess would be jimmy to outside corner marlon to slot corner geno stone or nigel warrior getting more reps at safety

i saw the username before i opened the thread and i was like oh hell no no you didnt

id say trade for him but the dudes injury cursed
jj is a monster when healthy
i really like jj pure drive and talent while staying humble
jj honestly feasted against our o line they need to do something about the right side put dj fluker in at rg to see if hes any better for now
watt was a fucking menace against us
whispers win it all im rooting for you
i love jj watt and as a firefighter myself seeing him do the fire training is always a great watch
jj was their best player yesterday he was all over us
two humble classy guys sharing a hug stop staring perverts
sounds like yet another season ending injury early in the season thats 3 out of 5 seasons

sucks man just hate it for him
this is unpopular but he needs to be gone yeah hes good really good i like him but hes never available 35 years with season enders is too much and we cant afford to pay him for that
he needs to go man hes eating up too much cap space to be constantly injured
we better be paying everett in peanuts and bubble gum because hes doodoo
even worse is he wont get a good second contract


udrdilatory unsportsmanlike conduct automatic snf win
for context i voiced my opinion on a flag in the ne sea game that i disagreed with and the man comes at all of us like the dirty patriots fan he is oh well shows the class that new enlganders have


facebook

hes talking about the super bowl champion reigning coach of the year right literally the only former raven that has ever had this much of an issue with the organizationharbs dude needs to stfu and realize maybe he was the problem
pollard arguing with randos on twitter shows just how dumb he is and how big of a mistake it was to have him on an nfl team
he said he was kidding after torrey is too nice
pollard had too many helmet to helmet hits
for some reason i thought it was bernard pierce but yeah pollard is a dumbass
honestly its really weird that he still actively shit talks harbaugh this long after his career has ended

dude has been balling these last 2 weeks yet gets no love keep doing your thing 58
he gets no love he gets lots of positive praise
theres literally an lj fort appreciation thread on the front page you loon
pretty sure every raven knows lj fort i think i have even been able to forget he was a steeler
cant believe we got him for free via the eagles lmfao
he definitely gets noticed hes a great veteran presence and off ball lb to compliment queen and harrison
congratulations again on being 20 love you all and happy we could join you in that category
i have aaron and aaron on my fantasy team and theyre making me look like a genius
it was looking dicey for you all early but not surprised at all that the packers were able to pull away once the lions became the lions again
happy cake day
aaron jones is a monster
jesus yall have a scary team rn see you in february
thanks buddy

aww man its devastating for the kid all the talent in the world and the body just cant hold out i cant imagine the frustration cut him a break
no need for this imho the guy has played well and hard for us and rehabbed from multiple injuries

not his fault that hes hard luck

sometimes im embarrassed by my fellow fans
bro delete this
as we are used to being delighted with over 30 pts per game almost every week since last year however today the o line being out of groove almost costed things on offense and if this wouldve happened against a better team theres no doubt we wouldve lost this game

i like to focus on the fact that the game was won and thats all it matters but its becoming a serious concern that the offensive line will start affecting play calling and what can be done on offense
the offense wasnt able to take any deep shots or call any deep long developing plays since the pass rush was too intense which immediately took an effect on what hollywood and andrews bring to the table ingram struggled a lot at beginning same with lamar which seemed to bump into sacks since the guys in front were literally being pushed back im hoping since theyll have an extra day of rest this next week they can clean this up otherwise the chiefs defense can make life difficult for them not that theyre an elite defense but theyre pretty damn good if given the opportunity and their opponent is caught slacking
whats most important is how much better lamars passing is hes throwing absolute zingers all day
good points but most teams dont have a garretwatt wrecking shit either those two are elite talents lets see what happens against more pedestrian lines before sounding the alarms
i know im not the only one when i say that this felt like the least rewarding win weve had in a very long time hardly feels like a win at all and to me thats because of everything you just mentioned above

it felt like the last two seasons with joe flacco and marty nothing but dump offs and a few check downs our line effectively ensured that mark andrews brown and the rest of our textbook corp was effectively out of the entire game

oh and also where the fuck was dobbins this entire night besides his 40 yard scamper in garbage time did he have a bad week of practice or something what gives

also we are not going to be win like this against the chiefs or washington with our line so suspect
i felt at times lamar was doubting himself on the rush attempts a couple times i felt he was in two minds
unpopular opinion the ol wasnt as bad as it seemed on passing plays

i thought lamar ran into 2 sacks and was indecisive on a third unlike week 1 most weeks i thought lamar was feeling too many ghost pressures while not reading the leverage of pass rushers which led to sacks for instance tyre phillips had his man blocked on one play lamar scrambled in a way that allowed the dl to uncover and sack him tyre went from doing a good job pass blocking a guy to allowing a sack because his qb ran into the defenders path

the texans did a good job squeezing the pocket with their ends however weve seen lamar move brilliantly in the pocket in situations like that in the past today lamar looked like the lamar we saw in the steelers game last yr

also i thought jj watt in particular was great at readingand attacking the mesh point

either way lamar still had an efficient and productive day he is a great player i just thought he made the ols job harder than it shouldve been today in a few instances

the ols run blocking on the other hand wasnt good in the first half

honestly theres no one who consistently gets the short end of the stick as much as tyrod i really doubt herbert doesnt start after that performance sending all positive vibes to him but man just terrible luck in his career

selfish would love to have him back in charm city if anything happens to rgiii
he looked terrible last week and herbie looked real good today he wont be the starter
tyrod is not good he is a backup
if anyone watched it breaks my heart to see boyle apparently doesnt get along with humphrey
i think its just a joke between marlo and boyle cause if im not mistaken marlon always calls him a jerk and maybe boyle gets a lil hurt from it but i dont think they dont get along
havent seen it but who cares i have disliked a lot of coworkers over the years you cant like everyone
i think its a mixture and of things youve got a quiet ass white guy around a bunch of hype high energy black guys their energy doesnt match at all i dont think its as big of a problem as it seems tho
it didnt seem like anything to me
unpopular opinion marlon strikes me as the kind of guy i would hate to be around every day

that said hes a baller ass corner so who cares what my perception of him is based on limited social media insight
i honestly felt so awkward watching that it really seemed like boyle and andrews hated marlo
why what happened
man its the first im hearing about it but we dont need to more beef or drama in the locker room after the earl thomas shit
damn thats whack lol
marlon honestly sounds irritating lol


bruh these bandwagoners are something else
dudewere not invincible texans have strengths and weaknesses just like we do they have playmakers guys like jj watt are destined to make an impact relax well be fine
naw still feels like a win to me nephew
my god man the browns have garret the texans have watt those two are game wreckers the rest of the talent on those lines ravens oline isnt elite but its certainly not time to sound the alarms yet
found the fan that didnt sit through 201317
duv didnt score
we are 20 i doesnt matter if you win by 1 or 30a wins a win as a matter of fact how does a win feel like a loss
you fans need a damn snickers
all those problems and we still won by 3 scores which tells me we will probably be okay

also duv didnt score
the opponent is allowed to make plays they are professional athletes too
if outgaining our opponent by 100 yards controlling the clock and doubling the scoreboard is getting exposed expose me 14 more times we just took 3 knees inside their 30 to win fella sober up
chill its week 2
man i literally just sat here watching the game and said out loud i still cant figure out how to feel about putting up 30 pts a game consistently its such a change from every year ever no matter how bad the oline play was or how lethargic it seemed you still gotta bring at least a 30 bomb to stay in touch with lamarso far the only teams averaging that besides us is the packers and seahawks and most likely the saints after tomorrow

then you look at the defense and the packers and hawks are giving up 225 pts a game vs our 11 pts a game next best defense is the raiders giving up 15 a game

point is we are the most balanced team in the nfl bringing the most explosive offense with a tough defense neither has to be perfect and can give a little which is what you saw the last two weeks garrett and watt both did what they get paid for some of the best in the game on offense chubb and hunt are gonna get their yards on any night watson is gonna make plays and try to win but nobody is putting it all together like we are right now
you cant fault the o line for giving up the hits to lamar by jj jj is a top echelon defensive player who is capable of making any o line break down it just is what it is theyll get better but im certainly not gonna fault em for not being able to stop jj watt
holy fuck

we got some fans on here actually complaining about the offense not that they played poorly just that they didnt play good enough despite scoring 30 points likei honestly never believed that day would come im an old school ravens fan i remember production like this was rare and appreciated so im a little shocked at some of the posts im seeing its not in big numbers yet

but i would like to remind old and new fans just how good we have it right now old fans that are complaining remember boller and streaky flacco thats all ill say new fans take it easy its 33 points against what i consider to be a good team so hopefully this post puts some of the complaints im seeing into perspective

we are lucky to have lamar

edit furthermore the chiefs didnt do too well on offense either more perspective for you
ill take the w any day of the week you play to win the game
anybody that saw boller and flacco must literally thank their stars to have lamar jackson as qb right now he is far and away the best football player in the league and lets just be thankful we have him flacco was streaky sure but when he stunk he was a lot of wood under center literally
i was at work thinking huh off day for the offense then i thought huh i remember when we beat the bills like 137 only a few short years ago


bandwagoners man
agree with you but offense didnt score 30 pts just want to credit our d which in those days you speak of were also like our offense too today the d scoop n score reminded me of those days
we played a smart game managed our lead and ran out clock

it may not have been big explosive passing plays but it meant we didnt take any risks and maximised our chance of winning the game
new fans are insufferable kids cant appreciate shit
im happy with the comfortable w but am concerned about iol play and still have questions about our passing game we did not necessarily need it today but i still want to see what boykin and hollywood got we might get a chance next week with kansas city
its football lets be happy that we are getting scores from every way possible rushing throwing defensive turnovers well oiled machine
honestly im fine with it shows that as a team we can win different ways depending on how the defense is playing browns want to stop the run lamar throws for 275 and 3 touchdowns texans want to stop the big plays we dink and dunk and run our way to the win

and its only week 2 were 20 while not playing our best
only real complaint is too many sacks never didnt have the lead to complain too badly
idk about others but personally i was concerned just bc we saw what a welloiled machine we were last year and we still came up short im not ungrateful that we can finally expect the team to handle lesser teams but i just get worried what will happen we go up against true championship contenders those teams will exploit your weaknesses
im happy about the offense they are top 5 in the league just concerned about the line its getting lamar killed
most years a lot of teams dont gel until after 4 games this year with no preseason it may be 6 games im happy with the progress though and look forward to more
the bandwagon is real
im almost positive i heard him say he wouldve voted for russ for mvp last year but he lost his ability to vote because he didnt submit his ballot the year before essentially ruining lamars unanimous mvp ive spent enough time listening to him praise pittsburgh as is now that
he is a spiteful hateful sob that has consistently hated on the ravens just listen to that chicken neck fuck call a steelersravens game and youll understand that he is uber biased pos that is the reason why i dont trust pff one bit
ive found i really like tony romo jim nanz

edit charles davis
i believe a few people voted russ allpro but didnt dare vote for anyone else for mvp i dont think collinsworth was one of them though

he is hella biased in his commentary though for the team he prefers
and he would have been the lone idiot there was no one last year that was even remotely close to lamar there is just no arguement to be made for anyone else
what can you expect from a sad and ringless former bengal a team whos only job is to spite the afc division leader
people who think mvp just means elite quarterback with the worst teammates are wrong and stupid and bad
chris collinsworth reminds me always of the gimp from pulp fiction
lamar is still better then wilson
yeah i heard this too and was like what then he was laughing like yah i would have been that one guy oh well

bah
besides all the comments here about bias my biggest beef with collinsworth is hes shitty at his job hell say stuff like that looks like a catch but i dont know what a catch is any more dude its your fucking job how about you look up the goddamn rule and learn what a fucking catch is

edit if i told my boss these javascript libraries keep changing i dont know how to code anymore id be fucking fired
hey wait as an old time fan i love chris collins collinsworth and he has always always had the ravens back as much as a color guy can he called both our superbowls before we even got to the playoffs


this image has been reported
no fro marlo
is marlon finally off the market cuz if you go to that megkurkowski chick in his comments from her instagram story she look likes shes watching his cat snowflake right now

sorry i was bored this morning
noooooooo
hopefully it grows it back
okay why did marlo cut off his fro
is that the joker suit
did he ride his bike to the game
why should anyone care bigger issues in the world these days

yea i heard that too after watching jtuck kick 4 fgs today
tuck wouldve made that 58 yarder too tho
oh ok i wasnt the only one to do this
i hope that next monday night justin tucker hits 63 yard game winner so then we can use the and i took that personally meme
seems people have already forgotten about that 61 yard gw but whatever
romo is such a chiefs blowhard i honestly am happy we dont have them for the chiefs he never sea impressed by lamar
i did the same thing
i felt the same watching the 2 pats games and the commentator going on about cams option read play and how long he holds the ball while making the read like seriously did you watch a single ravens game in 2019
tucker is the greatest kicker of all time
if i hear the words best kicker its a built in trigger in my brain itll catch my attention everytime
im not looking for a butker vs tucker duo jackson vs mahomes is what we are coming for
anyone notice the obvious hes playing in a fucking stadium when he kicks 58 yards go kick 58 yards in fucking charm city brother
automatic
who
i know all of reddit loves him but i really dont think romo is that great of an announcer

lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season never this type of adulation even before the season started alot of folks annointed russ the mvp
why was it so diff from lamar it seems to me russell is the perfect type of qb and face for the nfl they want to promote not the florida dialect heavy qb
lamar was voted a unanimous mvp i think he got his recognition
lamar got plenty of praise once the season was underway last year he was unanimous mvp

russell wilson is arguably the best qb playing right now and hes a good dude deserves every bit of it
if youre going by that broadcast than yea collins would suck wilsons dick dry if he could but right now wilson is dominating his numbers are ridiculous

praising one qb is not a knock on another
lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season never this type of adulation

lol wut did you not watch the games or follow the media last year

yes a lot of people are saying that its wilsons turn but his play so far has been worthy of being considered its a long season and if awards were given in the preseason the browns would have won the superbowl last year
people were all over lamars dick man

he was unanimous mvp cover of madden running on sports center nonstop people were constantly saying oh my god he actually can pass

it was glorious not sure what planet you were on but this post just sounds whiny af
bro dont be salty lamar gets tons of praise

russ has more tds than incompletions rn dude is balling
rconspiracy
russells that good though
lets not have conspiracy theory crap here please once the ravens beat the seahawks last year it was nonstop praise for lamar last year or did you just conveniently forget that
maybe youre looking too into it granted russ was receiving a lot of recognition last season too and rightfully so he was doing great too but lamar did unanimously win mvp theres no more recognition than that and youd see a highlight of lamar posted every chance the nfl could post it russ is just playing insane at the moment and hopefully he can continue cause hes a baller and a great person
lamar was unproven at that point and announcersmedia just play it safe they know russ is great so they dont have to really face the music if he ends up playing poorly enough to lose mvp or mvp votes


of drew lock or haskins came out this season playing like wilson did they wouldnt get the hype from media people because the media people do not have much to work with from other seasons


lamar did get hype pretty early on though
dude there are many other players in the league who excell russell wilson is playing incredibly well right now the dude is making insane throws his production with the olines hes had is amazing lamar is doing lamar things he was the unanimous mvp last year its ok for other people to get attention

the media slobbed on our knobs all last year lamar won player of the week i dont know how many times like yes lamar has faced adversity for how he sounds but this just seems like a bit of a stretch to me
lamar never got praise what is this man talking about he literally got the mvp lol
lets not be like seahawks fans last year there is no reason to shit on russ to try and prop up lamar let russ get his well deserved hype and focus on the ravens
little known fact

the announcers are supposed to talk about the teams on the field at the game they are assigned to
wilson has earned it for the time being
lamar was the talk of the league all last season russell wilson has been in the league for a long time and is finally getting credit where its due he deserves it hes an excellent qb

its a damn shame his talent and effort is being wasted under bill o brien i hope the best for deshaun hes great
this poor guy always looks so disheveled when he plays us
free deshaun i heard a texans fananalyst say they got away from hopkins because his separationspeed didnt fit their profile how much speed does bob want will fuller kenny stills brandon cooks wtf
that one throw he made while being hit by 2 dudes today was absolutely ridiculous i feel bad for this guy he needs to go to a winning team and not some team whos ran by a clown who traded a generational talent and arguably the best wr in the league in his prime just pls dont go to the steelers because big bens time is almost up and theyre desperately going to need a qb
the texans were my 2 before the trade diehard ravens all the way tho i cant associate with that stupidity anymore

ride or die ravens
with clemson he was very strong
i think that watson will be a better match with jackson than rgiii

reminds me of ed reed
that pick was insane one of the best i have ever seen ngl
we just making deshaun watsons day even worse lmao

side note that was a great fucking pick tho
since 2015 when he came into the league peters has 28 picks no one else even has 20 in that timeframe

x200b

he is the ed reed of corners and is now where he belongs
why dont i see this play on rnfl
no love on sportscenter
no throw only take
looks like that pick he had against the rams
just came out of nowhere mr pick6 back at again
i thought this was the best play all day even the receiver thought he had it you can see him close his hands in anticipation of the catch and juiceman snatched it out from in front of him
thats a straight ed reed play make an amazing catch and immediately get up and look around to see where hes gonna run for a td mp is just a baller man
really want to see the all22 for this one hurry up gamepass
great pick
so smooth my eyes became dinner rolls when he flew in from the edge of the screen


fuck yes rravens vs rkansascitychiefs gif wars are back

i am almost as excited for this as i am the matchup
this is great how do you even make these im so pumped for ravens chiefs gif war 2
goddam i love kansas city week
so damn wholesome this is gonna be a good week
where is ben
this is the week for kansas city joes zman sandwiches with a side of old bay chips

or maryland crab cakes and whatever kc does for sides dunno i usually just go into a meat coma when i visit family out there
i was actually asleep when you posted this which is the most pointed part of it
begun the meme wars have
and so it begins
that asterisk for the knock is genius
this got me so excited well done
we definetly need ubenrosen
i wish all chiefs fans were like you rkansascitychiefs if only
unpopular opinion or sheer fact real pity
webb was better and slightly healthier
idk why everyone feels the need to shit on tavon


view poll

after 2 weeks this guy has stood out for me

he looks so fast

cant wait to see his progression throughout the year
he had a lot of good plays yesterday including some that wont show up on the stat sheet his coverage on the te on the early 4th down play that led to ricards td was great that was a pick six if watson makes a better throw and i counted at least twice when watson could have scrambled for an easy conversion on third down but queen took a good angle and cut him off with his speed

zero stats on all those plays but each potentially could have altered the course of the game

he needs to work on playing downhill and david johnson shook him to get wide open though watson overthrew him badly but he was billed as being really fast and really smart and so far weve seen that shine through
if he learns how to watch the qb from peters we could have an elite level ballhawk and blitz artist
proving to ozzie that lsu boys can ball too

thats basically a thumb spica splint not a cast they can be worn for either acute injuries or chroniclong standing injuries that they want to protect this could be anything from a simple sprain to a small fracture if his hands have been heavily tapedbraced all year this could just be an ongoing thing but hes also and olineman so it shouldnt hinder him too much
these guys get their hands caught up all the time thats why their hands are always fubar like booger mcfarland
did anyone peep nick boyle actually being upset with marlon said hes always a dick to him in the locker rooms or something and didnt bump fists with him hmmmm it was honestly hella awkward cause it was at the end of his live video
the way he was playing against jj watts it looked like his whole body was in a cast
if im not mistaken hes been in one of those before
justin tucker right down the middle
baltimore ravens are super bowl champions
the hay is in the barn
fuck the steelers patriots and browns
almost as good as harrison butker s s s
baltimore the lombardi trophy is yours

he wouldnt secure shit
the team was worse last year with jefferson lol
please god no
nope
smith played a lot of safety even after tavon went to the sideline it seems they are happier with smith at the hybrid safety role and averett dont know how to spell as the slot
honestly tavon is a luxury our defense was good without him it will continue to be good without him i honestly think we dont even need tavon
oh piss off
possible et3 reunion
tj was only horrible because they played him out of position and made him handle play calling responsibilities in his nature position without that responsibility he is a baller recency bias is very strong though

this user posted across multiple nfl subreddits this is by every definition spam
do we bring him up from the practice squad now that young is done for the year i dont think we can operate with 4 corners
its monday morning let eric get into the office

were in good hands
i was thinking this as well id imagine bonds gets promoted and we make geno stone active on game day

this allows us also to move elliott and stone around i could see jimmy now getting looks at s more

we are ahead of them because we are 10 in the division not that it really matters in week 2
that cant be right when you sort it by division were leading because we have a division game in hand and better conference record then when you sort by league were ahead of them again and best in the afc
they arent according to the nfl app we are first in the afc
thats not even true nor would it matter at all if it was
oh dear god
offer no longer appears in my dunkin app does dunkin think ravens will win so much that it will hurt its profits
weve won but at what cost
they changed it to a free coffee on game days so you still get a fee one but itll usually be on sundays now
im from sc and we used to get like 199 glazed dozen donuts after panthers win just so happened they made the sb that year and we havent had it since
do you see the qb we have now

he looks like he only plans on losing 12 game a year

so to answer your question yes

go ravens
its free coffee on ravens game days now i got mine yesterday
does anyone have info on this guy for the texans he was all over the field in the game yesterday making shoe string tackles against 23 blockers with no backup probably saved over 100 yards of offense i saw 2018 3rd rounder but we should go after this guy for our team looks like a straight playmaker wears a good number too
that play where he fought off andrews block to tackle lamar in the fourth was nasty if he doesnt a break past a man 50 pounds heavier than him and b tackle one of the most elusive runners in football then lamar was going to take that 80 yards to the house and wed have gotten a nice halfquarter of rgiii
definitely had a good game today but he got juked for a touchdown by a rookie rb last week

it was crazy because that dude kept up with lamar most of the game every time he tried to turn the corner for a big gain he was right there
yeah reid looked good as did watt and hargraves
so now were gonna ask edc to sign every player that has a good game vs us

smh
and justin tucker putting an end to the dumbass debate nantz and romo started still cant believe these guys acted like tucker didnt even exist

its a new kicker every year that someone says is better and then by the end of the year its clear that justin tucker is yet again the best kicker in the league
man i want to like romo but hes got no love for baltimore
meh tuckers suffering from the mj effect hes so damn good for so damn long the medias rushing to find someone else thats close to tuckers level to generate clicks other kickers have tried to claim the prize of goat kicker and theyve all fallen one by one

plus tuckers got it easy now with lamar and harbaugh embracing analytics on 4th downs he used to have to m kick 50 yd field goals 710 times a season with flacco he only had one last year with lamar starting every game thats insane
i love how personally we are taking this you may insult my mother and you may insult my children but you will not insult my kicker and survive this day
i would be okay with ravens v chiefs games just being a kicking competition no game just 2 special teams units going at it
what was the stat the announcers made in game like 64 field goals in a row when the distance is under 40 thats some legendary stuff right there
how insecure are we that we are hoping an opposing kicker misses kicks so our kicker looks better let tuckers performance speak for itself i hope butler makes multiple 50 yarders and tucker just out kicks him besides butker misses too many xps to be compared to tucker his fg kicking is very good but his xp is league average
idiots do as idiots see fish in a pond syndrome
apparently chiefs kicking unit have been caught possibly cheating

looks like the questions might have been too tough no 3 or 6 point winners better luck this week as the ravens host the chiefs on to the good stuff

for the third question at the time we guessed it was longest rush under results it says longest pass play longest rush was dobbins at 44 so 2145 would be the right guess

it also has a deadline of 1228 to make your guess and the week 3 matchup says chiefs at texans

fellas the podcast is pretty good first episode was kamara he talked about having to play hurt under nick saban and he just couldnt talked about junior college and how it was a horrible experience i like kamara a lot cool personality but he doesnt show accountability for his actions nothing is ever his fault the hollywood brown episode dropped today and ill check it out tonight
i dont wanna sound too entitled ravens won but something was off was it because the llama got too many sacks or llama didnt throw dimes like he did against the browns


something feels off
lamars passing was still great in this game

the issue is the offensive line lamar is not getting a clean pocket and the running game is getting very little help

outside of a few games we have a very easy regular season schedule the team is talented enough that poor oline play will not sink us but if this is not addressed in time for the postseason then were in trouble
interior of the offensive line is a liability

outside linebackers are also avg at best
every team has its weaknesses those are the most glaring ones that i see after 2 weeks

i just hope the line doesnt get lamar injured
the interior is a problem theres a midlevel prospect a guy recovering from a major knee injury and a rookie in there whereas last year the rookies spot was filled by a surefire halloffamer stanley is also playing injured but the sack he gave up yesterday wasnt his fault lamar just chose the wrong lane and ran himself into that one brown struggled with watt but watt is also the toughest test hell have to face this year man is a mutant

there were a lot of pass plays called but the texans threw a lot of eightman boxes up there so as much as i dont like it it was still the right choice in the end this was a classic ravens game with the run game and defence being the tools by which we won even though the pass game brought in some big plays

i really didnt like their goal line moves in the fourth though with around five minutes left instead of just lining up power they used outside runs that went out of bounds including a lamar run which was about the worst possible play in that situation because either lamar has to go out of bounds and stop the clock or has to take a big hit in a three score game its not the end of the world but setting bad habits is never good
i feel like lamar should be changing the protection at the line more by now even though some of the sacks phillips and brown straight up got beaten

but i think we were ok poorly is a stretch texans were playing not to get blown out and go 02 most teams know about lamars speed now especially the texans after last season they locked on to andrews all game long and zach cunningham job was basically to get to the sideline before lamar if he scrambled that man was dead tired by the 4q thats why those runs started coming in chunks and the end the first 3q was houston playing on all madden and it still wasnt enough to beat us they were so tired theyre lucky we ran out of clock if that game was 5 mins long it might have ended 5016
here is exactly why it feels like we played shitty especially offensively we only scored 2 offensive touchdowns one of which was only a 34 yard drive that was set up from a turnover

heres why we shouldnt worry we had 8 drives excluding the last one that was just to milk the clock out 5 of those drives we went at least 58 yards yes 4 of those 5 drives only ended in field goals and not touchdowns but the texans d is a top half d in the league with some top playmakers and really did their homework in shutting us down nearin the red zone then of course we had the 34 yard drive td which only leaves 28 drives that didnt come away with points us scoring on 75 of drives is an even higher rate than last year where we averaged scoring 58 of drives it still fields weird because of the more fgs as the breakdown of this game was 25 tddrive 50 fgdrive when we averaged 40 tddrive 17 fgdrive last year
we had 16 rushing yards in the first half we finished with around 230 rushing yards this both greatly excites me and greatly worries me
the offensively line play has been poor yanda is missed
we didnt run the ball early in the game lamar had his runs but we didnt feed the running backs it always feels like we arent as efficient if we dont run the ball early in the game
oline definitely is our weakest group especially the right side good thing is barring injury they should get better as phillips develops as a player and they work on their cohesion but yeah no yanda hurts us bad
the offense line was bad and while they ran a lot in the second half when they were up a bit in the first half they forgot their strength is still running the ball lj was running for his life
as others pointed out the oline isnt what it was last year and its not just about the rookie the whole unit just doesnt look as good compared to last year nothing to panic about just yet though chiefs next week and washington whose dline was amazing week 1 the week after will be a good test

also maybe its just me but it seemed like watson started to find the right guys to pick on in coverage especially when tavon went down queen averett levine elliot all seemed to me like they got targeted often in coverage
would just like to point out that the stretch of dominance where we demolished the texans rams jets etc all in a row was not something you should expect to see again for a long time

great teams find ways to win even when they arent firing on all cylinders

with that said yeah this team very clearly needs help in the interior ol and secondary depth weve still got guys on the team we could try and fill those spots with and i trust edc to make moves if we continue to struggle
if the oline doesnt get their shit together were not going to be opening up the deep game this year lamar needs more time to throw

but at the same time hes been getting blitzed at a pretty high rate he needs to recognize this and either make a shift or stop standing in the pocket to get drilled if watson can roll out and avoid a sack surely the best running qb maybe the best runner in the league can do the same
oline needs to be taken care of
the oline will need to improve
yeah to add to what everyone else is saying yes we have played poorly but despite that weve still had double digit wins and really actually dominated once this team starts to gel and play better think how scary they can be
the interior oline is not playing well as everyone mentioned the good news is that since we have such an amazing qb it hasnt affected us too much since he is so good at escaping and running to the outside if we had any other qb we would have been struggling to get any yardage the whole game
can anyone say theyre too surprised to see the hole left by yanda i mean really

guess which side most of those sacks came from

i dont think its an issue we need to be too worry about like yeah there is a weakness there but its not downright a hindrance like other teams oline problems hell the texans oline was worse than ours watson took 13 hits yesterday
definitely our offensive line looked off
pass protection was bad this game youre definitely not alone in that

we also initially was having issues with putting pressure on watson though we got to him a lot in the second half and with tavon going down our cb position look thin af again
does anybody know why we put tyre philips in immediately we have dj fluker whos a vet tyre needed to sit for a little at least it just doesnt make sense to me
they certainly did i felt the air of melancholy as i woke up this morning typically after a ravens win i feel energized and happy we played very poorly in all phases to give up 16 points to the texans and score only 33 is pathetic by our standards
expect one of two positions to be filled very soon via a trade by edc oline andor cb
youre not wrong stat watchers claiming we ran all over em didnt watch the game we put up 100 rushing yards in trash time until the 4th we were struggling bc oline if it werent for the turnovers the game could have gone very different d deserves a lot of credit more than anyone imo
some of those sacks should be attributed to lamar holding the ball too long but tyre phillips is a huge liability at rg and skura and orlando brown are a bit shaky around him
not every game is gonna be played perfectly there were multiple changes to the offensive an defensive lines theres going to be a period of adjustmentsposts like these make you sound like patriot fans when they dont get their way

as soon as i recognized the scene a smile popped up good stuff


20 baby


gus a thicc boi
next monday we spar against those punks from mahomido karate
lol cobra truss
jk dobbins is extremely handsome
justice hill in shambles
you can sweep mahomess leg but hes going to crane kick you for the win in the end who cares if kicks to the face are explicitly against the rules

no
sell out
why are you selling it
here is the link
the fact that this game could become a way too early but still significant match to see who gets home field advantage makes the hype so much more
i mean it was the same shit last year i mean no one thought we would end up being the 1 team at that point but we still were 20 and a playoff team and lamar was emerging at that point and we still didnt even get a primetime game
im definitely concerned for this game cuz we have a shit pass rush and lost tavon young im hoping the oline can get their shit together and we can go out and score 40 to try and out score mahomes our d is great but the best way to defend mahomes is to rush him and pressure him quick and we dont really have a joey bosa to do that like the chargers however we also have lamar whos looking like hes taken the next step in his passing game i think as long as he gets some decent protection we can win this game
lets beat the champs
i really wish they would let some fans in
i wish this game were later in the season it has very few implications on week 3

toasty
this is wonderful
lol in the texans sub someone commented about him doing their logo dirty

i was doing laundry and thought it was lamar at first and was like why is lamar running so weird then realized it was ingram
if i wasnt poor youd have gold
fatality
flawless victory
sprite mark ingram is the best mark ingram
damn it i was expecting the music
all i hear is peter griffin saying roadhouse
marktial artist mark ingram ii

its crazy how good our schedule is this year
i think when you go 142 you deserve a good travel plan
this is so favorable its going to get stuffed down our throats by the rest of the league for the remainder of the season oh well hopefully it ends with a sb for them to stew about
chiefs and pitt x2 are the only games im remotely worried about honestly
that is a good schedule we might not even have many close games which we really need to get ready for the playoffs
wont have to board another flight until nov 8



are we taking the train to philly or something normally i wouldnt mind but with covid19 that seems a little risky
removed
everyone has a right to their opinion but i dont think this post is it youre making it seem like mahomes is trash especially when you say the ravens wouldnt make the playoffs if he was our qb thats a terrible take the guy just won the superbowl and had a great game
i love lamar and am glad hes my quarterback but im not a homer to the point where i say hes better than mahomes

theyre both truly excellent also you giving no credence to that defensive line from the chargers is kind of telling

edit this kid is 17 years old and has a lot to learn any kc fans lurking he doesnt represent all of us so please dont say ravens fans are saying lamar is better than mahomes when its this one dumb kid
i think this year there honestly can be an argument made
bro ive been a lamar fan since his freshman year at louisville but this is a bad take mahomes is easily the best qb in the league no question and rn russ is probably better too dont use 2 games this season to judge him mahomes stats through his career so far are literally on another level compared to anyone else in nfl history you can definitely make the case that lamar has played better than mahomes in his 2 games this season but come on mahomes is overall a better player and thats ok cuz lamar is pretty damn good too
looks like th 5g finally got someone
im a ravens fan

both are great players

mahomes has beaten lamer twice

i say right now mahomes is better right now
this aint it fam
youre an idiot

i love lamar but hes not better than mahomes its not a knock on lamar but his arm talent as a passer isnt on mahomes level sure jackson is a better runner but mahomes is more than good enough moving around in the pocket and scrambling when he needs to
you are epitome of what shitty fans are

go back to hs with your stupid takes
id say mahomes is better right now

lamar is making it an argument hard to argue with the raw arm talent of mahomes right now though hate to use some cliche type arguments but if im sitting in the super bowl in the 4th quarter with the game on the line and i need a big throw mahomes is still clearly the guy between the two
shake off that purple vision dude this post is not it

he has to rely on his kicker this is so so far off my man think you should school up a little
nice satire
mahomes is still 1a and jacksonwilson are 1b and 1c lamar needs to get over the playoff hump and get that sb ring first mahomes is just on another level right now and i love my llama
so stats dont lie mahomes had more touchdowns and more yards than lamar and mahomes was apparently trash last game so does that make lamar trash needs a kicker to bail him out tucker had a total of 15 points the defense scored a td and a fb had to bail him out with an amazing catch from a crappy throw lamar holds a rushing record but mahomes has more superbowls and playoff wins as well as he will be the quickest qb to throw 10000 yards hes 98 yards shy of the record your eating to many purple pills if you think lamar is better than mahomes at this point in his career
i think that they are neck and neck hard to say that one is better of course i always say lamar is because he is my lord and savior but him and mahomes are both up there a super bowl this year would edge lamar ahead imo but there are some great qbs this year wilson murray arod allen even cam newton looks like he did in 2016 but dont ever come off that hill cuz we need soldiers like you up there
hopefully we get to enjoy this argument for years to come i for one welcome the new era of elite qbs
lot of nonbeleers for a ravens sub looking like an rnfl thread

shame on all of you
well fuck this one obviously is poking some nerves
and i love the fandom too
for real his weapons are insane
i like your passion they are both great qbs but post season wins is kinda important

i love lamar jackson
lamar jackson
the most humble the most dynamic the most talented and the hardest working qb in the league whats not to love oh by the way he is only 23 and younger than burrow whose asshole most pundits are burrowing their heads into and sniffing like its cocaine
lamar jackson



we should make this move incredibly versatile player who would fill void left by tavon
him and tavon are the best slot corners in the league so idk how well roster 2

granted tavon going on ir but trading for king would let tavon know hes gone
loved him coming out of iowa i dont see how it would happen but that would be a dream
source dont see anything about it on rnfl or rchargers but if true i agree that we should go after him
im hip him or robey coleman is cool with me
trade a 3rd or 4th for him on his expiring rookie deal and receive a 4th round comp pick when he leaves in the offseason a 1 year rental to move down 1 or 2 rounds in the draft more than worth it
we need to resign players to big contracts they need to come first
edc warming up his fifth rounders
if they accept a 4th wed actually end up recouping it with a comp pick should we fail to retain him
yeeeeeeeessssss love him
can never have enough talented corners slot or otherwise for a team that is run by speedy small receivers like tyreek hill and others we can afford to have both i say this trade is coming soon to a theater near you
i wanted him so bad based on yt hype videos lol

i think he had a poor 40 yard time and seeing him go as late as 5th or 6th made me wonder why we didnt take a chance on him could have plugged the defense and return jobs
im an iowa alum so of course id like another hawkeye but as always ill just trust the front office to do what they do

dont worry we got it this year
they wear 8
removed
the memes would be endless
wait is going from the jets to the ravens even allowed
truss
for those who might not knowthere was an undrafted free agent named lamar jackson who plays cornerback

he signed with the jets and is surely available for pennies on the dollar
cant wait to see his jackson five
hes an upgrade to averett
happy as fuck with the team

just an observation

when one of our guys makes an outstanding play on o he almost always rewarded with the very next offensive play call

if i notice it d coordinators absolutely are too the reward play is almost zero net yards

lets get to the word to greg


if anything ive noticed lamar seems to feed the ball back to people who mess up almost like an effort to keep them in the game for instance ricard fumbled that ball at the goal line last week but lamar went to him knocking on the door this week
i cant say ive noticed this at all can you give some examples
lol
one of the quickest lbs ive ever seen dude is just a
solid player and i think hes becoming one of the best players on this defense slowly but surely
idk about one of the quickest lbs ever seen but hes definitely blossoming into a staple on the d love fort
hes auditioning to be overpaid by the jets colts or browns

get your money lj
he stands out in the defense dude is always around the ball
he deserves pro bowl recognition this year

help us ubenrosen youre our only hope

edit and so it begins
its happening
that was good lol
mannnnnn he had to chose walken dammit upvotes he gets
what is this from
this game is going to feature the greatest kicker of all time

also justin tucker is pretty good as well

noice
very excellent

respect
this aged well
wait did you just try to make lumbergh look like the cool one
you played the browns and the texans lmao simmer down
but it didnt matter because the ravens beat them in all phases of the game

i dont understand why but lamar jackson seemed slower yesterday
i wish wed taken advantage of this more their whole defense especially cunningham was locked in on lamars runs take half of lamars 16 carries and spread them across ingram gus and dobbins and i bet we gain at least an extra 40 yards on the ground and score an extra td
not bad for a rb eh

good one ryan
good answer too theres a lot of technique in arm wrestling a lot of people dont know and get there asses kicked

this is fanfuckingtastic

join us in running it back
yes this is the jpg shoddiness that i crave
lamarvelous decimus meridius
love it missed opportunity for the kid to be suggs d
only reason lamar would temporarily put his weapon down against kc
i was really hoping it would be lamar with the shades when he turned around thank you for not disappointing this was awesome
you had me at unanimous mvp fuckin brilliant
love it
nice work smiling the whole ride
why does mahomes look like eric andre in those pics near the end what was happening to him in that picture who filled him with that energy
good job
lmao when he turned around fucking brilliant
i fucking love chiefs week



this is good stuff hahaha
and thats all i have to say about that
this gif war is the only good thing to come from 2020


at least some people will be at the game 250 of close family members of the team and staff included but ill take whatever at this point baby
step in the right direction for allowing fans to eventually get in the stadium wish they used week 1 as this trial period so we couldve gotten some fans in for the chiefs game
i want to hate lamar i really do i want to buy into the false narrative that hes a rbwr and not a true qb i hate that his name keeps being put in the same sentence as mahomes im trying to nitpick at his performances to find some tangible differences that will knock him down a peg but i cant qb vs qb im not ready to put much weight on their postseason records just yet its a team game neither is out there throwing stupid interceptions causing their team to lose it takes a village to win all that went right for mahomes will also go right for lamar in the post season

i truly hope these guys become the next brady vs manning going tit for tat for the next 10 yrs it makes the game that much more entertaining i want to be deathly afraid of the ravens the gif wars have been fantastic but the comments that a few people leave sometimes are borderline cringeworthy 95 of the script is hilarious for both teams but you have that one guy who needs to nitpick on the 5 and get all defensive mainly over a stat

i love mahomes and im loving lamar i wanted to paint him as another michael vick or cam newton great but not legendary but he completely won me over last season when he wore the white sleeves and glove after the skin color comments gangsta move which made me a fan hoping for both qbs to make highlight reel plays and for a nail biter of a game will make the afc championship rematch in january that much more drama filled
the same to you sir may our otherworldly quarterbacks continue to dominate together and entertain against one another for years to come
most of us feel the same you can appreciate both qbs what a time to be a fan of either team
much love man mahomes arm and football iq is unparalleled so is lamars athletic ability both make great plays and have great arms
i think lamar mahomes and russ are the top 3 qbs and any order of them is acceptable imo im just happy all three are so likeable im rooting for mahomes every other day except monday and the playoffs
truzz chiefs may our qbs stay healthy and have long entertaining careers
same here i want to hate mahommes but i just cant these 2 qbs are changing the game and hopefully they have a long but friendly rivalry
keep the gifs coming

iron sharpens iron
well said cant wait for all the games to come
yes man i feel the same way bout mahomes
first rational chiefs fan thank you for actually seeing things the way they actually are
i want to hate lamar i wanted to paint him as another michael vick or cam newton

alrighty then

49ers fan supporting the ravens against the chiefs thats sus we got an imposter lol
idk how to feel about this
as a ravens fan please for the love of christ invest in knee braces before the game at metlife
hahaha 49er fans still salty after that asskicking delivered in liv i love it

how great would it be for madubuike to come in and tear it up for us

just need to send the madden adjuster the tape of his pick in the texans game should boost his rating to the 90s
i still love marcus peters wish he hadnt picked a fight with his coach on the sideline because he would have been a legend by now if he had stayed with the chiefs


3rd best rb on the field that day
this is gold well played
lol i love that this has more upvotes in our sub than here
hes the only priest ive ever loved what a great back if i recall correctly he had a similar injury to bo jackson are there chiefs fans trying to claim suggs as our own thats absurd i guess we could do the same with joe montana

edit now i see what you were talking about that is a funny picture of suggs

this isnt koolaid or hyperbole it is simply a fact lamars incredible electricity running the ball blinds people to his otherworldly skills in passing the ball and seeing the field and leading the offense all his weapons save snead are rookies or on rookie contracts not so much the other supposed qb competition what lamar can do demoralize and devastate opponents nobody can do

sure some can throw a flier every now and then that highly paid receivers can catch and win a game for them but consistently nobody can take over a game like lamar jackson his humility work ethic dedication to winning focus athleticism ability to make no name players probowlers the way his teammates go out to bat for him and his sheer talent make him incomparable you just need to remove those jaundiced eye glasses to see it

by seasons end hell be having his say my name moment to all the naysayersdoubtersskin color bigots and the rest of the polian fan club members

why wait folks just say his name now lamar jackson lamar jackson lamar jackson
youre definitely the biggest lamar homer on this sub lol but i love it hope youre right on all your posts
i know this is just hyperbole but it does feel like were only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how he can perform
i really think hell end up as an all time great this generations steve young but faster
lamar can take over a game but so can mahomes ive seen him do it does mahomes have more talented and distinguished receivers yes but mahomes and lamar are neck and neck obviously i choose my qb but you are discrediting mahomes

side note i really wish et wasnt such a bitch and just bought into the culture hes still probably the best free safety in the world we went from a mostly cover 1 defense to a cover 2 or 3 the moment we lost him clark being versatile and smart as fuck makes the loss less noticeable but if we didnt have clark we would be exposed in the secondary even if the 3 great corners we have still healthy played perfectly
yeahe had a solid year i wish it wouldve worked out
he could just be a pocket passer and he would be one of the best in the league dudes a phenomenon and still underrated
i love it hes young jordan right now with the doubters its fun to be on the ground floor im here for it all
this made me laugh
but hes only a running back lol
haters from the chiefs voting this post down keep the upvoting going ravens fans for ravens pride


lmao at the caws at the end by god thats my calling card
my spiciest gif yet sure to lose me a few new friends over in the kc sub i still love you chief bros but you know what they say about fairness war and hell

the sad chief noises and caws killed me
tenderness
just absolutely beautiful
im aroused
this gif war is the pinnacle of human achievement
tenderness

fuckin great
can i just make it official that we won this gif war
i really like this one
i didnt realize that suggs isnt a chief anymore i was looking forward to seeing him again on monday
caw
dude the caws at the end had me rolling this is the best gif ive seen so far out of both subs
this is gold

the chiefs at one point were the big playoff chokers 22 year chokers
delightful
im loving the meme war
uvredditdownloader
caw
oh my
tenderness
im dying
i fucking love chiefs week
thats gold caw caw
suggs a free agent tho
they made a gif saying to bring them their trophies like bih we got two of them
i dont get how these keep getting better and better
now that is top notch
brilliant
the ravens may be the least evil team in the nfl
one of the best ones yet
i dont think i ever realized ben mendelsohn was in this movie
sad chiefs noise lol im crying
bravo my dude
he ded lmaoooooo
i like this then we can do another one in a couple months with batman aka mahomes finishing u guys off in the end playoffs


cant get mad at this one it was funny as hell
were just glad you guys finally got your second after all those years and years of waiting

seriously it doesnt matter that the ravens were founded then won two trophies in literally half the time it took the chiefs to get from one to two what matters is we both have the same number of trophies

kidding aside awesome gif man loved it
amazing
should have been specifically between mahomes and lamar would have stung more we have the same sb wins teamwise

x200b

good addition to the war tho
the worst part is you cant even counter with lamars awards because mahomes did all the same things in 2018


the guy from the gebco ad played for the ravens
they gotta bring back the lineman face masks with the vertical bar down the middle it looked so tough
i remember reading a scouting report on jo coming out of ucla saying something to the effect of ogden is so dominant that he could play most games with a cup of coffee in one hand and not miss a beat pretty goddamn accurate summation of the mans nfl career too
on top of how talented and dominant he was it seems like hes one of the chillest and nicest guys around i saw him at the stadium on the lower concourse in the beer line for some random november game a few years ago i was about to go say hi and ask for a pic but a couple guys got to him first and i didnt want to start a line or commotion and bother him they showed him on the jumbotron later in the game and he was in fact just sitting in the lower bowl with the rest of the plebs you have to be down to earth to be a guy so instantly recognizable and sit with the fans without any privacy
x200b

im on team averett


most of us just want to see him make a play just one
this depicts the wrong number as he now wears 23 he has changed every season 28 in 2018 34 in 2019 23 in 2020 i wonder which double digits he will wear next year that is if he is even still here
averett would start for quite a few teams people dont realize how blessed we are at the position

this is unbelievably disturbing

beleeat dat
ocho more like ochenta y ocho

i just want to point out that this is an entire article written about a picture posted by bonds trainer that does not say bonds has beenis going to be elevated to the active roster

this could just as easily mean that hes the practice squad player that will be active and not coming up to the 53

im always proud when these guys get their shot
is he a slot corner

really hoping marlon can get back to the outside this season as imo he plays far better on the outside
hell be in 3rd down pass plays hes quick shifty tackles above his weight class and is fast
id rather see this guy get his shot than continue to watch anthony averett get beat up and down the field like hes trying to compete with frank walker and corey ivy for worst ravens cb ever

wait is that stitched where how beautiful jersey btw
that looks clean as hell
i dont want to come off as a hater but why do the name and number seem so off center from one another
fresh
looks fake

why isnt he playing he still has one good leg
cant be mad at hoping it wasnt blown tho
anyone have any deer antler spray
get him out there on wheels
im more interested why we havent made the roster moves with him yet it definitely points to promoting from practice squad and not fa
gentlemen we can rebuild him we have the technology we have the capability to make the worlds first bionic man tavon young will be that man better than he was before better stronger faster
his size paired with his style of play what is holding him back think bob sanders while not as ferocious of a hitter he is a very pesky and physical defender despite being undersized if he were 6 205 he would be our 1 corner by a long shot do you see how he was draped all over njoku when he gave up that catch week 1 thats a sub 59 guy on a te
is this guy really out for the season again what a joke

imagine losing a gif war this badly then you might understand kansas citys pain

context chiefs guy can basically open people up as if they were books and write anything he wants on them and it becomes true he writes lamar guy cant hit him but when he insults his hair he loves his hair lamars anger transcends chief guys abilities and proceeds to pummel him

its from the jojos bizarre adventure anime one of the longest running and most influential manga in japan fantastic show for anyone into that stuff

i would hate if the ravens had to bury a man who was a staple of our defense for so many years after all his legacy of ball so hard university is forever embedded in this subreddit
is he no longer on the team
was his contract just a one year
didbhevretire
if he was going to be buried anywhere you know hed want it done at the bank

which means he wants to win by thirty points
when louis riddick asked lamar if he watched mahomes and wonder if he can take anything from his game and lamar just answered back nah

lol i find it so funny and rejuvenating how lamar is so straight up most qbs will just give you a cookie cutter response to those sort of questions
hopefully he kicks ass like any other game llama god
427 what a baller response
lamars say my name moment came with the nah i dont as a direct slap on that punk intervieweroriginal lamar haters face
why is lamar letting this pos interview him this is the same punk that was nodding his head in obedience when polian proclaimed lamar should move to wr why give this punk the interview i dont get it
good its a nondivision game in week 3 isnt that important in the grand scheme we lost in weeks 3 and 4 last year and how much relevance did that end up having

i have no clue how these numbers are generated but dk against the pats looked really good and while hollywood hasnt been bad by any means just hasnt had much opportunity to flash so far
hmm i was already feeling like he needed more targets now i definitely feel like he needs more targets
this wr class has some potential to be one of the goats as a collective

hollywood diontae terry dk aj deebo mecole renfrow and slayton all have looked good

and this doesnt count harry p williams or d harris
hes too small
hollywood needs more targets at least 79 per game imo
i honestly thought metcalf would be higher
i thought dk metcalf was gonna suck guess it really is just a matter of scheming to a players strength
fo sho is that still a thing

when mike tyson is in awe of you just know youre a really big deal lamar jackson


i cant believe how well shatner seems to be holding up guy will be 90 next year
long post warning

with our upcoming game against the defending super bowl champions i was reminded of a conversation i had with a coworker back in 2010 about the ravens he wasnt a fan and he was constantly talking trash to me about that years team and how they werent as good as their record etc we played the saints late that season who were coming off their super bowl win the year previous they were 103 coming into the game against us in baltimore and meanwhile the ravens were a strong contender at 94 the ravens won the game it was an excellent game i recommend trying to find it or watching the highlights here seriously the lance moore catch is one of the craziest ive ever seen i remember throwing it in my coworkers facehere was proof that we were a legit team knocking off the defending champs was it empirical or definitive no but it felt good either way

so i decided to look at the history of how the ravens fared when they have faced the defending super bowl champions and then i did it for the rest of the league as well to see how the ravens were in comparison had they played moreless games against champs and how did their record compare

ravens history vs defending champs

to start the ravens have played 10 games in their 24 seasons against the defending nfl champions in those games we are 64 in those 10 games with an average final score of 231 203 baltimore though the variance is quite high with a few blowouts both ways

in addition to try to account for the super bowl hangover i looked at the record of the teams coming into their game with the ravens some teams fell off after their championship win 0609 steelers while others rebounded strongly and contended again 04 patriots 07 colts 10 saints and last years patriots all in all the average winning percentage of the defending champs going into their game with us was 696 or about the equivalent of an 115 team the variance was much lower in this number as the vast majority of teams were at least decenttopretty good

then i decided to do the same for all teams during two timespans from 1996present since the ravens have existed and 2002present since realignment aka the entire existence of the texans for the ravens this did not matter since their first game against a sb champ came in 2004 but it did have a bigger effect on other teams

team records vs defending champs 1996 2002present

as seen above no matter which time period you look at the ravens are the 3rd best team in the nfl in playing against defending champs in each case behind new england and kansas city whose pre2002 numbers are helped by a sweep of the woeful postelway 99 broncos who ended up 610 as you can see most teams did play a high level of competition though with only the saints facing a losingrecord defending champion on average most hovered around the 115 124 range exactly on par with baltimores opponents

we also see a level of dominance by the afc with the best six records against champs coming from our conference this is partly due to an edge to afc super bowl champions in this time period 1510 and therefore more opportunity to pick up wins for teams in their conference and while the usual suspects like the lions jets redskins and cardinals are near the bottom there are also some interestingly good teams there speaking to their relatively recent risereturn to prominence like the 49ers and texans

so what does all this mean for monday night absolutely nothing these stats are of course completely meaningless just like the lamars history in primetime games or mahomes record against us however they were fun to put together and hopefully are of interest to someone and to go back to that 2010 saints game for just a moment that was a game in baltimore against a highflying passing offense led by a quarterback who had just won super bowl mvp meanwhile the ravens ground game was led by smaller powerful running back who wore 27 and caught balls out of the backfield and our defensive lineman wearing 93 was swatting down and intercepting balls at the line of scrimmage coincidence well yes obviously but also maybe not



tldr ravens record re returning ringreceivers resplendent ranked right in rear of recent rivals

nate burleson is the truth he calls it as he sees it this was a great analysis of lamars spectacular anticipation on his throws leading his receivers to an area where he is going to throw the ball and not vice versa that is the hallmark of the really great pocket passing qbs this reminds me of the time when mj added the fadeaway jumper to his repertoire and became unstoppable
i loved every second of the gif war both sides were unbelievably entertaining we won clearly and i hope it never stops

week 2 game preview youre a little late on this one
buddy
im honestly nervous af about averret if he keeps getting smoked we will definitely lose for sure
such freezing cold takes as if lamar loses monday at age 23 theres no practical way he will ever even his career record against mahomes or focusing on how the chiefs havent given up many qb rushing yards in 2 games but ignoring completely that they have been gashed in total rushing yards smh do better


the jaleel sign got me lol
this is my favorite one yet nice work
chiefs fans bunch of jabronis
i was enjoying this from the beginning but that lamar sign put me into fits
is it monday yet god damn the build up
paul rudd clapping for us is another nice touch lmao
history books will speak if the great gif war of 2020

jokes aside i hate what the wwe did to booker t lol

man i woke up today sad as hell
rooting hard for you guys tomorrow night
you could always just wake up now and stay awake through the entirety of sunday and monday
got jj watts new shoes on cheering the texans on today
ugh wife even dressed our 6month daughter in one of her new ravens onesies only to have me remind her we play tomorrow night at least theres a second one for her to wear to bed
i might have had too much alcohol but does four monday or thursday games feel like a lot to anyone else
the nfl realized the ravens deserved to have their own day of football and didnt wanna put them on the same day as the shit browns tie bengals and overrated bath towels


to the town of kansas city rode a raven one fine day

hardly spoke to fans around him didnt have too much to say

no one dared to ask statistics no one dared insult his drip

the raven there among them had lamarvelous on his hip



edit can anyone spot the qb sneak
where are those titans at
surly mahomes surly mahomes
my only complaint is the browns who we faced first didnt take the first bullet
while i may have hatred loathing and contempt for the ravens i have the opposite for this gif


also i dont have those for the ravens respect and a tiny amount of fear
this was fantastic to watch thank you d
lol the score in the blood got me and the logo in the smoke nice work
i love it but the ravens dude gets killed at the end of this short film

if i could upvote wet hot american summer 2x i would
this makes me happy and sad at the same time

this is a great idea thank you

thanks
fox45 wash cleveland 100 cbs texans pittsburgh 100 fox dallas seattle 430

people seriously think butker is the best lol
the thing about kickers is you cant really dethrone the best they have to dethrone themselves by missing tucker is the best period butker is top 5 but wont be the best until tucker retires or starts missing
still fuckin got it
haha love it truth is these are the two best kickers in the league but tucker is far and away the best

fuck the squealers
wouldnt it be great if pittsburgh and cleveland both lost today yaaaaaa
rooting for texans so steelers get no where close to the division

low key rooting for cleveland so baker can stay there for a few more 88atbest seasons
lets go texans
goddamn it houston
they fucking blew it
it feels good to have gotten the win against houston out of the way because i really like them its fun to root for them oh and fuck the steelers
lets goooo texans
the early games went about as bad for us as possible
since im not watching football until tomorrow night today i can be a texans fan ram those longhorns up their asses
fuck em
god damn houston just fell apart in the second half
clap clap clapclapclap
fuck the browns
fuck the steelers
fuck the bengals
go hurst
tired of watching all these sad franchises piss away leads against our division rivals texans eagles redskins or whatever the fuck theyre calling themselves now
lmao washington and houston just straight up shit the bed when they had a chance to put away the afc north teams nobody is going to save us we gotta do it by ourselvesagain
and the rams choke one away too cant even get the satisfaction of a bills loss today

and the titans are about to complete their comeback too today was just full of annoying games
i realize this isnt football related but im gonna say it anyway

please vote in the upcoming election

not just for the presidency but for the local and state elections too

the local people probably affect our life more than the president
lets go wft texans and vikings
football team producing
its pretty funny though that tj watts hit on the watson interception was basically the same as earl thomas hit on rudolph last year which steeler fans thought was the dirtiest hit of all time but none see anything wrong with it this time around
holy shit the eagles are about to tie the bengals again

i wonder if carson knew that could happen
is villenueavo actually good or is he just a great story player cause of the military background
texans up 143 on the steelers so much for that scary defense
imagine not having a goat kicker have these other kickers tried not missing
steelers have given up more in the 1st half that the ravens did last week against the texans
wow of course in a important ass week the browns and steelers get fucking gimmies and we get the the super bowl champs tomorrow is a must win game theres no excuses if we lose a 3rd time to the chiefs in 3 years i really hope we blow them out
haskins is not very good
its so frustrating watching nfc east teams suck against our division rivals lol
never ever get help man
steelers have only won in one score games against teams that are combined 08 and likely to be 09 after today theyve barely snuck out wins against trash teams but im sure if we lose tomorrow nflcom will have pitt ranked 2 behind the chiefs

browns are over 500 for the first time in 6 years by barely beating the 021 bengals and only winning by 2 scores after being 5 in turnovers against the wft

bengals are 021 losing to tyrod taylor and a missed field goal losing to the browns while burrow was pummeled or running for his life the entire game and just tied against the 021 eagles

raiders decided they are who we thought they are and wont end up really competing for the division against kc chiefs gonna cakewalk through their division and will probably lock up their playoff spot by week 10

fuck our purple bros for choking away the titans game

im not upset about the bills winning because it keeps the pats in second place in that trash ass division

i really hope we beat the chiefs because this year seems like the year that every team is gonna shit the bed to the steelers this year
texans exposing this sorry ass 20 steelers team they barely beat the giants and the jeff driskal broncos look what happens when they play a real team fuck the rapist
in jedem spiel ob ball ob kegel

ist einer der die steelers vgelt

und ist das spiel auch noch so klein

die steelers solln gevgelt sein
texans up two possessions early in the second
lol clowney

texans have scored more in 1 half against pittsburgh than they did in each of their previous games
texans may have killed themselves with that pick
refs handed the bills a dub smh
im so sick of teams in this division tying lmao
atlanta choked again

the shitstains and shitsburgh both won their games

bills came back

not liking the outcomes of these games as it pertains to us
bears 45

pats 60

steelers 55

packers 25

go packers go and im 200 richer
kinda mad that if we lose this tough game well be the only afc north team to lose this week
watson with the td
now that the ravens are an officially hyped teamtm these bills are filling in the underrated buzzsaw niche pretty nicely
this is my first time really watching haskins yikes
cmon texans do it for the guys that beat your ass last weekend

this would be better if last year was their first super bowl win
i made this on my phone so forgive the shittiness
when you have to explain it so many times youve got a problem

im just flipping back and forth between the two both have been kinda underwhelming except washingtons scoring drive
red zone is a powerful thing
those no namers are keeping to close with cleveland i figured hou vs shit would be close but i thought this would be 1 of those big games from cleveland
im really disappointed in haskins washington could be winning if he was a starting caliber nfl qb
browns and bengals winning against teams we have yet to play cant wait to see what we do the wfteagles
i started nich chubb and wft defense in fantasy i shouldve realized that if one of them does good the other does shit but im too much of an idiot

looks identical to ours when they opposition makes their first play of the day
game threads in general are toxic af we had some in ours lasts game acting like this when we didnt score on every possession
yeah this is literally exactly what our thread looks like the second anything goes even remotely wrong

we have been absolutely spoiled with how rarely things go wrong for us in games so people get even bitchier when things go bad
of fucking course the week we have to play the super bowl champs with patrick mahomes looking like hes never going to look human our whole division gets a w no one ever does us any favors
to be fair their secondary is spectacularly average
i mean thats how every game thread ever is their defense is elite but no they dont play like the best d in the league on every down thats impossible
lmfao

that interviewer was so thrown off lmao
lamar has the perfect balance between cold blooded and humble and i cant get over that hes ours
nah
lamar is the man
i really like this kid lmao too cold that whole interview was kinda awkward
lamar too real
riddick knew it was hilarious as soon as lamar said it lol
bruh his face as he says nah
thats my qbrbwrroman general

i cant stop watching this lamar clip

dont forget louis riddick was next to polian when he declared lamar had to move to wr in fact riddick was nodding brisk approval at the proposition after that nah the sheepish laugh was so fun to watch lamar made this line of questioning so stupid on national tv
my game is my game lamarlow stanfield
this is great does anyone have a gif of this
nah
depending on how the broncos play today the teams the steelers beat could either be 09 combined or 18 combined all 3 being rather close games
a win is a win dont matter if you play the worst teams or the best this is the nfl you try to win as much as possible because this isnt like the nba where u can load manage for 5 months and still win a championship because the better teams always win tomorrow is probably the most important game of the season for us must win no excuses were at full strength its time for lamar and our team to shut up the narratives that we still cant get it done in important games idk if this is a legacy game for lamar but its no doubt going to be very important for seeding later on
still 3 and 0 and the ravens have a tough game tomorrow
cope
as a steelers fan i just wanna appreciate the mostly respectful thread also kudos to those of you that think we are a threat this year is gonna be fun with such a close division
lol we live in you head rent free ratbirds

daniel jones

you must mean josh allen lol yes allen has had an mvp caliber start to the season rodgers wilson as well

its wk 3 though mvps are decided in novdec
its week 3 this happens every year they throw in names that arent anywhere near mvp level of play
i mean 3 of the 4 names are actually legit mvp candidates
there are a lot of players playing at mvp caliber in 3 weeks it gets cut down as players cant keep up this level of play
welcome to the nfl happens every year but wilson is playing incredibly well
mvp shouldnt really even be a discussion 3 weeks into the season
you forgot the actual mvp right now josh allen
thoughts
i come in piece as a chiefs fan you guys are the only team that we are really worried about this year im extremely nervous for monday good luck
we are the favorites
regardless of what odds you read i have a feeling this will come down to who has the ball at the right time at the end of the game game winning fg will settle this id like to favour us slightly due to having an edge with our defence

i hope this doesnt happen but its my prediction
i wouldnt say very likely but i think of any other team in the nfl i like our odds best
5050 chance
the odds arent great but theyre in our favor
5545 ravens
were probably the only team in the league that has much of a chance
id say that this is our best shot since the lamarmahomes era started i didnt pick us last year or the year before but im taking us in this one with a convincing victory
i think the ravens have the best shot our linebackers cant tackle for if the ravens run outside they will control the game and wear out the good defenders we have will be close early ravens will have the opportunity to pull away at the end lamar could choke unlikely mahomes could destroy you more likely overall should be fun but i expect to be sad tomorrow go chiefs
im going 45 chance id give them the slight edge
i think its a lock were better were home we need it more of course any given sunday but we are better in almost every area ravens by 14
just watch the game
so how likely is it that the sun will be up on tuesday
100
i think chiefs for sure looked past the chargers and was thinking about the mnf game everyones going to bring their a game for this one itll be close

lol

where ever youre staying especially considering youre traveling shit like this is why the us is still a shit show compared to any other decent country

benders in fells if theyre open my favorite dive they dont have food but will let you order from anywhere and their drinks are dirt cheap

3431 chiefs

1 lamar 4 total tds and plays phenomenal

2 run defense is middling but sufficient

3 pass rush is lacking and mahomes leads a 10 point comeback in the 4th

sincerely hope im wrong but thats my unbiased prediction for the game
4034 ravens

dobbins is unleashed has over 100 rushing yards
lj throws his first pick but it goes along with 3 tds
deshon elliott makes some big plays on the back end
ravens 3124

ravens stop the chiefs running game early and make their offense one dimensional after getting two quick touchdowns

averett plays well jimmy smith is able to limit kelce along with help from queen

judon comes up with a strip sack on a mahomes scramble drill late in the 4th for his second sack of the game
chiefs win in a fairly high scoring game heartbreaking refs fuck us
4838 ravens sealed by a peters pick 6

1 ceh leads in yards from scrimmage with 200 but tyreek hill is kept in check all game

2 lamar reaches 400 total yards and 4 tds

3 wolfe and campbell combine for 3 sacks
ravens 31
chiefs 27

judon goes crazy multiple sacks and a ton of pressure on mahomes hes been close a lot this year i think he breaks through

duvernay has his best game yet 75 yards and a td

marlon gets his hands on the football one way or another whether its a pick or a scoop or forces a fumble
ravens 3427

mahomes rushes for more yards than jackson bold i know

2 picks against mahomes

fumble by either jackson or ingram
2723 ravens win

1 both teams defenses step up and make this a lower scoring game than is being predicted there will be flashy plays but not crazy scoring

2 lamar will throw 3 td passes all to different wrs

3 ceh runs all over our defense and mahomes will make plays with his legs as well the secondary will clamp down however and limit the passing totals i say the chiefs will run for over 100 yards but throw for less than 250


one of my favorite movies rip john wish you were still with us
yesssss
lmao thats a great use of a hilarious scene
this is awesome i was lmao

hope our game is as good as this packerssaints game much respect

go chiefs

god bless whoever made this
this made me more happy at 4am then it should have props to you 3

legendary
noice even better than slice and dice
nice try maybe we will see you in january

gonna need source on that baby commercial seems like its funny
removed
i would rather be 30 against terrible teams than 03 against elite teams
i remember what happened to the undefeated patriots last year when they finally played a good team
i mean who really thought they were going to go 03 playing the giants broncos and texans i would also expect them to go 30 during that stretch lets see what they look like facing a real team

theyve all been narrow wins too they have yet to have a convincing win but that could just be because tomlin always seems to get his players to play down to inferior competition
narrow wins against one incredibly bad team one pretty bad team and one good not great team thats better than their record they look good but beatable
theyre obviously not a great team but theyll still be a tough out for the browns and obviously us as long as ben is breathing and taking snaps for them ill consider them a threat
news flash the steelers are overrated lol
steelers still got it offensively id say top 15 thats all they need to be dangerous their defense is legit too

with that said fuck the steelerss
looks like another year of stomach pains watching zadarius smith define a defense and make big plays on the pass rush
way better than judon smh
my guy im a milwaukee native living in baldimore currently these past couple years have been ridiculously fun football for me watching the pack and the flock z is amazing alongside preston smith and gary but you guys are super set with judon and queen
any chance suggs is waiting to see who is a contender and needs a pass rusher he hasnt officially retired yet
its ok we can watch him choke in the 2nd round or nfccg this year because packers are choke artist

bandwagon much
bus is full
nah you should have jumped back on last year this gus bus is full
if youre only with teams when theyre doing well then by my definition youre not a fan not hating on you but i must say after going through the rough years these years feel so much better

i just like the duck
he got matsui
bonus points for sierra nevada
you do know hes a kc fan for real though right

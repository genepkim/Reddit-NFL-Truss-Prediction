yeah his name is josh dobbs however mason was probably told to make sure we dont get out of field goal range especially with how slow they got back to the line to run the one play around 25 seconds the plan was to get a field goal and get to the locker room it wasnt a pretty couple of plays but nothing to lose sleep over
yeah take the guy who hasnt played in 3 years got benched twice for blaine gabbert the last time he played and walked out on his team with over a year left on his contract
no
jesus christ no legit should be able to bann people who suggest kaep at this point
no
no
were cash strapped

were not looking to add veteran qbs seeking real money

were not looking for an heir apparent to ben whos also in his 30s and hasnt been in the league for years meaning he wont be ready to go right away

were not looking to add anyone who comes with bakedin locker room distraction

so no even if hes better than any backup we currently have and nobody has any idea at this point whether thats the case except for his arm strength hes simply not a fit
fitzmagic would be the best option then we could have ben and fitz as our elder beard boys that being said no wont happen and we dont need anyone right now
a decision i would have supported two years ago but no
even if you want to pretend like hes not a divisive stick of dynamite who has no interest in playing football you still cant see that hes and underwhelming mobile quarterback whos play style doesnt fit our scheme and got himself benched for blaine gabbert you think thats better than a young backup whos been in our system for 3 years

i swear to god were 80 and morons will still hunt for the same reasons to make the same arguments over and over embarrassing

the four players include quarterback ben roethlisberger offensive lineman jerald hawkins running back jaylen samuels and linebacker vince williams all will be isolated for five days and are not permitted in the upmc rooney sports complex

the players will need to pass covid19 tests throughout the week before they before they are potentially eligible to play against the cincinnati bengals one sunday the players are permitted to take part in virtual meetings

the team placed tight end vance mcdonald on the reservecovid19 list on monday evening

depends on the cases if they are one the close contact list including today their 5 day period would end on saturday and will be able to play on sunday a prime example of this would be matthew stafford from last week
everyone remain calm we are 80 and we dont even know if they truly have it yet half the ravens d was put on the covid list last week and most ended up playing
so the nfl is going to give us a bye week like they gave the titans right s
this doesnt mean theyre all out right just that they had close contact with mcdonald and need to test negative to be off the list
josh dobbs mason rudolph
its only tuesday but ive already turned off sundays game
with the steelers luck jaylen samuels will be the only one to clear protocol
fuck you baltimore we know it was you


players who test positive are split into asymptomatic and symptomatic categories per packers wire theres a long list of requirements for both of those types of positive tests in order to return here for example are the details for symptomatic players in order to return

10 days have passed since first covid19 symptoms appeared

at least 72 hours have passed since symptoms last occurred

return is approved by teams physician after consulting with ics and nfls chief medical officer

local regulations and requirements are satisfied

players who are in close contact but who test negative need a second negative within 24 hours of their first negative increased symptom monitoring and eight days of daily testing
ugh plz no rudolph
they were put on the list for close contacts ravens had 8 close contacts to marlon last week and all 8 were cleared to play
can they still join the meetings through zoom in case they can play
welp gg bengals
god damn fucking fucks everybody else gets their fucking schedule reshuffled and we take it up the ass same as it ever was
guys we beat the bengals twice last year without big ben one of those times was a blowout i think we will be fine considering the game is on sunday so there is a chance that they can come back
this should not come as a any surprise considering the state of the entire country my thoughts are with the coaches players and their families i hope they all have speedy recoveries and no ill effects of this terrible virus we still dont know the short and long term effects of this virus there is nothing more important in life than good health
steeler strong
i fucking hate my life
so do we get a bye now like the titans and everyone needs to move their schedule around to accommodate us
s
how she goes
heres a question heath miller used to be bens roommate on the road trips is vance bens roommate now since heaths been gone do they even still have roommates with covid
as shitty as this is id rather it go around the team now than in january
nooooooooooooo
fuck
shit
oh
well we might get our midseason bye back now
well if were gonna lose a game now is the time
screw you marlon humphrey
not good not good at all fucking reindeer time boys

edit if bince is out the avery trade was clairvoyant let me tell ya
i see weve decided to switch to expert mode
were doomed
obviouslynot great news id like to point out that matthew stafford went on the covid19 list on likethursday and was cleared to play by sunday hopefully these guys are simply on the list for precautionary purposes due to contact tracing and that they test negative for covid

basicallydont panic at least not yet
bro what the fuck what the fuck bro
this is fine
mother fucker
quick does anyone have charlie batchs cell phone number
fuck the ravens and fuck the titans
if you havent been worried about this since week 1 you havent been paying attention
well fuck
hahahaha fuck
fade me fam
f
fuck
pain
this same exact situation happened to the lions last week and stafford was able to play sunday hope everything comes back negative
well this could be pretty fucking bad no ben and vince against even the jags would make the trap game into a suckfest game
mason rudolph gonna give us our first loss of the year
one more thing about the loss of big ben the steelers need to go out and bring in a more capable backup than what they have now we all saw it last year and if it happens again the steelers could end up 88 again there is absolutely no reason for the steelers not to sign colin kaepernick if you dont like his political stance tough shit the guys a baller i happen to believe in colins cause but i also believe the guy is a gifted qb i know there are haters out there but i say suck it up for the good of the team the guys a proven winner and the best chance for the steelers if ben goes down come on rooneys my entire life i have seen the steelers do the right thing by people and the organization set the tone and do the right thing
i will not reply to haters as it is no use trying to educate the ignorant but i will respect your view as long as it is not just calling others vile names or shouting racist rhetoric
steeler strong
we do not care

next man up bengals week about to be 90 esskeeettiittt
rip
lets see what a rocket scientist can do to some big fat cats
trade for fitzmagic plz
that meme of us being 80 and with mason standing in the background looking 88 is giving me nightmares now

although i think ben will play
if ben doesnt get cleared i just hope jaylen does that way he can run the wild cat all game vs the bengals
just do what the dodgers did say they dont have covid and then in the 4th quarter with about 2 mins to go say you got the more definitive test back and then take them out
covid would be the thing to ruin our perfect season
ben is surprising hes been extra cautious
we should hopefully be fine

as long as he doesnt test positive between now and sunday he can play sunday given the 5 day requirement
were fucked
honestly id rather they just sit out and have a bye week i dont like the stigma of being the only unbeaten team left and getting every teams 110 effort every week we have a 001 chance of going undefeated anyways
im so sick of covid
dont play rudolph again had my vietnam flashbacks lastweek
even if he doesnt have covidben should be rested this week no need to run him out when we dont have to

we need to know what this means if just close contact w other personnel that tested positive or an actual positive test for them does anybody know this is fucking terrible

edit espn article just says they are highrisk so hopefully they test negative
i am going to pass away
quack

jk
lads its cincinnati
81 incoming shoot
shoutout to everyone who downvoted me for saying the steelers should have benched vance letting him playtravel with the team even after he was too ill to even practice on friday was an extremely stupid risk
remember when everyone was rock hard on rudolph when he threw a td to end the half against miami but in reality it was a 4 yard pass that johnson took all the way with blockers downfield

well lets all hope ben and bince are good to go
they obviously havent tested positive or that would be their status so they are likely to be ready to suit up for the game last week they did all the meetings via zoom so this wont be new for them
i am in so much pain
looks like ben has to isolate for 5 days if we include today he should be free by sundays game and i would presume needs to pass testing i am assuming he wont be at practice and will have to do everything virtually i am wondering if these gives the steelers a reason to sit ben for a week to heal those knees my only concern outside of a clean bill of health for ben and the team as this is just sport is that our whole offense has been predicated on ben we have very little run game
heard joe montana is still in good shape lately
when i read we have placed qb ben roethilisberger i immediately had a heart attack on the same level as watching our past two games thinking it was ir
im not surviving this season
good way to keep ben off the injury report this week
story on the trib says it was vance mcdonald who tested positive the ones on this list were just close contacts so just following nfl protocols
somehow i feel like this is the titans or ravens fault lol

edit jokes aside im not terribly surprised as football has easily 2 times as many people as any other sport that played and being in a bubble was not going to work for a full nfl season
hell if these guys all take a week of rest and we enter the following week a mere 81 with a couple veteran leaders from each unit having gotten a nice solid week of rest that wont be the worst thing in the world and of course we may well win anyway

hopefully vance will remain the only positive and hopefully all positives are both mildasymptomatic and free of any long term consequences and those two things do not necessarily go hand in hand with this disease

for now not worried though i question the organizational policies that allow anyone feeling unwell to have any contact or god forbid actually practice and play no matter what their covid test says this disease is too tricky our testing is too uncertain and this environment is too risky err on the side of caution and then be a whole lot more cautious than that should be every teams policy

weve got a one game cushion on the entire leauge giving vance a week of rest at home time starting the second he says hes a little under the weather wouldve kept the whole organization a lot safer and wouldnt have made any real difference in our attempt at a sb run
we have tickets to this game too
grrr
season was fun boys i cannot make myself watch rudolph on sunday
this is just the start we dont know who else is going to get it id be surprised if there arent more
panic aside lets get a real developmental qb sometime soon trade for haskins or darnold or lock if you dont like whos in the draft
it was honestly painful just to watch rudolph play those few snaps on sunday please god dont let this happen
the worst part is that samuels has been the teams second best option under center versus cincy
wouldnt it goddamn figure just past the halfway point in the best season that i can remember in my 43 years alive for the steelers then this happens wow what are the odds

to clarify though i am certainly not one of those covid 19 deniers this disease is very real my father got it over the summer and thankfully recovered my best wishes to these players and anyone else who contracts this disease do whatever is necessary to heal and stop the spread mask up people consolidate and minimize your trips out of the house lets do what we can to get rid of this thing and go back to as close to normal as we can

steps down off soap box drops mic

it just saddens me to see my favorite teams recordseason being jeopardized by something non football related
if ben plays or not they need to stop playing down to weaker opponents they always lose to at least one team they shouldnt
please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this weeks opponent including weaknesses strengths or info on lesserknown players you think will have an impact

if you are a fan of the opposing team feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above andor ask us about the steelers
want to solve the housing issue make everyone a steelers fan we live rentfree in cinci
expect your d line to have a field day before our bye we were playing an allbackup ol that is weak even when we have starters were on like our 4th maybe 5th rg of the season due to poor play and injury our own d line has also been anemic due to old age and injury so ben will have time to throw against a secondary that can play well but is inconsistent due to the lack of pressure and a young group of lbs who play well but have no true allstars

burrow is very good were just happy to see him improve each week and hopefully he plays like he did last week and not vs the ravens but the trenches will be the reason you win
what have i learned d stops run not pass o can give you 26 pts a game yet will somehow find a way to win we had success v lamar because hes a duel threat and d took away his choice made him either have to throw or run bengals will be bigtime trouble they will know to protect burrow and let his receivers work gonna see max protect and 3 wr sets
no ones going to say something here is the bengals run any good if its not then we can win this game
i was wondering how the steelers secondary has played this season other than haden and fitzpatrick can us bengals hope to exploit a weakness since wr is our biggest position of strength im expecting a ton of pressure on burrow from the elite front 7 and our weak offensive line
im weird because i like all of our afcn rivals to varying degrees including the bensgals

like we all represent the same division so i hope they do well when they arent playing us

anyway the bengals are better than their record and we often have issues with inexperienced qbs for one reason or another

this is either a steelers blowout over cinci because we come in angry or i think jb pulls it out
our best ol is our 3rd down running back i want to believe but this should be a loss just dont injure our savior please
were going to be on fox two afc teams that seems strange
so are we going to miss the start of this game because the brownstexans game had a delay
the bengals are obviously better than the cowboys team we just played its incredibly sad how close that game was last week if we play like that expect a 2 score loss to an actual competent qb like burrow our secondary needs to figure its shit out and fast
close contact isnt a full two week quaratine right both of us have players that went on covid list but is there any chance we will have all of the back
the bungles arrow is pointing up but just dont have enough horses to get the job done versus the stillers i expect burrow will get abused more than hes used to and hes used to a lot with their banged up line v butlers pressures i expect lots of man or creeping zones to stop the bungle short passing game burrow is decent at extending plays for a rookie and bud will have to pop him a good one to make him think twicemake bad decisions
kind of interested in seeing burrow not that i want him to torch us but he is much better than the record says dude is a beast
i honestly think we need to find a qb in the next two or so years good enough to compete with burrow not worried about lamar or baker for the long term but burrow is going to be a problem for years if we cant find someone better than mason rudolph to compete against him
you silly gooses i see what your trying to do get inside knowledge to give tomlin i wont let it happen
burrow is much better than his record indicates and our entire secondary needs to show up this game because he can extend plays and score 45 of their losses were within 1 td and if our defense plays like they did in dallas they might be our first l
idk why but i feel like were about to clap the bengals how we did the browns coming off a close win against an nfc east opponent we were supposed to beat handily to play an ohio divisional rival i also think the last three weeks will ensure that we try our best to not pay down even if we dont blow them out itll still probably be a two score game
its more of a tossup than id like but i think weve got this were finally back home we rarely if ever play down to our rivals and burrow has been taking hits all season which means our d will hopefully not be any different

even if we lose we were still the last unbeaten team which is what i had hoped for when the herd started thinning everything after that has been a victory lap
please use this thread to post any trash talk about next weeks opponent some people from their sub may come here to do the same so please

do not downvote visitors for using this post correctly its a trash talk thread
lol what could the bengals fans even say ooo the cowboys almost beat you we beat the titans better than you did actually wait are the bengals gonna win this game
ya but what if we beat you tho
mike tomlin has 25 wins against the bengals the bengals have 16 wins against the steelers since 1990
i hate all of you but i hope nobody gets hurt
the bengals playoff win drought is old enough to vote
bens actually just taking a week off because he got tired of beating cincys ass
bah gawd thats mason rudolphs music
not feeling like trash talking with the news that just dropped
why is everything  in a trash talk thread
tj isnt gonna get held every other passing down this week
bengals more like bungals please laugh
um hi
those striped uniforms are the ugliest things ever created there i said it at least when we lose in our white tiger jerseys it looks good lol
big ben could miss the game on the covid list and wed still win
dont hurt joe i havent enjoyed football in years please not again
everybody who was talking the most about why the fo didnt select jalen hurts as backup qb rd 2 suddenly silent now claypool is balling out and were 80
cinci is about to be 02 against mason rudolph and i love it
big ben hurts both of his knees and wakes up sick i imagine it is just a sore throat and maybe some lock jaw though
chili on spaghetti and hotdogs fries on sammies
the nfl should have 31 teams the bengals are basically a bad quota hire
the steelers qb assaulted a woman
gl guys dont you dare hurt joe burrow
bungles gonna bungle
leave it to the yinzers to invite us to a trash talk thread then downvote us and delete our comments

i wish your team was as soft as your fan base
skyline chili is disgusting
lol you censor people trash talking your gb sad
the immaculate reception shouldnt have been a legal reception





i just posted this as well hoping its just precautionary

i mean why the hell would we send vance on that plane two days after he was sick negative test or not it was stupid
probably wasnt gonna practice much this week anyways
rudolph cant show up before thanksgiving wait until christmas

all he needs is another injection of gamer juice and hell be ready for gameday
time to be worried all week
well ben couldntve started any slower than we did this past week so rest them knees big guy
probably get a saturday walk through and play sunday brutal but it is what it is
dont play him at all this week regardless this is a marathon not a sprint both knees hurt let him sit plus we can flex on the bungles just cause
just give him the week off let dobbs work with the first team and start him rudolph is a liability if we lose we lose bengals will think they did something special and well know they beat the jv squad plus if will get that undefeated weight off their shoulders so they can go out and play
so just like literally any other player why not just quarantine him instead of putting him on the list




just hearing mason rudolph makes me cringe
he tested negative
welp being undefeated was fun while it lasted
i cant watch mason rudolph since i noticed his chinstrap looks like a tiny pair of tightie whitie underwear on his chin
all i hear is a little much needed rest for a 38 yo qb with a two game cushion in the division

negative tests mean he should be able to play sunday so i guess it aint all bad
fingers crossed he can play this weekend luckily for mason we dont play the other ohio team this week if he cant

i need josh dobbs at practice all week get mason away from my steelers

look i get mason isnt very good but why are people here so high on dobbs he is 612 43 yards and an interception for his career he literally got beat out by mason in the preseason last year he wasnt even good enough to make the jags roster i truly dont understand it
worst thing that happens is bens knees get a week to rest we lose and our record plummets to 81
man today is just going to roller coaster of emotions isnt it
this is great news i was worried after our fine was the same as the titans for tomlin and other coaches on the sideline not masking up good on benny
whats your excuse vance

hes a little guy like ryan switzer harmless damn lmao

edit rayray is a beast and johnson too but lets preserve johnson such upgrades over switzer in the return game fun to watch this year
so true about that stupid stadium design lets have the sun shine right in the quarterbacks eyes when its time to play
the common core math comment absolutely murdered me lmao
threetwoone thank god

that was all of us
jerry jones looks like skeletor at a mens warehouse had me dying
something about him he looks like he only sleeps on couches

lmao this was a great episode
you know the stillers always play down to competition been saying that to everyone who said that game was going to be ezpz

shaking more than the noahs ark floorboards mood for every stiller game
love the kennywood reference at the beginning
i pretty much verbalized what he was saying at 011 and 120 this is why i love this its almost like im watching myself watch the game
the tony romo report had me dying hahahaha

view poll
i would say 2 sacks this time because burrow can be pretty mobile
superior always 5 grf
im going with 56
to infinity and beyond
bro i was so disappointed by the sack numbers this past weekend
0 with how holding is no longer a call
nineteen
logic would say this is a 23 week but we are the steelers who apparently give zero shits for logic so ill go with 5

now she must wear it each week

i have one for my girl as well and its part of the pregame warmup
i put my jersey on grab my terrible towel my hat then i put her jersey on her

congrats she looks great

go steelers
wirehair pointing griffon ive got two pudelpointers that look an awful lot like her
will upvote anything with a dog cute pup

mystery solved on how mcdonald got covid lol
coronavirus am i a joke to you
truly amazing venue was lucky or unlucky enough to go to superbowl 45 there food was fantastic too only gripe was there isnt jack shit to do in the area outside the stadium its just parking lot as far as the eye can see and texas rangers stadium
nice pics that stadium is really impressive really wanna make it down sometime

no doubt the cowboys fans can fill their own stadium when times are good i wonder how many of our fans would still show up if we were 25 and down to our 4th string qb steelers havent been below 6 wins since the year bradshaw was drafted

edit i stand corrected we got 5 in 1988 knolls last few seasons before cowher were the worst since 72 and we were still not terrible moral of the story even in off years its pretty good to be a steelers fan
nice social distancing bro
this is really shocking to see it seems reasonable to have social distancing and 25 capacity in the stands but i just cant even comprehend how that area pictured doesnt have any covid regulations in place is that inside the stadium this is criminally negligent

im from canada are scenes like this normal outside of texas in america

screen run short quick pass

run run quick slant

run quick slant quick slant

screen pass screen pass run


thats what we will see all game long with mason
can anybody sell me on why i should be optimistic about mason maybe starting a game
watch his ass go off for like 5 touchdowns and 500 yards passing lmao
removed
needs a dent in the bathelmet
fuck this shit ben will test negative and will play saturday dont even put this shit out into the universe
unpopular opinion i love bvs

hes like ryan switzer except he actually does shit hes like max level ryan switzer lmao
great player

what i dont appreciate though is that stupid sun glare the cowboys use to gain an advantage
i got this picture from the steelers official app and seriously this kid is crazy i have also decided to do this weekly who do you think is unappreciated or underated edit i found this highlight reel of the season for rayray and it shows how good he is when he can pick up speed highlight reel
hes going to break a return for a td and soon
i give big credit to rayray as a guy who watched basically every snap of his entire college career i expected him to be a camp body and overall failure due his dropsfumbles problems that plagued him his entire career at clemson im glad to see hes figured that out and his talent is showing with the ball in his hands
he has been immense
it is very nice finally having a legit return guy
did pretty damn good especially with that stupid stadium design allowing blinding sunlight in
brought to you by miller lite tastes great less filling
such a badass pic
him and boz solo carried special teams
gives me randle el vibes
i love fearless players like mr mccloud everytime he touches the ball hes like a keg of dynamite with sparks flying around it boom hes gone
my favorite part is that he isnt switzer my 2nd favorite part is he isnt switzer
should have kept switzer
big fuck you to everyone i argued about switzer with lol idk why yall wanted to believe he was good so badly
thank god we cut switzer for him been waiting 2 years for that
dudes actually nice at returns
crazy to think that i picked him up in a madden franchise for his speed 2 months later steelers sign the same guy really loving him as a return man
we need to replace those glaring lite beer signs with iron city beer ones
keep killing it on special teams ray ray
only thing i liked switzer for was his reliable hands and ray ray does that doesnt get knocked over by a gust of wind and is actually fast
thats a great pic can you imagine standing in his shoes waiting for the kick awesome
proud of my boy since we were young the boy got talent
miller life
i miss ryan switzer not
dude is playing hard would love to see him and mcfarland get some more snaps
eagle fan here but also a die hard clemson fan and always loved rayray despite his drops from time to time i am glad he has found a team that uses him properly and hope he continues to improve as a receiver as well good luck rest of season
glad hes doing well i remember him getting on my ever lasting nerves as a kick returner and wr at clemson
i could go for a miller right about now
looks like a miller lite ad
dope picture
is mccloud related to the highlander
the stupidest designed stadium in existence
thanks for giving everyone covid
did i miss something what did ray ray do on sunday besides foolishly returning a kickoff from 4 yards deep into the endzone

we gotta pull fieler for dotson asap
ravens lived in the backfield which was to be expected as they have a very good blitz package and talent up front i was concerned by the cowboys and how they were able to collapse the pocket and completely stuff runs as well truth be told we have some older lineman and new guys rotating in hopefully it gets sorted out down the stretch but this isnt the 20142017 oline ben has been getting rid of the ball around 2 seconds for a reason
said it in another thread but the line as a unit has been unstable all year these numbers have fallen a little bit for the steelers but the steelers offensive line has been below average no matter how you slice it

short fields provided by the defense and special teams and the quick passing game has helped them to put up points but defenses have already begun to squat on some of the underneath stuff and the run if the offensive line cant do its job well enough to cut through that or cant protect long enough for roethlisberger to push the ball down the field the offense may run into some problems
it feels like decastro has heavily regressed
the munchak magic is wearing off
probably has to do with running 5 wide oline does a good job keeping ben clean we are like 4th fewest sacks allowed in the league
call me crazy but i dont think the bengals texans jets broncos vikings giants cowboys washington seahawks and chargers have a better oline than us
i think our guys are tired tennessee baltimore was two tough games in a row would have been nice to have a bye week later in the year
love the idea of dotson rotating in more to get guys a breather pouncy and decastro are both playing less than 100
offense win rates through week 9 up and right are good is good are good

theyre just not a good unit dotson should be in and im not sold on okorafor yet
it doesnt feel that bad but i guess it is thats a bit concerning but oh well
lol 80 scoring 25 points per game you dont do that with a shit line analytics in football is mostly a joke outside of tendency charts which have been around forever subjective analysis pretending to be objective bunch of nerds faking relevancy unlike baseball its not that hard to watch every rep of every game in a season which naturally folds in to a sample size problem
having said that this might be pounceys worst season and decastro hasnt been himself so far but that doesnt mean they suck either

villanueva is the answer to our pass blocking being bad hes becoming a liability

dont come at my guys neck like that
juju mason is that drool

mason yeah i forgot to swallow
anyone have landry eagle chest jones number
please dont toy with our emotions like that we fans go through enough during the game
whats this from
if he starts anyone think this is his last chance
more like mason rudoofy amirite

no i hope he can do good things in the future wherever he is
lmfao its too real
not funny


as a person of color i feel that lmao
chase claypools social media presence is hilarious
nothing will ever top how much i love the camraderie between our guys
i just want to know what happens to receivers
i need to put the flash on

took me like 5 rewatches before i figured out what he was saying that shits funny james is a godamn natural born ninja with that much melanin and talent


honestly dont know if thats racist hopefully not
i was like man did he just throw shade on how dark skinned james is nah cant be but it seems im not the only one who thought it whew
i dont like it but oh well

by all the reports weve seen they followed the protocol to the letter unbiased doctors assigned by the nfl signed off

its easy to say they should automatically quant one sick players but there are other illnesses too and you dont just give up a competitive advantage
any sick player regardless of symptoms should be placed on the covid list and distanced from others for their own safety and others this is a massive fuckup from the team and also to the surprise of no one a massive fuckup by the leagues protocols the steelers didnt technically do anything wrong here as far as the league is concerned but i just dont see how any team is comfortable having a guy with illness being around the team
the national football league
what kind of morons are we dealing with here

looks at randy and keith
i know im not in the popular opinion here but he gets absolutely shit on throughout this subreddit for pretty unfair reasons he came in as a basically a rookie didnt touch the field year 1 with debatably the worst scenario for offense for those who have forgotten we had so many injuries on the offensive side it was nuts with all things considered he went 53 with the team heres his line against cinci last year when we won 273 and tell me honestly if you wouldnt be happy with this performance if he did it this year

2428

229 yards

2 td

0 int

8571 cmp

1246 qb rating

hes not ben roethlisberger he might not be a future qb1 hell he might not play many more seasons in the nfl but for fucks sake hes not as bad as everyone says here and hes capable of winning 1 game against one of the worst teams in the nfl were spoiled with big ben give this guy a shot now he has a year of experience and has proven he can take down easy teams in his first year he was drafted in the 3rd round and never touted by experts to be a qb1 but he was expected to be good enough to take down bad teams which he was done and which he should be able to do this weekend

on sunday if ben does not play then mason will be our qb1 and if youre a fan of the team you should cheer for him to do well and the steelers to win
ben will be off the covid list by sunday i think
i dont think he is our qb of the future but he is our backup qb currently and should have our support so if ben cant go we should all be rooting for him sunday
i honestly am starting to think that its less on mason and more on the play calling
yeah man i agree obviously the coaches see something in him
lets not cherry pick stats here his second performance against the same bungles was 816 85 yds 0 td 1 int 500 cmp a qb rating of 398 and a benching

no ones saying they dont want him to play well if it comes to that no ones saying that the defense and skill players arent good enough to carry the team to a win against cincinnati if it comes to that but at some point the just give him a chance to develop argument stops carrying weight and you just have to accept what you see is what you get
we know its you mason
agree but small nitpick that mason wasnt a rookie last year he was in his 2nd season i definitely think he gets more shit than he deserves from fans
i agree with this post rudolph is a nice kid and im not sure weve seen his true potential but the next time he gets a chance to startplay he needs to shine
regardless of who our back up is we live die with ben its been this way for 15 years
as i said on another thread this sub shits on ben and ask for his benching when he has a bad quarter that is a hof qb playing at an elite level right now and they ask for him to be benched when he throws a few incompletes imagine when they see a young backup qb

basically steeler fans like to act like they are the most football knowledgeable fans in the world but they are mostly huge dumbasses present company excluded of course
i thought he did well until getting knocked out by a dirty hit
just because hes shit and we dont want him to play doesnt mean we hate him


the standard is the standard and hes not the standard
if he suits up ill support him personally id rather see dobbs given the chance but whoever we put out there we need
im sorry but i really think mason is bad at being a winning quarterback theres something about his throwing form that i hate that throw to ebron against the cowboys was bad
and duck hodges went 16 for 19 842 cmp for 152 yards and 1 td 0 int in that one game against arizona for a passer rating of 1175 he was good enough in that game to get everyone buying duck hats

but the next 3 games showed why hes not the steelers qb of the future either that said if he ever takes the field in a steelers uniform ill certainly cheer or quack for him again because what other choice will i have
i honestly hope he plays this week we have a lot of football left this season and ben needs some rest i know a backups job is to come in cold but getting a game this season under his belt where he starts may help get the ball rolling in the right direction
i dont hate him i just hate when he plays football for the steelers
no hes trash
no
nobody hates him except maybe myles garrett

hes just a terrible quarterback and theres nothing unfair about realizing that

if he starts ill root for him to surprise me and do well if he predictably doesnt ill root for them to yank him quickly and get dobbs in there and ill then root for him

i dont expect a lot of team success without a qb but were talented up and down the roster so weve still got a chance better still it doesnt really matter if we win given our current place in the league pecking order lots of football still to be played win or lose and our position heading into the second half will be excellent no matter what the outcome
no he looks like his dad owns a dealership
no he earned the hate

now he need to earn back our respect
im with you op i think mason can win a few games ive been a fan of his since we took him i will continue to be until hes not a steeler anymore i hope he keeps developing
agreed it is so popular to hate on mason people forget he is a backup comparing him to ben is unfair i feel more comfortable with mason coming in for a few games than several of the other backups weve had over the last 15 years
mason was playing really well before he got his bell rung and became mr cautiousness and less likely to stand strong and deliver confidently in the pocket
dobbs gives you all the arm talent of mason and excels in the mobility also ben appears to have taken dobbs under his wing and relies on dobbs to tell him what he is seeing from the sideline
nah man hes trash im tired of the people bringing up 53 as if it excuses how poor he and the offense was cherrypicking one game is pointless too
you can cherry pick one games stats but he was flat out bad overall and was carried by the d even as backups go hes not even average
i didnt even read the rest of the comments because most of them are probably shit

yes mason has a laser arm and he can manage a game wtf else are you looking for in a backup qb is he supposed to come in looking like arod
peoples expectations for pittsburgh sports are dumb over reactions to everything no one is understanding hes been dealing with fichtner up until this year there was no preseason with matt canada helping him hes probably been adjusting to a lot of new things he got thrown into his first game action in the middle of a game for literally one possession and everyone is doom and gloom were undefeated and i wish hed play an entire game to give ben a week off for his knees
lets talk about the game in cincy he shit the bed and got benched hes not a starter in the nfl and hes a low tier backup
hell he wasnt even drafted after the reindeer games santa picked him up as a free agent
kk
theres not much to root for or be excited for the guy is noodle armed he cant make routine throws do we all want him to do well and want to win should he end up starting this week of course but is anyone going to be surprised if that doesnt happen i doubt it
i just want mason in there so we could hopefully get some close up shots of gene
when he plays well the hate will stop its that simple
i was just about to post something about mason hes not starter or even backup quality his stats look fine because he dumps the ball a lot the guy is timid hes missing the it factor and we need to draft someone fast bens on the tail end of his career
no

im sorry but he just doesnt even show any kind of promise imo if his first look is covered he straight up panics even when he isnt getting pressured sometimes its like he forgets his legs are able to move and sometimes he does this weird flailing thing with his shoulders and throws an awful pass

i just dont think he has it unless there is some major changes to his mechanics pocket awareness and mobility
no
he had a nice game but if u look at his body of work he is a career backup i have always been a little higher on dobbs just based on his running ability and smarts but whatever we have some wiggle room
start dobbs

also the circle is not lopsided its just the angle of the photo being taken
i suggest filling it in with clear acrylic then giving it a coal of clear acrylic to protect it from any water causing damage
looks good did you use a template
been laser engraving for a couple years now this looks mint looks almost like a 3d engrave with the varied depth

i was worried about losing after i heard the news about ben today but after this tweet i can rest assured that our defense is going to get a shut out and return at least 1 to the house all in all i feel much better now thanks cincy
to paraphrase archer

do you want to continue to be cursed because this is how you continue to be cursed
i mean i too always choose to taunt opponents with video from the season they won the championship while beating the posting team in those playoffs in a game where their young franchise qb blew out his knee such happy memories im sure
they just lost is what they just did
mason rudolph about to throw 3442 412 yards 7 tds
was this the year we won super bowl xl nice
youd think theyd learn
i swear its a legitimate curse they will not win they will not come close
this is a get right game big ben no ben bengals kick a field goal as time expires for a final score of 2710 lock it in send the bengals back the den
did the titans not warn the bungles what happens when you do something like this
curse activated
congratulations you played yourselves
so theyve chosen death
foolish
im convinced every sports fan on twitter is a clown every single fan base people just do not know what theyre talking about at all

bengals fan over there is like they cant stop the run ez game like aside from 2 outlier games were a top 3 team against the run were also literally undefeated and youre 251 how in the hell can you be so delusional to think youre gonna disrespect our towel come into our house and put up a performance that even minutely resembles that of a professional football team youd think being last in the division would humble them a little bit
the responses are awesome though duck dropping a highlight on them keisel reminding them what happened after it says a lot about their fanbase though with the responses
i did not see the terrible towel as witchcraft to hex the enemy it would be a positive force driving the steelers to superhuman performance but if it experienced a yen for mischief and created fatal mistakes by opponents i would tolerate that
the diesel replies
do they really not remember everything that happened after this
steelers d is like
oh heck no
welp looks like mason gonna dunk on em
what a sad sad franchise i would feel sorry for them but that would imply that i actually think about them
lmao ask tj houshmandzadeh how that worked out for him
remember this is the team that hasnt won a playoff game in decades because the last time they had a shot they threw it away by giving up 30 penalty yards on one play in the last drive of the game the curse of the towel is real disrespect it at your own risk
a 251 team guaranteeing a victory against an undefeated team who owns them sounds like a bunch of scared kids whistling past the graveyard to me
whats annoying about it is they did it just for traffic try hards
let them dream
steelers by 40 now
bungals are gonna bungal no wonder they havent been doing well since they did this
theyve been trash since this happened
fun fact 84 is also the average iq of bengals fans
this aged well
they dont respect the curse of bo cant expect them to respect a curse that affects them twice a year
i never want to see one of our players disrespect another team like this supposedly juju was making his way to the dallas star last week to do who knows what its totally out of line just like sean peyton dancing with his team after beating down the bucs on snf this shit is all bulletin board material and can only come back to bite you in the ass
you realize that player hasnt been in the nfl for years right they didnt just do anything

removed

view poll
if anyone thinks he should be replaced this season yall are crazy lmao cant implement an offensive system in week 10 we are 80 the world isnt on fire relax if ben calls the plays we will throw 80 of the time and have no balance
option 4 we do not need 15 posts about this a week and report for shit posting due to low effort content
i think this post is worthy of my downvote
removed


you ok
wtf are you talking bout
corps
oh you poor poor man

please delete this before anyone else can see the absolute idiocy that you took the time to write out
troll
honestly im a little disappointed in claypools production how many sideline out routes does ben have to rocket the ball straight into claypools hands before he actually catches one

it seems hes running a great route getting separation but he just cant finish the ball either goes through his hands or bounces off of his hands

i guess im just used to ab hauling those in and cant believe claypool cant

id say maybe we let johnson run those routes and let claypool run those routes across the middle but johnson couldnt catch covid if he were sleeping in the same bed as vance

this core of wrs isnt going to get us very far in the playoffs the only one who can catch is juju and maybe washington if hes all alone in the end zone

i was in the let juju walk camp and pay bud but ffs hes our only consistent wr maybe we need him more than i thought

we get leads and go 3 and out lol
well 3 of these teams have a game up on us
cant help but feel bad for atlanta so many studs on that team i dont get why they choke so hard literally all the time
we r most defensive snaps w lead most likely lmao
this team plays offense when it has to not when it wants to
looking at kcs schedule it is pretty rough they will drop at least one more game this year
i seem to remember about 5 years straight where the cheatriots won like 80 of their games via last second field goals

what did the disrespectful post say
ill fuckin benching deandre hopkins for diontae johnson after seeing the twitter post
i am truly worried we will lose to the bungals with mason at qb
yikes dont look at the replies to that tweet twitter is such a cesspool of toxicity
well cincy it was nice knowing ya

on the other hand no it wasnt fuck cincinasty cant wait for sunday
wheres the tweet

edit never mind i assumed the official handle would know better but were talking about the bengals

ravens fans calling ben a whiner when they have a harbaugh on the sidelines is embarrassing

ben had his nose broken in a baltimore game and didnt even get a flag so lil bruv needs to shut up
their weird lovehate is great you only see 2 or 3 shit talks in a row before somebody reminds them what hes done to them
ben coming out with braces on both knees and a mask on for covid

500 yards passing

our boy loves drama
they are the biggest bunch of babies its all ben hate fat fuck this whiny baby that its their fault for fucking themselves over most times we play each other with ben we beat them more often than not they can truss that

baltimores best chance at a super bowl was last year they blew it lamar jackson will be a washed up raven getting blown out by joe burrow in 5 years hope they enjoyed their 142 season which ended the same way as ours no playoff wins and watching the super bowl at home
like the one that said ben hasnt played a full season in a while
good god its clear hes not a tough sob just a whiner lmfao pure entertainment
any ravens fan lurking this post just know you can catch hands
anyone catch the latest and greatest copypasta in the comments

listen up kids you want to know who was tough the elite mfing dragon thats who is tough joe took the same hits as ben he would just go out there and play torn acl fuck you all i can line up in shotgun you didnt hear about it from joe sometimes until weeks after hed been hurt like a thigh injury that limited him for half a season remember kiko alonso knocking him out on a dirty play you probably do remember what joe said about it afterward it was an nfl play never complained and if he could help it you never even knew

if this is already one thank god theyre not that stupid it is isnt holy shit these guys are dense
i got lucky enough to meet one of my favorite steelers of all time today aaron smith lemme just say the guy looks good i mean he always a bigger guy in his playing days but holy shit he is shredded right now hes a really good guy too helped me with some tips on my squatting max
i saw casey hampton at burger king the other day i was so shocked the gut is as big as ever
saw aaron at the childrens museum once just a cool and down to earth as can be was a great steeler underrated in the league seems like a good guy too
first jersey i ever bought with my own money was aaron smith i still wear it regularly
i met dupree and santonio in chicago prior to a bears game the better story however is when my dad met mean joe at the urinals at bettis hof induction
this is where usleestaklightning tells about how they ran aaron smith of twitter
nice i havent met any steelers but i did meet steve hutchinson in a mn gym when i lived there i met larry fitzgerald as well both times i was taken aback at how much smaller they were than i imagined larry is skinny as hell and no way hes 63 as he was just a few inches taller than me and im 510
i saw aaron smith at a grocery store in squirrel hill yesterday i told him how cool it was to meet him in person but i didnt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything
he said oh like youre doing now
i was taken aback and all i could say was huh but he kept cutting me off and going huh huh huh and closing his hand shut in front of my face i walked away and continued with my shopping and i heard him chuckle as i walked off when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in his hands without paying
the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like sir you need to pay for those first at first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter
when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me i dont even think thats a word after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly
hi everyone im not sure if anyone remembers but i did a study in team subs where i tracked the approval rating of coaches to see how it changed during the year i was doing one for preseason and now its time to do my midseason update after getting all the results im going to do a big post on rnfl probably on friday

here are the preseason results if you want to see

view poll
no good should be 90 already
i mean they are 80 hes doing what he needs to do to win
so thats what were doing today


fighting
who the fuck are the two people disapproving of tomlin
see results doing better than expected
there are 4 imposters among us
16 people disapprove of tomlin
tough call at 80
the 10 people who voted disapprove are south side uber drivers ive met all of them
man him and belichick didnt get much love considering how tenured and successful theyve been compared to some others on that list

tomlin forever earned my loyalty last year when he nearly had that team in the playoffs not to say i dont lose my mind at times when were barely able to beat awful teams it balances out

whats not to approve of
i do approve going 80 is awesome and ive rarely been this excited to watch steeler football we really need to win a couple playoff games tho ideally a super bowl win but i understand how tough that is
who to are those 23 people
can we do like the democrats and make a list of everyone who voted no
tomlin is not the problem and never has been the problems are fichtner and to a lesser extent butler but hey we 80 so fuck it
i picked disapproved soley based on the dallas game not going up by 8 was stupid all of the other games i give credit to ben because most of them ended up with ben calling the shots or fitzpatrick making a play where has tomlin been

you cant shit on the coordinators and give tomlin a pass

we come out most games looking flat and unprepared
he is a really good coach but he isnt a great coach really good is probably enough to get us to the super bowl this year

i always liked tuitt because hes a beast hes a favorite of mine now what a great story and an even better person
my favorite part of these episodes is when bud finishes up stops talking and then stares at the camera for just a little bit too long kills me every time its underproduced and i love it

for all you dobbs fans out there let me let you in on a little history nick foles was jacksonvilles starter but got injured the 2 was none other than josh dobbs he played so poorly that the jaguars went with their 3rd string qb who was none other than gardner minshew so if you really want dobbs to start ask yourselves why

dude has been cut and resigned more times than anyone i can think of in recent memory
double the watt double the edmunds
not gonna lie trey edmunds is one of my favorite players on the team hope he is on the roster when we play the bills and can have three brothers in the same game again
gotta be depth if jaysam has covid
color me excited

but i was trying to start a completion for each teams fan base to donate the most to a good cause and i think us steelers fans could absolutely donate the most i know it isnt and shouldnt be a completion to donate the most but its an easy and fun way to donate to good causes all over the country so i think we should post links and vote on which cause we would like to come together on and donate to
i promise to match the first 1000 that the sub donates to the chosen cause

edit my cause of choice is for domestic violence

edit 2 and honestly even if you can only donate 1 cent to the chosen cause its more than they had before and its worth it
you keep using the word completion but i dont think you know what it means

also rnfl is not for fund raising and the mods there have zero sense of humor when it comes to breaking the rules ive been banned multiple times just for using a word they dont like

please people we need every upvote and every form of movement theres so many people right now that could use our help

we are onto cincinnati
you can say the same about our defense going to the other side of the field to celebrate a turnover when we were losing both are a little annoying but its what they do
wrs celebrate 1st downs when down 17 defenders dance after sacks when getting torched for 40 its just a part of the game
dudes making 90 million dollars to be a not very productive running back

id celebrate like that when i flushed the toilet if i was him
fuck this guy with his stupid ugly nose rings and stupid bowl eating shenanigans
this idiot tattooed feed me on his stomach took that little bit way too far
lol yep
cee dee lamb did the same thing on a first down conversation got up and got in our faces mocking us joke is on them way too early in the game for them to taunting us
haha zeke overrated af
fuck the cowboys
i dunno i have no problem with this i think id like a player who gets psyched up like this the cowboy players had good reason to be psyched and keep the positive energy flowing no matter their season stats
cowboys shouldve rolled with the hot hand in pollard more but im not complaining
bettis would do his fire walk even when he was having bad games to try to get psyched up
who cares
never sign a rb to a second contract bell did us a favor
he actually did this in the redzone the play before our oline tipped a pass attempt and minkah got a game changing interception
i never understood why he held the imaginary spoon at that angle anyway
he is my least favorite player now that ray lewis is gone
i wasted my 4th overall pick on this guy i know his situation is bad now but he was a dud even before zak got hurt

i never get tired of watching juju channeling his inner mighty mouse and putting burfict on his ass
juju literally took his soul on that block the guy was never the same player after that hit
i knew crying bengals lady would be a meme when i saw it live thank you
man just as i start to think ah burrow is pretty cool their team isnt that good whatever i watch this and my blood boils fuck cinci fuck bufirct the free agent fuck pacman i hope we beat the christ out of them
juju should not have been suspended fined or even flagged for that hit and subsequent standing over him
gotta love it
that boy is bad
i have that as my phone wallpaper
its week ten

youve got to be a lot better than 251 before you get a week named after you

first rule of going undefeated is you dont talk about going undefeated
if he tests negative hell be cleared on saturday
how they acting like we didnt beat them twice last year without ben

correct my memory please when the titans broke protocols they got a bye week and rearranged the steelers schedule right why is it ok for pittsburgh to maybe lose a starting qb and its business as usual the league shouldve applied a more consistent approach from the beginning
with bubble wrap to at least around knees and elbow
needs more structural reinforcement maybe spikes as well and garlic
say my name

big ben heisenberger
yes please
petition to not let sick people on the team plane
better hope that gas mask stays on unlike in warzone
brilliant
dont forget the bubble wrap
maybe throw in some elbow pads
who are you talking to right now who is it you think you see do you know how many wrs ive thrown to a year i mean even if i told you you wouldnt believe it do you know what would happen if i suddenly decided to stop going into work a franchise big enough that it could be listed as arguably the best in nfl goes 88 playoff chances disappears it ceases to exist without me no you clearly dont know who youre talking to so let me clue you in i am not in danger afcn i am the danger a qb throws the ball and gets picked and you think that of me no i am the one who who throws tds
not funny 230k americans cant agree because they r dead will assume they agree with me

i really like those videos great insight of some of the players
this was already posted 9 hours ago

theyre creating some bad juju or good juju depending which side youre on
i was worried that the steelers would be complacent in facing the awful bengals this week im so glad the bengals twitter account ensured that the steelers will be very prepared
double yoy
the bengals are the kid from friday that knocks over ice cubes trash cans and talks shit as he rides away inevitably we catch them every year and beat their ass
lol the bengals infamously ate shit after that incident not sure why theyre bringing it up again
wait was that even a ravens player trashing the bungles for that tweet


reminder that the bengals havent won a playoff game in like 30 years

someone had the balls to give a vote to m garrett for cpoy thats rough
unless flores and the dolphins get even hotter through the second half of the season i think coach tomlin for coach of the year is the only lock

kinda surprised claypool didnt get a single vote for roty too though i dont fully expect him to win but his name has been in a ton of those conversations
tommy maddox was comeback player of the year the year before being replaced by ben coincidence who we drafting next year
we gonna talk about how derek carr had one mvp vote from david carr
the real question is is ben a lock for comeback player of the year am i forgetting someone
i feel like im really in the minority for thinking its dumb to vote alex smith as comeback player of the year by default just for recovering from a gruesome injury he just got significant playing time and throws 1 td and 3 picks and hes tied as favorite to me he is not the comeback player of the year if he cant play halfway decent its the comeback player award not the recovered from the worst injury award performance upon return should mean something
why david carr put out the only mvp vote for derek lol
oh god will someone think of the fire tomlin people they cant take the idea of him winning awards for coaching
unless something nuts happens in the second half itll come down to flores and tomlin looking at past winners the team that comes out of nowhere narrative tends to trump the dominant team narrative for coty

my guess is that if the steelers do not go undefeated and flores gets the phins to doubledigit wins itll be a close call

speaking of narratives the russell wilson for mvp narrative train is running full speed ahead and looks like its going to bowl through two more deserving guys how in the ever loving fuck does rodgers not get a vote
these selections are mostly on point although his play this year warrants it so far i really dont wanna see myles garrett win any awards ever i hope his production falls off a cliff would be great to see tj catch fire the rest of the season and put up some big sackstrip sacks

as far as comeback player of the year i really dont understand why alex smith is tied for 1st he came back from a horrible injury but hes a 3rd string qb whos seen barely any time at all and hes played like shit quite frankly props to him but theres players that come back from injuries all the time thats part of the game if youre not playing good then you shouldnt be in the player of the year category imo
he should have won it last year its easy to be a good coach when you have patrick mahomes 360 no scoping it 70 yards in the air to tyreek hill
love coach
im often critical of his decision making clock management losing to lesser opponents but the last 2 years he has done a great job even if you dont like him you have to begrudgingly admit he is a hall of fame coach a super bowl 2 conf championships and 14 years of 500 or better reg season if cowher got in i assure you tomlin will
lol at votes for myles garrett for comeback player of the year gimme a break
its about time
honestly i would vote for brian flores yeah sure were 80 but we also have the most talented defense ive ever seen one of the most athletic receiving cores in the nfl and a hof quarterback whose only gotten better as the years went on that you can always count on to get your team out of a pinch his influence has helped a lot with things like keeping the team focused on one game at a time and making sure the standard is the standard and things of that nature but what brian flores has managed to do in the past 2 years turning it from the joke of the league to a playoff contender is amazing i had the bills winning the division but i thought the dolphins would go at least 88 but most people didnt expect them to reach 6 wins now halfway through the season they are only one game back from leading their division in fact i might give me vote to kingsbury as well because hes done just about the same thing in the nfc
this team is winning because it has so many good players in no way does this team look well coached
am i an idiot or is the one mekhi becton vote completely unjustified
ben comes back and makes everyone look good
tonkin deserve noble peace prize and many other prizes guy is just a legend
i think had the steelers made the playoffs last year he would have won it then its tough to get the mvp type awards when you miss the post season
but i thought he should be fired whenever the steelers are down in a game
why adam rank chose mike tomlin there are some things about the steelers that are hard to believe like its hard to believe the organization had never started a season at 80 before this year and its hard to believe mike tomlin doesnt get more recognition for never having a losing campaign and while i contend that winning eight games last year without ben roethlisberger might have been more impressive what were seeing right now makes him my coach of the year
undefeated cant even be unanimous coty ben is playing just below the mvp qbs not consensus cpoty because of alex smith feels keep providing bulletin board material
lolololol david carr voted for his brother no nepotism there
tua has played not even 2 full games and he has more votes than chase claypool the rookie who has more tds than deandre hopkins stephon diggs and keenan allen on 1 less game
duh
how tf is alex smith tied with ben for cpoy i get what happened with his injury but he hasnt even been good at the slightest
i would hope he fucking is for to long has people said oh he is good but he isnt coach blah blah its a damn shame he hasnt wone it yet
when you get suspended for hitting someone who already had a concussion with a helmet and still get a vote for comeback of the year
my dad always told me that a coach is only as good as his quarterback look at tomlin last year vs this year and belichek this year vs last year i think hes right
ok thats one game what about the 7 other games so far mike tonkin doesnt just sit there with his thumb up his ass he coaches
lol no
i mean he should bewe are 80

l a r g e benjamin
his head size is to scale relative to the others
really living up as the leader of men
actual size
aiyuk szn
just for fantasy purposes not sure if ab is a good play for the rest of the season lol i think its going to take him a good 34 weeks to fully get up to speed ive got him on my team as well lol
alpha male
daaaamn boi thats a thicc ass boiii
he needs room for all that name
it may not be the smartest for fantasy purposes but i refuse to roster ab also no ratbirds
damn he really do be big

thanks for your service but not for how you have played this year

you should delete this
are you hoping he gets a staph infection
i have lived in north georgia most of my life and have yet to find a steelers fan near me to watch games im starting to get worried with how we keep playing games that im going to have a heart attack and noone there to call 911 for me lets use the buddy system with these uncertain games and keep each other safe so if anyone in north georgia wants to get together to watch the games let me know
youll be fine man just know that thousands of other steelers fans are out there stressin with you and that the only ones who will live through this are the ones with defibrillators
not quite north ga here but close in cumming ga go steelers
im older now ive seen just about everything in regards to steeler football ive watched the steelers play in 4 super bowls losing 2 so at this point i just get numb during these stressful moments im always expecting the worst outcome but if things swing our way i jump and scream just like everyone else
dang i wish im down here in coweta i see lots of steeler fans but i dont personally know any other than myself
braselton
we can probably lose our last eight games and still get in the playoffs where well still be the most talented team in the field and there wont be any home field advantage anyway

might be time to stop stressing your cardiac function unnecessarily the team needs your eyeballs to watch their ad revenue at work

thats pretty awesome ive been watching a lot of these on youtube the graphics are incredible have you crashed into your own house yet
i come in peace mods this is one of my favorite videos ive made and i figured you all would enjoy how your home stadium looks in the sim from field level


its the meme that keeps on giving
man was probably going thru it in that 1st half lmao
dos a cero

wait wrong sport
steelers steel city 90 sunday
am i stupid
ocho y oh

stephen a smith is not a steelers fan and idc how many times he says he is i was happy when ryan clark pretty much exposed him for not being one
i understand him putting the chiefs above us but the saints and bills he isnt staying off the weeedd bills got busted by the titans who we beat and the saints have looked good but their defense hasnt been consistent and theyve lost 2 games we should be 2nd at worst but that just means its time to prove the haters wrong
packers being here invalidates the whole list
wow chiefs i am fine with getting the nod above us its quite reasonable for people to toggle us and them as 1 and 2 bills that is very interesting of a choice not sure anyone else puts them in the top 3

saints ummm nah if its a vote for which team playing at its best for a full 60 minutes then perhaps the saints but we are also a clusterfuck of inconsistency and underperformance as well
i guess well see you know what they say about opinions
big ben has turned his team around from 88 to 80 with him pretty much being the only difference in the team hes continuously got us out of pinches to win games minus his 3 int game hes having the best year of his career then alex smith comes him for half a game and now theyre tied could you imagine being ben and doing everything hes done this year and being tied with someone who hasnt played a whole game and has a qbr of 32
its because alex smith has two legs and played football again

i also think ben should win but here is alexs leg last year
i mean the dude had his leg shattered fixed then developed multiple lifethreatening bacterial and flesheating infections was suggested amputation and against every odd possibly in the universe has played snaps in more than one game this season we all want to see ben win but i would have no issue whatsoever with smith getting that award
he isnt there is no mechanism to measure an award people vote on at the end of the season
because alexs injury took him out for two seasons and its amazing hes back on field again its more a comeback than it is from ben yeah we 80 and he has a huge role in that but still the thing alex is playing ball again is a huge achievement
the fact the smith is walking on his own leg is a miracle let alone playing in a game but i get your point
people when are you going to realize that the pundits do this precisely to get you talking about it

nobody in their right mind honestly thinks that alex smith has a better claim to this award than the ben however a unanimous vote for ben on tv wouldnt make for good tv

so we generate some controversy

its the same reason you still have the chiefs on top of plenty of power rankings
who cares and alex smith deserves more than ben anyways were 80 for crying out loud enjoy ffs lol
comeback player is about the story just as much as the players on field performance

smiths story is far above bens while bens performance is above smiths also there is no official tied or stats as of right now its speculation for the most part voters at the end of the season might heavily favor ben
well alex did almost die twice

when he took the field for the first time earlier this season the whole bar i was at applauded for him

then this last week when he threw for a touchdown everyone applauded again

so yeah for alex to win this award he pretty much had to put a uniform on and walk on the field and its his and i do not think there is a single player in the nfl who will be grudge him this award
because alex smith very much could have literally died of his injury

being playing again at all is a miracle comeback ben would need to play at mvp levels to beat that out imo
yeah but alex smith had so many surgeries and infections that he very nearly had his leg amputated

ben will will win but dont act like alex smith even taking an nfl snap again isnt a big deal too
i would think it a safe bet the entirety of this sub would think shazier would deserve comeback player of the year if he had made it back onto the field even if he was slow and missed every tackle just because of the effort it took to get back

i think if you could put your bias aside for a moment you would see it isnt the production on field so much as what alex had to get through to even make it back on the field

its one thing if you still think ben deserves it but if you cant even understand why alex is at least equally deserving there is something wrong with you
people dont like ben and for good reason
i mean if we win the super bowl im sure no one would care if ben won comeback player of the year event though he truly deserves it
you seem to be focusing pretty heavily about the on the field production and not the comeback portion the ap doesnt actually publish any criteria or anything so all the voters are left to their own judgments as well

roethlisberger is obviously far more productive than smith

smiths comeback is so many miles past what roethlisberger had to go through that i think a lot of folks myself included believe that it outweighs any and all differences in production
people just hate big ben thats all it ever seems like to me
i saw that and i said what the fck really loud in line at the gas station my wife had to point out how loud i was being this made no sense to me at all
i think alex smiths comeback transcends football and is pretty much a medical miracle wouldnt be upset about either winning because ben is also commander of one of the top teams in the nfl
you really think a super bowl winning qb would give a shit about some comeback player award give it to alex who cares
alex smith shouldnt be able to walk ben had elbow surgery
a ton of people already viewed alex smith as the comeback player of the year even if he didnt play a single snap its idiotic but thats the case his shitty performance didnt change anything they think its the best injury recovery award apparently
coming back from that kind of an injury is impressive but coming back and playing well is what cpoty is about you shouldnt win an award for existing

shouldnt lamar be me the ball is my diet and bud is doughnuts
i hate that you dont know how to spell donuts properly
you slap doughnuts too sweet
no
can you post the og pic


his super bowl record 75 yard td run to open the second half of super bowl xl remains one of my favorite plays in steeler history and by far my favorite run of his
him the bus was an absolutely ridiculous combination imagine trying to tackle one of the most agile and fastest backs in the league in 2005 then having to take on bettis the down after absurd glad they got their ring
one of my favorite players growing up he used to rule madden with his 97 speed and 98 acceleration i think
i think hes still running untouched through the seattle backfield
the second jersey i ever got behind ben of course
they called him fast willie parker and he just ran 75 yards to score a touchdown in the superbowl

al michaels simultaneously older than dirt and a kid who just watched his first super bowl

well yeah ben isnt allowed in the building
if mason could just be an average player it would be fantastic
oh my i can just hear the but dobbs is better we want duck people screaming at this
bring charlie batch back
no to mason if anyone thinks he is the heir apparent to ben is clueless we need to find the next ben
i mean its pretty obvious that was going to happen


quack
yeah

in b4 one of masons paid shills comes in here and writes stop being mean to mason he is doing the best he can1 hes the same as wentz statistically excuse 1 excuse 2 excuse 3

between him leaving the defense getting incredibly expensive etc we are gonna suck for a couple years imo

that being said we can use the cap savings from ben to pay almost the entire defense and draft a qb to try and insert could get lucky but likely will suck
who do i want trevor lawrence after we trade berry to adam gase for the 1 oa i will also take joe burrow for a 5th
fitzmagic he is the perennial good luck chuck of quarter backs and hes fun to watch unless we get lucky in the draft our next qb will most likely be an interim guy so why not fitz
i think we could realistically get mac jones out of alabama hes looked really solid this year
a roethlisberger retirement comes with a 225m dead money hit in a year where the cap is likely to go down so its probably going to have to be someone cheap also worst place you can be in the league is a 69 win team because of mediocre qb and a pretty good roster puts your team in purgatory for a handful of years that way

if darnold could be had for cheap i think hes the only real viable option cheap meaning like a 3rd rounder otherwise you let rudolph sink or swim probably sink and then get a top 10 qb in 2022 draft
quackquackquackquack
arod
aaron rodgers
the pipe dream is dak somewhat realistic draft dream is lance and realistic possibility dealing with minshew darnold or fitzmagic for a mediocre season or 2 and then trying to get a stud like uagalelei
jameis

like really look at bridgewater this year hasnt been amazing sure but he has improved sitting behind bress and is definitely the best youll get in free agency would need a first round qb no matter what though
sam darnold is showing hes worse than a washed up joe flacco imho there is just no way id take him
i wouldnt even notice who suited up next year ill need a twelve month nap to recover my chi
pj walker if he could look as good as he did in the xfl although i highly doubt he would
he already said he is playing out his contract didnt he

why must we have this discussion on almost a daily basis

kyle trask if he falls into the late 20s the steelers need to trade up for him hes as close as the steelers will get to drafting a superstar qb given they never really draft in the top 10 steelers got lucky that ben fell to 11 trask has the tools to be the next big ben he is the same size and same skill set

kenny pickett would be a steal in the mid rounds if the steelers wanted to draft a cornerback or lineman in the first or second rounds he may not be a superstar but he has the tools to be a good starting qb
justin fields out of osu i highly doubt he will be there at 32 but if something weird happens that would be amazing
kenny pickett
jameis minshew or trubiskyfoles
if he retires before the draft then definitely draft someone this year our late first could get us a great qb since its such a deep class and waiting till next year could net a worse player even with a higher pick id also want us to pick up a guy like fitzpatrickas someone else said darnold if hes available or any older qb that a rookie can play behind
dak prescott
whoever we get lets get garrett gilbert as the backup
mathew stafford until we get a youngin
depending on where he drops to i reallu like florida qb kyle trask having a great senior year big like ben and much more mobile wouldnt mind seeing them pick him up right now hes the sixth ranked qb in the draft on cbs and theyre projecting him to fall to 59th this could al change obviously but i wouldnt mind trading up to like a mid late second to pick him up
aaron rodgers
if ben retires we have to start over at qb it would be dobbs or rudolph too much money tied up that would hit when he retires for the next couple of years we would go back to the late 80s and early 90s steelers and try to get there with defense
we cant afford dak he wants 40 mil and we need to shed salaries not add im very rarely up for trading up in the draft but in this situation i think we can actually make a reasonable deal for 1st pick
if ben retires we have to go after dak right our defense would still be too good to start tanking with
stop pretending sam darnold is going to turn it out for the better if he comes here hes not that good

x200b

if jerry jones decides to fuck dak see if he would bite on a 3 year 100 mil deal its a smidge more than his tag worth and about 9 mil savings from what bens hit would have been depending on how you build it out
trubisky
i agree with you darnold

peanut butter and fucking jealous
they hate us cause they anus
haters gonna hate and ainters gonna aint
its not too often you get to be the undefeated team sitting alone atop the entire nfl mountain and still get to play the disrespect card

this is a gift dont squander it
the cursed comment cam take it back
we do not care
they kinda do it to themselves with all these too close for comfort heart attack games
fuck yeah cam
bring on the hate losers pundits
also who cares what the pundits say let them hate i only care about those ws
or maybe they just watched us almost lose to the abysmal cowboys
kaboly is a hutt
they hate us because were good have nice people and havent cheated

i normally have tickets for sale but not this year msg me your email address section 208 row d seats 14


x200b

so 98 vaults the line while planting a hand on both the long snapper and dotson there he did this repeatedly throughout the game so apparently this isnt illegal why dont more teams do this seems like a very easy way to block kicks instead of sending a guy around from the edge

x200b

edit screenshot


i said the same thing on sundee bet the refs just didnt catch it
this is 100 illegal and really stupid of the refs to miss this on every kick

x200b

also just as bad on our coaching staff to have missed this because when things of this nature get missed once a coach points it out to the ref with a hey we think we saw this on the kick could you keep an eye on that for the next time for us and then it gets flagged
i thought this was illegal tbh


leverage is a penalty in football that is called on a team usually the defense when a player jumps over opposing players at the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle a player or block a kick and they make contact with a player on the opposing team prior or simultaneously as the ball is snapped
tbh he isnt jumping over them just between them if you look closely
sometimes it gets missed a similar thing happened in our favor during the titans game minkah jumped the line and touched one of their players during the missed fg
99 and 90 are both holding to keep the guards and tackles from being able to effectively cover their inside and outside gaps respectively and 98 is using the long snapper and guard for leverage dotson couldnt close down toward the snapper to help block 98 because his right shoulderpad is being pulledpushed down

the officiating crew chose to ignore it repeatedly for some reason
this is 100 illegal and iirc we were flagged for this a couple games ago which resulted in a first down which led to a td but i cant remember the game maybe tennessee i remember i was pissed we got flagged for it
this isnt illegal and basically everyone tries to do it the defender cant line up over the center but he can try to get inbetween them nearly however they want as long as they are lined up correctly usually the o line pushes them back we chose not to

go listen the arthur moats latest podcast he explains clearly how dotson and kam messed up a very fundamental technique to allow this
i think once the ball is snapped they can use dudes for leverage but idk for sure the person who can break this down for us deserves danny smiths job

is it like captn crunch

god bless your upper mouth skins
do they taste like victory
just in case anyone else wants to order them proceeds go to his foundation it comes in a 2 pack so im going to eat one box and keep the other as memorabilia
just ordered a two pack so i can ship one box to my buddy nice
what are they like any good it just a gimmick i live on the other side of the pond so wont be able to try them anytime soon
nowhere near as good as tommy gunn flakes or kendall krunch
they dont seem to be doimg much jumping is this like rice krispies where you have to add milk first


correct me if i am wrong but they do print for both teams i mean you have to ive heard the losing gear gets donated mostly overseas ive seen a few villagers wearing off gear on tv
anyone have what couldve been type gear i bought this in the strip a couple years ago i guess someone expected us to beat stan humphries and the chargers in the afc champ game that year damn you barry foster

bonus question what wouldve been the score of the super bowl that year if the steelers made it through and faced the 49ers
which african country is this from
not damn chargersdamn tim mckyer who got burned on the go ahead td in the 4th

just wanna say fuck cancer the cool thing about sports is that at the end of the day you can put the rivalries aside and enjoy something that everyone loves sorry for your loss bud
most of us arent total jaggoffs as many believe the steelers are a team of class and its sad to see in my opinion the few that arent and make a bad rep for the rest of us

anyway im sorry for your loss he sounded like a really good friend and i applauded you coming on here and saying that youre a bengals fan despite the possible negative karma you would probably get elsewhere

and can i have the link to the go fund me id love to support the family
id hit up cam hayward on social media i believe his dad struggled with cancer he might be able to hook your friends family up with something to honor your friend would be a great week for it



fuck cancer and fuck the bungals
man put those links up for the go fund me and we will spread em around
post the link bengal buddy rip to big joe prayers to his family and your community
link
honestly man cancer is so much bigger than a division rivalry or a play off spot

joe sounds like a great man its a shame we lost him when in reality we need those types of people the most
there is a huge difference between enemies and rivals
my thoughts for joes family and friends and for the loss they must be feeling he sounds like he was a good guy

but you can feel a heated even hated rivalry with another team and not hate the fans from the bottom of your heart i hate the ravens from a football rivalry perspective but i have no personal issue with ravens fans in general nor the team itself the ravens fanbase or any fanbase are just normal usually good people passionate for their football team just like steeles and bengals fans are passionate about theirs

objectively there is no such thing as evil nfl teams and evil nfl team fanbases its just a perspective issue

that move makes my head spin
minkah waving to the rams offense in the throwback jerseys is one of my favorite steeler pictures of the past couple years
the player is from utah valley state college lacrosse is big in utah believe it or not
imagine thinking youre a badass playing lacrosse
the fact that number 8 didnt fly in and earhole that douchebag during his little celebration says everything you need to know about where lacrosse players stand respectwise in the athletic community
yeah that was a beautiful move and he ruined it by letting us know his parents raised a punk bitch

im kind of surprised to see alualu practicing already wasnt expecting him to practice this week but this a nice surprise
even tho cam sutton held down seeing mike hilton back in the lineup be nice to see
nothing but good news assuming juju practices tomorrow or friday
id like to believe a lot of the nir are veteran days not having a proper bye will start to show its true colors over this next three game stretch
having hilton and tyson back would be huge

tysons knee at practice
im surprised at how bad hiltons injury is hes missed like 3 games already was it even sustained during a game
its wednesday my dudes
may just be me but what does dnp mean
has juju missed practice every week this season with minor knee soreness
oh yes missed mike hilton

last season we were 88 and this season we are 80 so far and the only difference is big ben but pundits are not even talking about it heck we arent even superbowl contenders with an 80 record frankly its annoying
seriously cmon hes been good but nowhere near the level of the mvp candidates 80 has been a team effort and heavily on the d in some games
cause his numbers aint that sexy mahomes like 251 right now and they 71
nah i love ben as much as any steelers fan but his numbers arent there yet dont get me wrong i agree that ben is the reason for this years success but its all about stats and wins when it comes to being an mvp of the nfl
you know why league mvps often times dont win it all because the thing that got em the award is probably what was masking a team issue that got exposed in the playoffs we dont have that issue and big ben isnt getting mvp

good thing we look more like a super bowl contender than we have in a decade
welli would venture to say that it has to do with riding a motorcycle without a helmet a bit of alcohol problem in his youth and two bullshit sexual assault accusations

it does suck because the guy has turned shit around and the worst of his transgressions were manufactured
most of the odds have him 6th behind russ mahomes rodgers allen and kyler i think thats pretty fair considering the numbers of the guys ahead its gonna be tough to crack that top 3 but i wouldnt say hes totally out of the conversation
hes come back player of year though
because he doesnt deserve to be

last year when they went 88 the line was always something along the lines of could you imagine if the steelers even got league average qb play theyd be a contender

well now theyre getting a little above league average qb play 14th in dvoa 10th in epa per play 26th in completion percentage over expected 10th in passer rating 19th in aya and sure enough theyre a contender but hes clearly not doing what other qbs in the league are doing
tj watt should be
if you put mahomes on the steelers we go 160 that simple
because hes far and away not the most valuable player in the nfl
why is this topic being mentioned near daily now do people not understand what wins the nfl mvp

its called individual stats not team record there are quite a few qbs leaving ben behind in every category
never has been never will be hes like pittsburgh itself his strength work ethic and production are just taken as a matter of course
this is a joke post right ben doesnt even come close to belonging in the conversation and if you think he does you absolutely do not watch our games
hes in the discussion his current odds have him firmly in the top ten but nowhere near number one which is pretty much where he belongs based on performance

his numbers arent going to put him in contention so hes relying almost exclusively on team record if the steelers finish two or more games clear of the field andor undefeated hell rush to the heart of the conversation late but barring that its hard to see a path
i wouldnt say the only difference between 88 and 80 is big ben

i like what juju has become this yeara sure handed first down machine is it me or does he seem bigger and stronger this year he gets those extra yards when you really need them
but some people still think signing juju isnt a priority
juju would possibly be number 1 or 2 if ben had to force it to him but he doesnt we have 3 wr who could be number 1 and james washington who is a great 2 and would possibly be a number 1 on a few teams but the way ben calls plays and does his thing it catches defenses off guard thats why if ben called the plays the whole game i wouldnt be suprised if we broke 50 imo
in juju we trust we have to find a way to keep him and well deal with picking 2 of the 3 out of claypool dj and jwash when the time comes by that point we could have drafted another star receiver to make things even tougher because thats just steelers things
in search of a steelers bar in nashville and the interweb has pointed me to establishments that are now closed

help
idk if its just my area or the whole state but all bars are closed
theres a pandemic quarter million americans dead ring a bell



im sorry but this doesnt make sense the third column when referred to the one above it is actually a good thing it would be more like panik kalm excite
they did just beat the titans i think we need to respect the energy that joe burrow bring that team i hope we play to our potential because we should be able to control the game but i worry lol


bengals fans acting like they got khalil mack in the comments lmao
dont you mean 4d tikk takk toe
i loved the hyped bengals fan comments followed by a falcons fan saying hes trash
im not sure if theyre playing the right game
i dont get it
why are they focusing on their d when bracing the o line would be better for them im kinda confused at this signing

a 36 team with a new coach cut a guy who didnteven contribute to their last win and bengals fans get excited why do you people even go to that place
he tweeted the bengals were trash a couple years back he is now trash apparently
meh free pickup of a decent player good for them wont help them this sunday
takk sucks tho


nice its been a fun season thus far health of the team will determine how much more fun well have for the remainder of 2020
almost forgot about how often we were down by two scores in these games
the amount of times we are behind in this clip yet undefeated crazy
love wish it lasted til bosgods 59 yarder
ive had the pleasure of watching every single one of these games this season i have to say taking that early bye week kinda screwed us
claypool is a beast
week 1 seems so far away
christ this teams wr corp is talented if ben tightens up his deep ball there is not a secondary that can keep up
when its pieced together like this it really shows how ben has thrown some absolute dimes this year
james washington exists yo
defense has kept us in every game boy are they fun to watch too
missing jujus pylon cam celebration and he missed it
awesome highlight reel good stuff
love the energy this team brings
amazing video we are so damn good
great video and great use of renegade by styx
beautiful
bless you
this video is beautiful
that claypool kid looks like he might be good
its been great so far this video made me realize how big of a pickup ebron was also shoutout to bos a couple hiccups but a solid season so far
nice buds strip on jackson gave me goosebumps again
love it
this is really cool well done
alright while i love this video i have but one complaint

this just made me was a defensive highlight video watching tj bud get after that qb over and over made me wanna see cam steph devin before he got hurt

edit just wanna be clear i love this video great work man
thanks for this got me pumped for sunday
love this defense
nice ive been so frustrated with bens deep ball the past 23 games that i forgot he threw some absolute dimes in the first few
good job
enjoy it while it lasts with the news in chicago 30 day lockdown today theres probably not much football left
the renegade got me going quick i was bouncing in my chair by the end of the video
too little defense for a renegade highlight reel but i get it scoring is what the casual fans like

for me ill never forget the deflating disappointment of losing that win and in game against the ravens backup jabronis in 2015 while all those baltimore jagoffs chanting seven nation army at us jack white isnt even from baltimore i kept yelling at the tv in my rage while we made ryan mallet look like dan marino

im getting worked up all over again whatchu got
fucking oakland in 2018
week 3 at chicago in 2017
i forget the year but jacksonville when ben threw 5 ints i cant remember if it was trap or not though

worst trap game with a win is jacksonvillwhen ben ran in the td at the end of the game and the offense really couldnt do anything after that game is when the team really started falling apart 721 to 961 at end of season no playoff either and not been back since i think this years game will go better but i may be wrong
8 turnover game against the browns in 2012 the steelers fumbled 5 times and charlie batch threw 3 picks

nobody remembers it though because the very next week was the game where charlie batch beat the ravens

beating the eventual superbowl champions after losing to the browns in an 8 turnover debacle is just steeler things
reading the top two comments makes me really sad i was at oakland 2018 black hole where we missed the kick and in chicago 2017 yikes triggering memories

i was also at san diego 2015 where bell ran for a td as time expired and arizona last year for ducks last good game so that balances it out
i cant believe nobody has talked about the one jets game ben throws 6 tds vs the colts then throws another 6 tds vs the ravens then gets beat by the jets who were atrocious
the tebow playoff game
tampa in 2014 losing to glennon was embarrassing
i still have ptsd from that 333 eagles game a few years back
nobody remembers a recent ravens game where they signed ryan mallet off the streets that week and he whooped our ass

edit sorry it was a week and a half before the game
its rare that the afc championship game could be considered a trap game but in the 19941995 season it was the steelers were by far the best team in the afc they dallas and san francisco were by consensus in a class of their own with nobody else really even close san diego wasnt even considered a good alsoran after squeaking out a win over miami in the divisional round while the steelers crushed cleveland the city was electric and the fanbase excited for the big game that big game being the super bowl not the afccg there was even a song with lyrics something like pittsburghs going to the super bowl

and then they played the actual game suffice to say they did not win worst trap game in history because it came on the biggest stage and derailed their best shot for a championship in decades alfred pupunu still haunts my dreams
give me a minute i gotta go through my files of trap games
early aughts oakland and houston dont feel like looking it up but we outgained something like 400 yards to 75 in each and lost we may have been oaklands only win that year boyh were terrible
tampa bay game like 5 or 6 years ago where we won 1914 and they were so bad

edit was actually vs jaguars won 179 in a downright awful game
the chargers in the afc championship game stan humphries stan freaking humphries and natron means our defense blew that game on a pass to tuatupa
last week would have been near the top of the list had we lost
the expansion texans in 2001
jacksonville has had our nunber lately
ugh i went to that game brutal loss great seat at least

to be fair i always bring up the murderer when i talk to a ratbird fan
shits so fucking annoying like its the fans fault for what our players do
good news i checked the legal history neithers ours

now fuck off

hes a goddamn hero
was korea the last positive war waged by the us guess the first iraq war was a minor success every other us hot war has been a massive failure
and yes rocky is a hero in every sense of the term
i watched the show documenting his visit back very deep
why are there no tickets available to this game home i cant find them any where
because the 5000 tickets available are raffled off randomly to season ticket holders for first right of refusal and that hasnt happened yet
i know this is a trap game situation this sunday but they better not even begin to play down to them after the disrespect i pray that this team can light that fire and put some respect on our flag will be really disappointed in these guys if they dont make that happen
divisional games are not trap games
wish people would stop calling this a rivalry game not every divisional team is a rival steelers have dominated the bengals and browns for the past 2 decades ravens are actually competitive
i was cracking up earlier this week about how sensitive cowboyscowboys fans are about their precious star and now im cracking up remembering how sensitive steelers fans are about a towel

this is what i love about the steelers the legends usually become huge fans like us regular people
this is how every single steelers fan watches the game doesnt matter where youre from
im cracking up over this it really embodies how i feel every single game his face when lamar threw that last pass lol
pretty much lol itd be nice to blow more people out like say the cowboys or doodoos or bungles
i know ill get downvoted for this but oh well ive met jerome a few times once while filming a commercial and during some downtime asked him what he thought about how the season was going he could not care less except when he was getting paid to say so which i definitely dont blame him because im sure its exhausting but it takes some of the shine off these staged theyre just like us promos


the pro football hall of fame should be in pittsburgh

arguably so should the rock n roll hall of fame fuck alan freed
by he way in 1982 1892 a touchdown was worth 4 a field goal 5 and a safety 2 so the 40 score came from hefflefingers fumble recovery for a td they must have missed the conversion kick which would have been worth 2 points
football the mattress factory the aviary gus yiayias and all the crack you could hope to buy is there anything the north side cant do
random thoughts on william heffelfinger

1 in 1892 people who are 63 and 210 pounds are nicknamed pudge i dont think thats even considered dad bod today

2 heffelfingers 500 payment was the equivalent of 14200 in 2019 dollars players making the minimum nfl salary in 2019 got game checks of 29117 obviously the players now make more but considering how much the game has changed i find it kind of interesting how close those numbers are heffelfinger got paid in cash not by check but if randy moss is to be believed many nfl players do carry that much cash around

3 the oldtimey scoring system was whack

4 when i was a kid it always annoyed me that the first professional football player was a lineman now i kind of like it

5 college football was taken seriously enough even in the 1880s that somebody probably paid a professional ringer to play in a college game before 1892
never heard of this guy my hometown of latrobe always said it was the birthplace of professional football so now i dont know what to think it probably wasnt


if anyone uses the telegram chat app and knows of a steelers sticker set please let me know been looking for one but no joy yet
thanks
been watching his highlights would seem like a good db
and where in the draft do you expect him to go
this would be a very futureofthenfl pick in my opinion in some respects his skill set is duplicative of what you have in minkah but i feel like the way the nfl is moving having multiple guys on the back end who can play that way can be incredibly useful and effective the steelers like to use minkah in that robber role anyway when they are in cover 1 and sometimes the hook in cover 3 so having holland playing the centerfield role behind him would really make it tough on defenses down the middle

with that being said i think the steelers fits at safety are going to push that down their board in terms of priority so i dont see him being the pick
obviously its not indicative of how his actual nfl career will shape up but in madden this year playing as the jags i used a real life draft class and was able to snag jevon holland in the 2nd round about pick 1320 idr exactly which one anyway by 3 years he was like the 2 or 3 safety in the whole league and was amazing

then i watched his irl highlights and thought he was pretty good and as a steelers fan would love to see him i think we have a few more glaring needs we will need to fill early in the draft so i dont see it happening i think he will have a great career either way
were getting kyle pitts tho
im a student at uo so ive watched him play a lot and id be so down for this hes a ballhawk in the truest sense of the word and is incredibly versatile at least at the college level if we drafted him i do wonder if wed keep him at safety or if wed move him to nickel corner

dudes electric through and through though bummed me out when he opted out of the season but it was completely understandable and definitely the right move for him


joey porter sucking oxygen complaining to sad bengals fans about how tired he gets from whoopin their asses god i love it

fuck the bengas fuck that shithole town fuck their fans

i lived in cinci for 4 years during college and i couldnt wait to gtfo of there its a backwards cliquey racist city that wants to be a part of the south terribly
your name makes me sad
i love joey porter
god i wish i knew who yelled that in the background
well damn thats why i couldnt post this haha you beat me to it
its simple i see cowher i upvote
were their baby
bungles have two other teams with good to elite ass rushes balt philly the steelers pass rush is better

balt 7 sacks
philly 8 sacks
aint happening if we repeat the last two weeks and have to play safe because we failed to stop the run hopefully alualu being back will be the missing piece
good to elite ass rushes

righteous
not gonna get close to 7 sacks if they play the same bullshit defense they played last week seeing tj watt used to cover so much and constantly playing mlb is infuriating let him rush the qb like the all pro he is i really cant stand keith butler
joe burrow is about to look like joe dirt running from our dline
if butler tries to mail this in like in dallas its going to be the same base d against five wide bs no sacks
sounds counterintuitive but some of it falls on our offense we need to get up early so that theyre compelled to run more than throw
if we let tj work rather than throwing him into coverage every play yeah easily more
im expecting maybe 3 this is trap game pt 2 and theres no getting around it

nflbitecom
nflbitecom has been absolutely solid all year it lets you pick what streamer to use the top 2 ones are always the best today the game is also on slingtv which is an app you can download on your phone or tv if you dont have slingtv just do the free trial watch the game then cancel the subscription i typically will use nflbite and screencast my computer to my tv
i also like sportssurgecom
crackstreams works for me originally found it as as solution to stop getting charged up the ass for redzone
how to listen to if im not in dve s range
thank you
i use nfl sunday ticket but its apparently being broadcasted in my area today so i cant watch it
bilasportnet
dofusports app is perfect for streaming you get one or two ad before the stream links open and its been flawless since i started using it


nflbite
volokit is steady as well

this is clearly aaron rodgers
not thicc enough to be ben
i was expecting to see a picture of amy schumer out for a walk
this is clearly andrew luck

if you think the georgia sunshine made ben here look younger and slimmer you should see what it did for ashley

jesus christ were really in their heads rent free i just popped over to that sub for the first time this week and literally almost every single post is about us i mean i guess when your favorite team is that awful franchise theres nothing better to talk about other than how much you hate the better teams in your division
i mean he isnt lying on the tomlin part
this pretty much sums up the bengals sub in a single post

just a bunch of people sitting around sniffing their own farts and thinking themselves superior because they root for a historically shitty team

analysis nope injury reports not really opponent discussions just post a fuck thread individual match ups just masturbate to a fantasy that is years away interviews they dont do that there

the best part is they all go wild when someone claims to root for the bengals just because of joe burrow bengals are just dying for some bandwagon fans
lol imagine thinking ben is everyones fav player over tj and minkah

i love ben but he may not even be top 3 fav atm
try living in cleveland bruh


although i will say browns fans have been chill this year cant really say shit when were undefeated in week 10
hi fellow ohio steelers fan lets do this today
i wear dan kreiders jersey you see special teams players jerseys in the stadium i would say we are one of the fan bases that knows their team depth the best bengals fans arent allowed to talk about loyalty i currently live in central ohio and you dont see a bengals jersey unless they are winning win or lose you see steelers and brown jerseys i even saw a sipe jersey on a weekday near the end of last season it was a sight
holy shit thats just sad
i didnt know that the browns the titans and the ravens were bad teams
lets refer to tomlin as thou dude from now on
been a steelers fan all my life never once called for tomlins job fucking amazing coach i learn the names of every steeler who makes a play and i do love big ben as a true steeler fan i know defeat i know shooting ourselves in the foot and most importantly i know the steelers can pull off any win if we show up so win or lose steelers are always number one in my book best team in the nfl
aint wrong about the fans and tomlin though shit is annoying
something tells me that this dude only knows ben also
im 50

i sat in the dawg pound with my faced painted black and gold in 1991

ive been to a pens flyers game in 1988 before the pens were really good where flyers fans were picking fights

hands down bengals fans are literally the stupidest fan base ive ever encountered in my life
not even close its an aggressive stupidity too
damn i literally cant name one other player besides big ben

someone help me who else is on the team
little do they know that i will full out ugly cry when tomlin does leave and pouncey and heyward are the backbone in my opinion love this team through and through
their wifebeater rb is out today so its all down to tj and bud vs burrow and ill take our boys every day of the week

edit not a wife beater just caught on camera punching some random girl in the face

who dey who dey gets knocked out of the playoffs every time they play the steelers who dey has a packed escalator leaving the upper tier of their stadium when the stands were allowed to be full at the end of the 3rd quarter during a steelers game who dey the bengals have been and always will be the bungles they might be in the lead but theyll figure out a way to lose the game
im still waiting for burrow to light up our secondary is he not playing today
being a bengals fan is detrimental to your health go steelers
a little bizarre seeing the tomlin take here since the bengals fanbase and media pressure literally chased out a guy who posted winning season after winning season and playoff appearance after playoff appearancewhile coaching the fucking bengals

marvin lewis deserves hof votes for lifting that team to the staggering heights of meh for so many years
check out their sub the amount of whining about the refs helping us and the crying about how dirty of an organization we are is like every other post we are living rent free and im loving it
joey porter im tired of whoopin yall ass yall make me tired


bengals games always reminds me of a quote from mad men

pete bengals fans i feel bad for you

don us i dont think about you at all

steelers by 20
i deal with it too living in ohio and jesus it gets annoying im not nearly as loud about our team as i could be because i believe in being classy but they have no idea what the word means
bunch of front running band wagoners living in a trailer is a pretty funny insult from a guy whose grammar this bad
live score check in 367 that guys post did not age well
ok hes got a point about fans calling for tomlins job

not all of us but still
theyve only played bad teams anyone wanna tell him
yo i live in ohio and my entire family are die hard browns fans its halarious on steelersbrowns game day to hear them scream in agony while i quietly laugh at them
i can hear the lisp and missing teeth that cinci trash bag has in his writing
fan based gate keeping is the worst

one of my best friends is a brownie and i consistently know more browns playerscoaches then her however year after year shit show after shit show she goes crazy nuts supporting the browns it wouldnt bring me the same joy shitting on the browns if she wasnt a real fan

just because you dont know a lot about your team doesnt mean you are not a fan
theres a kernel of truth there people around here call for tomlins head weekly however i dont understand how people are still saying we havent faced good teams
the ones living in a trailer are probably the furthest away from steeler bandwagon fans
they put chili on spaghetti noodles so they can shut the fuck up and keep breathing out of their mouths
they hate us cuz they aint us
fuck the tiger browns
one time at a high school football game some kid was wearing a joe flacco jersey my brother said why do you like the ravens you live in pa and the kid replied bro you bandwagon i bet you couldnt name anyone besides the qb and wrs and my brother proceeded to name the entire steelers roster then we asked the kid who on the ravens he knew and he only named the stars
right cuz pittsburgh is nothing but sprawling trailer parks moron
tj watt hes got us there on the tomlin bit and how does your shoe taste buddy
ragedlikemilk
they really have a huge little brother complex they want us to be a rivalry and beat us so bad really theyre just fighting for relevance
wait is this person saying we all live in one big trailer
holy shit dude hit the shine a little early in the day
theyre just a classless organization and things of that nature
joe gonna torch that secondary cant wait to post this on ragedlikemilk
rent free
they hate us cuz they anus whos 251 d
you think this is bad just check twitter its so toxic on there even been swims shazier slander
i live in ohio 45 minutes west of downtown a very heavy steelers area but i still occasionally get the how can you not be a brownsbengals fan if you live in ohio

like motherfucker since when does the state dictate your fandom
that mans been breathing those jim beam fumes out the river too long
it does suck living in ohio and being a steelers fan but on the other hand i love it i dont know what hes talking about when he says bandwagoners i go shopping every sunday and when the browns are on a losing streak i dont see nearly as much browns gear when im out and about then when the week before they won a game or are on a winning streakwhich is rare thats the definition of bandwagoners its extremely noticeable too i love it when browns fans say steelers suck like it hurts my feelings
tomlin has made some questionable decisions as far as challenges play calls etc the main thing i cant understand is why so many people are ready to get at his throat it is after all the nfl most of the time its go big or go home and he likes to go big and im not mad at the man for it the team wouldnt be where they are now if it wasnt for tomlin and we should appreciate him more cant wait for out boys to whip some bengal ass today go steelers
pff bengals fans dont even know bout the deaneglo williams
ohio shares a border with kentucky and west virginia
i lived in cincy for years nice city but during the 2000s it was more common than not for their home game to be blacked out due to not selling out seats say what you will about the browns but they have real fans cincy is fair weather as all hell
i live in ohio and most of these people work hard jobs for min wage and beat their wives root for the browns and live to hate the best
get a load of this jackass

guys

fuck the ravens

and fuck facebook
tbf hes right about yinzers calling form tomlins head
lololol im a steelers fan born and raised in cincinnati and they stay hating
team has only faced bad teams this year
did you just trash your own team
ive always found bengals fans way more obnoxious than any other fans
we dey bitch we always dey
hm is this guy still talking now i dont hear him or a third down conversion for that matter
when your franchise is as great as ours its hard remembering the names of all the greats that played for us
get wrecked bungles
every cinci fan i know is embarrassed and wants the team sold
i have never called for tomlins job i have never watched the steelers win a super bowl cuz the last time they did i was like 9 and was too dumb to understand football i love the steelers because my dad has loved the steelers almost his whole life you wanna talk about bandwagoners look at half the patriots fan base that only became fans after they started winning super bowls
ohio here my browns fan in laws have literally made me not care about football anymore they take all of the fun out of watching
love the part of the steelers only faced bad teams as if the bungles are a good team lol
tj watt is my fav but i really enjoy 99 of this team
thats rich coming from the fan whos team hasnt won a playoff game in like 30 years
damn sure speaking like a 6635 all time
what a clown
lol
the tomlin part is facts though i had to stop reading the game day thread because of that
those last 2 sentences tho
i know more browns fans than i do bengals and theyre a much more classy group of people basically the bengals want to be the ravens so badly they mimick their crowd
jealousy is unbecoming
im not against going on their subs game thread if anybody wants to join
even in their shit talking posts we have them admitting tomlin is the best coach in the nfl theyre down bad know it
we got yinzers ready to fire tomlin after any given bubble screen
well it was pretty brutal that part was right
only yellow i like is piss
hes not wrong about fans calling for tomlins job if they lose today the tomlin haters will finally warm up their keyboards on that first l
psh do they not realize we also root for the pirates
removed


first play run up the middle with conner probably try a short pass or screen after that then on 3rd down make ben try to convert a third and long and god forbid a screen actually works well be running that play for the rest of the game im predicting we fall behind early and then rely on ben to make another improbable comeback
2 yard run up the middle with conner as the first offensive play is a virtual certainty in this game
every yinzer thinks every play should go for a first down and every drive for a touchdown
or the one we all want 75 yard touchdown to chase claypool on first play and then we get vintage big ben
is it just me or are we really not running that many screen passes this year and the ones we do are usually successful
1st play conner left side

2nd play conner middle

3rd play screen to conner right side 1st down

4th play ben throws it 180 yards into the parking lot 2 yards past claypool
i thought cbs is the dedicated afc network why is fox showing two afc teams playing each other does it have something to do with the game being flexed
cbs has the masters this weekend which takes precedence for them
might be im cool with it though since the bills are playing at the same time which usually means western ny cant watch the steelers play without sunday ticket
yeah it really doesnt matter to mei just found it odd that fox was airing an afc matchup
i really dont care for foxs drawings of players that they plaster all over every 30 seconds they just seem so out of place to me
a few years ago the nfl decided that they were going to occasionally mix nfc and afc games between fox and cbs to maximize viewing availability for the most part they stick to their own networks but sometimes youll see them crossover like this weeks game
they started doing this a few years ago its to maximize viewership usually starts later im the season as it gets closer to playoff seeding
it is odd for fox to have a game with two afc teams but not unseen i think the whole cbsafc foxnfc thing is more of a guideline they use than a hard rule when they set the broadcast schedule after all there are lots of interconference games that one of them has to take
this game was supposed to be cbs at 1pm and got moved because of golf
the masters are broadcast on cbs so it got booted to fox
ill miss romos astute analysis and objective commentary

s

edit just looked up the fox announcers for today kenny albert johnathan vilma i dont think i remember who they are at least its not joe buck

doesnt help that were basically the bungles super bowl every year
mine with my one friend are just a lot of ahhhhhhhhhhhhs and such
the standard is the standard


thats 251 thank you very much
youre cringe
lmao
stop going to other teams subs to talk shit and troll pretty much the opposite of the steeler way
funny but may be against sub rules
youre just asking for a ban from here and there how smart
trolling other teams subreddits doesnt make you cool it makes you an asshole
ban this guy
stop this shit its very poor style youre embarrassing


damn didnt even try on this repost
this was posted yesterday and it is still extremely disturbing

im getting a puppy next week and i think he needs one of these

ohio steeler fan here

its currently just after 130 pm and the game in cleveland was delayed with both of these games on fox we can expect the cleveland game to run over and the steelers game not broadcast for a minute right

annoying but i guess this is what i get for living in browns country
i think the pgh market theyll switch over to the steelers game at 425 rest of the country no idea
use nflbitecom or sportsurgenet to catch the first part of the steelers game thats what im gonna do
i am in the same boat and unfortunately i think it means that we just lost at least the first 30 minutes of our game unless this thing on now flies by
just stream it til the game comes on live
at least the brownstexans game is a thriller
crackstreamscom
they better go to a more competitive game

isnt that the bs they gave us earlier
might have a delayed start in pgh too same weather that delayed cle is headed this way so it might be fine honestly
how much will we have to come back by at half
idk why but im optimistic well be up 177 at the half i know we usually play down to worse teams but im feeling good today
this is a we will be up at halftime game then it will be close as the end
1414
im saying its 22 at halftime and the steelers win 42 in overtime
either 14 up like the one anon commented or 010 or 313 not picking a team for those scores

10 years from now ill see you at a game wearing that and be like oh shoot i remember that dude those are my favorite type of jerseys
ill be damned good for spillane getting some representation in the naish
dhgate
nice
but why


rub some dirt on it and call it game worn
try rubbing alcohol if its ink alcohol will dissolve it
pull it over your head and open a beer that ought to just about do the trick
try rubbing alcohol
spill some mustard from your kielbasa on it
it looks like a rub in the vinyl hit it with a little white sneaker fix shit and call it a day
looks like that antitheft ink good luck if so

get it autographed or use it for tailgating if you drink and eat as much as i do youll get something else on it and the ink stain will seem inconsequential
take it to a dry cleaner if it can be removed they will remove it

point it out to them and see what they say

removed

glad tyson is back
man i hope hilton gets better soon
thankfully the team learned from last week and didnt play mcfarland or kdot also sucks that buggs is gone but im glad to see more of carlos davis
dobbs is inactive because hes got his hands full calling the right plays on offense
why is bugsnax inactive

hows the weather i heard its pretty terrible with the wind
check out the american flag looks pretty strong goal posts slightly more subdued the open end has always been tricky here lets hope it doesnt come down to fgs for us
and the bengals will be your sacrifice
while you are there make sure you honor the mr rogers shrine for good fortune
lets go
nice this is the first year in a decade i wont be able to make it its been an annual trip for my fatherinlaw and i originally wed drive in together from chicago and now we meet up there after i moved to raleigh 2020 sucks

the steelers have just scored from the heinz red zone you too can score with heinz thick and rich ketchup from your local giant eagle
in 2020 the pittsburgh steelers are 90

like what lololol is this real life
my mom is british

not 100 sure what that means but i think she wants him to hit the holes and run northsouth
juju

lit

ben

goat

boz

god
imagine talking all that shit all twitter just to show up like this lol couldnt imagine
90

drink it in
burrow has that look on his face like holy shit is this my life now yes son it is
tj watt makin a name for himself

motherfucker hes already made a name for himself and is building a god damn empire
its lit

here we go steelers

upvote for good juju
whys the they saying it was three and out diontae had a first down lmao
i thought edmunds had that for a moment and nearly spilled my chinese food

nearly a double tragedy
goal line fades are literally the most inefficient play in football
lol im pumped for the shotgun hand off to conner coming up
bengal fans talking about how steelers are a one and done team when they cant even make it to 500 lmao
found a fan in the stands with his jersey

uhyou mean his family
minkah is so damn good and 90 of the positive stuff he does just doesnt show up on the stat sheet or wouldnt be noticeable without all 22 film
that sack was a smaller play nonsteeler fans miss that make tj the dpoy took the bengals out of a scoring opportunity

vilma openly rooting for the bengals
going from romo to fucking vilma is like night and day and thats still an understatement
whats up with fox doing these cringe cartoons of players like who thought that was a good idea
i want a ps5 so bad guys
joe haden is being considerate of the cold rain and blanketing these receivers to keep them warm
i dont watch fox football coverage much i am already tired of the animations
vilma sounds genuinely devastated that ben didnt throw a pick
bengals pull burrow i like the kid
he has to feel these losses

nah the guys been smacked around today he absolutely feels it give the poor guy a rest and make sure he doesnt get hurt
this is what they get for posting the towel video sometimes i forget that were one of their biggest rivals lol
3 heisman qbs in the division and the best one is the one who played in the mac conference
stop doing that play
that a boy claypool move that ball
nfl talking heads tomorrow if that was mahomes he would have thrown it for 97 yards and scored a touchdown thats why the steelers just arent good
please mapletron not you dont let him be hurt
spillanes been watching too much polamalu film
thats 20s third forced fumble

amazing how he isnt even our bests slot corner
need to get to burrow no pressure
conner today yikes
bungles subreddit is imploding and its brings true tears to my eyes
does vilma not like the steelers or something
yo yall see that arizona hail mary wtf
why the fuck is joe burrow out there
john vilma sucks
burrow heisman 20 years after ben was in college


ben and i took that personally
lmao did edmunds just catch someones foot
ive been hesitant on drafting an rb high this year after weve spent 3 mid round picks on a row on rbs and i think offensive line is a bigger need unless a qb falls to us but maybe we should consider a najee harris or a travis etienne
thought ben was gone bust out a run lmao
steelers fans looks like conner hype is back on the menu

shame we cant rely on a run game to pick up 2 yards on third down
watt up to 9 sacks garrett only was given half a sack today gap has been closed

x200b

also jesus that slick sidline i dont wanna see burrow hurt from shit like that
prevent defense is typically the bane of ever fans existence but that is exactly how youd want to run defense against their last drive of the half
i wanna see a singing contest that really puts someones skills to the test and their belief in themselves think youre the best prove it drink a poison and if you win the match you get the antidote otherwise its lights out
haden is kicking all sorts of ass today
u know randy was twitching at halftime knowing they havent gone run run pass on a 3 and out yet
ben literally pump faked a defender onto the ground best pump fake of all time
claypool is the next megatron

johnson is the next ab

juju is the next hines
i want the steelers to drop a 40 point game on the bengals so bad lol
vilma i was also drafted in 2004 everyone
vilma must have money on cincy the way he was just crying
vilma with a literal boner because cincy made a play down 30 points in the 4th
baker mayfield with a noose around his neck looking at joe burrow first time
this commentator wont stop sucking off the bengals
hear me out


4th quarter


nothing but deep pass until we complete one
i hope i dont get downvoted for this but i like burrow honestly i think he could become a really good qb in the future with more time and experience
i return with chinese food and bless the old ladys heart who took my order and included two sets of chopsticks and two fortune cookies thinking i was ordering for two

i assure her and everyone else im just fat

chinese food is here dogs and myself are in our jerseys got a good sativa ground up testing at like 255 and a victory preroll on standby for tomorrow morning when i get off work

lets fucking go
how the fuck is that not a safety
conner isnt very good
dont you dare mention rudolph
another 3rd and 5 into the fucking bleachers
dobbs seems like a good dude
chase bb please be ok
ben to johnson looks exactly like ben to ab when they connect
watching strip fumbles in slow motion is honestly the best thing
very smart by ben give the ball back to the bengals so were closer to their end zone when they fumble again
so we beat the ravens and cowboys by doing things needed to win
i hate listening to vilma so much
well theres that big shit the bed play
vilma hates the steelers as much as yall think romo does
why does our defense go from being lockdown and forcing a fumble to looking like swiss cheese and completely confused
patrick mahomes is really good at cornhole
alright were still up 5 we got this
jonathan vilma plz shut up
burrow is legit very good hopefully the bengals end up squandering his talent so he can find success somewhere else
jc isnt an outside type runner why are we running stretch plays with him
can someone pleasepleaseeee explain to me why the fuck do they run conner outside seriously wtf its never been his thing and never will be his thing fucking knock it off randy go eat a cheeseburger
comments a bit negative for being up 227 at the end of the 2nd
imagining tj whispering to burrow on the ground get used to this sweetheart
tj and bud dupree are the best pass rush duo in the nfl and its not even close
those fox qb graphics are so weird lol
ok yall we get the bengals sub is bitching just as we do when we lose like this but leave them alone posting there is annoying and petty for us both
we need to finish this game with over 40 points weather isnt ideal but who gives a shit step on their throats leave no doubt how dominant this team really is
winning playoff games will be hard without a run game
for the rest of the game the d needs to keep on blitzing the rook needs about 34 more sacks to truly be welcomed to heinz field
fox you fucking idiots went to take a break when shit was happening
claypool is the receiver ben has always wanted
lmao at that cb talking shit to claypool while down 4 scores
watch me throw this over that mountain
vilma so upset
i dont like to wear baggy clothes but if tomlin doesnt look like the comfiest mf every week on the sidelines all layered up
its really nice to see us beat the living shit out of an inferior team for once
love that the party has already started on the sideline lol
the bengals called a fake punt down 29 points so their1 draft pick could get hit more times
lmao i love that the defense seemed to take that fake punt personally if youre gonna pull some hoe shit at the end of a game thats over then were gonna make you pay
is it just me or do we need an interception to make this complete
i actually am interested in watching rudy play in a low pressure situation
mason looked good there
that chip on bens shoulder has been our mvp for years
the standard is the standard
vilma he feels the loss either way i promise
no heart attacks this game feels good
thank you steelers for not giving me a heart attack today

i love you
that should be a safety it hit off him before the endzone
so how is that not a safety he touched it in bounds then downed it in the end zone
wait when he touches the ball isnt it live outside the end zone and then he recovers in the end zone so safety
3 possessions in 7 minutes and only 3 points to show for it come on guys
hey guys is it cool if i watch with yall people are being assholes in my thread
bengal took a knee to the head how hes ok
pray for elbows pray for elbows pray for elbows
if these stupid networks dont stop making a mountain out of a molehill every time ben touches his elbow im going to go insane
this has felt like the longest quarter in history
the announcers are gonna run down on feild and suck off burrow any time now
i love bens deep balls

you know what ill stand by that statement
unstoppable

when we get going
i think that was bens prettiest deep ball all season
im confused what playaction vilma is talking about on that higgins pass
illegal pick but whatever
was that not a pick
thats the legal pick play
this announcer has been all sorts of wrong and its getting really annoying
juujuuuu idk how ben got that off threw it so accurately lets go
dont take ben for granted pittsburgh
hella respect for juju giving a fan the ball
off tackle run from the shotgun loses 6 yards

fichtner ill fuckin do it again
passing is working

lets run a stretch play and lose 5
that was big them not getting any points before the half
tj is killing it diontae is feasting more than fasting and large benjamin is doing work i love it so far
it really annoys me that he keeps calling him schuster juju smithschuster smitchschuster or just juju but never schuster idiot
chase claypool just scored from the heinz red zone we too can score big with heinz thick and rich ketchup from our local giant eagle
starting to sound like a broken record but claypool is something special
tj shouldve won the award last season
geez did this announcer put like 50 grand on the bengals or something
vilma out here shamelessly rooting for the bungles lmao
mccloud is such an 200 iq returner
lol fuck the bengals they were talking mad shit before this game acting like they are actually on our level forgetting that we have beaten them the last 10 times hopefully those dumbass fans learn there lesson after this game that they will never be on our level
my lack of chest pains right now is odd
teams from ohio and roethlisberger shitting all over them name a more iconic duo
anyone who says we arent a top 2 team in the nfl or dont have a shot at the sb is plain incorrect were incredible

honestly why the fuck did they even have joe still in hopefully hes ok
bengals pls pull burrow he doesnt need this abuse hes going to be good for you guys dont let him get hurt for nothing
post game thread
imagine being a bengals fan
ben what if i throw the ball really fucking hard
so if power doesnt come back i will have to resort to getting shitfaced in my car in order to charge my phone to keep the stream up

this is the way
please can we make a rookie qb look like a rookie qb today

bengals had a 3 and out

x200b

no no they didnt get some better announcing here
yo my toupe just blew across the field
how was that not a safety
lmao i love how they wont even show the replay to see if it was actually a safety
announcers just going to ignore not telling us why that wasnt a safety lol
aj green and fitzgerald have to be the best receivers held back by the teams they were on


edit how could i forget calvin
is it me or does the offense lock onto one wr to start the game lately
lol chase says yeah take it back to the 5 instead
lmao claypoolima give that punt an extra couple yards
lmaoooooo claypool
lets go boys defense and special teams are gonna have to step up today make this a game of field position
ben out front blocking


where are my rosary beads
ben rubs his elbow every damn week
man its so fucking refreshing to see a completion in a deep ball holy fuck
claypool plz be ok
please be ok cc
cmon chaseshake it off buddyplease
f in chat for claypools playtools
ben trusts dobbs more than his oc
the defense has been saving their power
sutton with the shortest redemption arc in history
we just not gonna do anything on these turnovers huh
man id kill for a 2015 deangelo williams right now
the fact that we cant run on 3rd and 2
bengals fan made a post about putting the terrible towel in a urinal this loss is gonna be on him
aaaaaaargh why are they running conner east and west
i can not stand stats like that to margin stat of fucking course its better in wins than in loses no fucking shit they are very highly correlated that stat means nothing
on the flip side berry has been punting really well
3 points off 2 turnovers i know were 80 but thats just really frustrating
yo offense wake the fuck up
alright randy can you pretty please challenge these 5th string corners
ben got a roughing the passer call brb going to check outside for pigs flying around
juju have my babies
thats vintage ben there
when ben plays like this we look like an 80 team
its so annoying that the bengals finally have a good quarterback
lol vilma just bodied that guy i dont care if youre a good backup if you were good youd be the starter
ebron has been the receiving te we thought ladarius green was going to be
i dont blame conner i blame our run block
minkah making a play that wont show up in the box score
tj fucked their field goal chance all up lol
bengals thread is so mad right now lmao
anyone elses game thread stuck on a bos pat
why does this color commentator hate the steelers so much lmao he keeps bringing up how many yards they gave up on the ground to the ravens
man joe haden is the fucking man one of our best fa signings ever
ayyy got a yard from the run game better than usual
tua herbert burrow thats a pretty good class of rookie qbs gotta wonder would you rather be playing and living in la on a scrub team and living in miami or on a scrub team and living in cincinnati
tj can do it all
are they seriously showing us a fucking ad when the ball might have come out
madness going on on the field lets hear from lowes right now
juju haters are not having a good time tonight
yo its 7 pm eastern and the 4th quarter hasnt started yet i hate these afternoon games
lmao that cartoon of ben with the super huge james harrison arms makes me laugh when ever they show it
bens just practicing now
that second effort by juju
sucks to not be sure you can run for 1 yd
thats some cool history on spillane
bungles blaming the refs in their sub fucking hilarious
mason rudolph is our human victory cigar
moving forward the steelers should be throwing the ball to set up the run not the other way around randy needs to stop trying to run the bill cowher offense its not going to work well with this team we have a hall of fame qb who is still playing at a pro bowl level along with a really solid young receiving core thats been getting better every week the offensive line seems to be a much stronger pass blocking unit as well i hope randy is able to figure all of this out before we get into the playoffs
no idea why this thread got stuck have to go check some logs
i dont know who the bengals backup is but put him in and save your franchise
solid game good night all
damn haden is blanketing dudes today
just about time to go pickup chinese food and keep this streak going
james conner looks lost every time we call an outside run
maybe dont start conner so far back on every single play
fg scaring me wind has definitely caught a few balls
we need to establish the run this wind is coming in huge gusts and aint gonna let up glad we have berry to boom kicks like that last one i am real surprised they tried this last one with bos and even more impressed he nailed it holy hell
praise be that was an elite kick in this wind
3rd downs are either how much you wanna bet i can throw this over those mountains or how many people do you think connor can run through by himself on this screen
is that not a safety touched it outside the endzone
how is it not a safety
that ball hit him thats a safety
im confused how is it a touchback
why is that not a safety
hello isnt that a safety
were all happy to have alualu back
i love this defense so god damn much
jesus christ these bengals are so undisciplined
this is the weirdest game
anyone else ever think about how nice is it to see a former divisional opponents best player join us and then just be awesome for years haden is honestly one of my all time favorite steelers over the years
im tired of jc dunno about you guys
1st and 20 we just got stuffed on the run and fichtner calls another run play

fucks sake man
come on diontae we know youre better than that
berry is earning is job back
alrighty tj its about fucking time you get a strip sack you are overdue on the season
did claypool just down the ball and try to throw it further back
vance was never a major star but ive alway liked seeing him play hope hes back soon
we acting like ben is literally made of glass
4 possessions good field position 6 points not great
cant run on alualu
alualus effect on the run defense looks nice so far
deep ball unlocked
thats a long johnson
james fucking washington
td
be ok chase
oh chase please be ok
damn what a drive i was seriously starting to doubt our offense but they just shut me up
my boy clay be good please
im usually a fan of being aggressive but im not a fan of going for 2 on that one take the points in all of this wind
hopefully claypool is fine
52 minute 1st quarter wtf
dammit sutton you were gonna be the affordable resign this year
bengals have kicked themselves in the foot

nah they missed their foot and kicked themselves square in the dick its actually kind of impressive
im happy with the score especially considering the conditions but man conners patient running game is not working rn
what is up with the number of batted down passes this year
what on earth is chuks doing you cant just let your man stand there and get up to deflect that pass you have to engage him
is it just me or has ben had way more balls tipped at the line this season
for being 65 ben sure has been getting a lot of passes batted down this season
i hope to god that ben will start calling the plays the rest of the game randy is ass
glad were winning these announcers are terrible i hate getting the crap crews
gotta love the watt subway commercials mom knock it off
i love when someone tries to push watt he just puts their hand down for them
why is our pass rush nonexistent
if he squares up and moves into him to initiate how is it not opi
thats a fucking pick
the drive we switch to zone instead of man and they pick us apart we rush 3 instead of 45 can we just stick to our strengths and what works butler
did they change the rule about using the goalpost as a prop or was that ref just watching the bengals commit a penalty and not care
these commentators are absolutely gagging on the bengals dicks
its better to be lucky then good wtf is this dude saying
fucking ben wow

gonna really miss him when hes gone
what a find boswell was he was like the 4th kicker we had the year we got him
that is insane confidence in the pocket what an absolute dime from ben
seems like we score at least 1tdgame off of a long pi call forced by claypool easy to forget about those yards but theyre just as good as receptions
bens been much better since he got dinged up
are we gonna pressure burrow so far hes had a completely clean pocket
lets get some qb pressure plzzz
i was told there would be sacks
tj god damn wattttt
ebron is fucking huge for this offense
jonathan vilma is in shambles that no one is establishing the run
the james conner special
run the ball up the middle why do we keep running east and west like were playing college ball
i am so fucking tired of randy fichtner why do you not take the couple yards on second down wtf literally anyone with any football knowledge would call better plays
bosgod laughs at flags and eats them for breakfast

its not really healthy but we cant stop him
lil john voice tj whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
how does watt end up in the full nelson every game and no call
didnt realize how big tj was until i saw that gatorade bottle look like a fucking baby bottle in his hands
alright we double the next half we win 4414
burrow already having a rough day out there and still a whole half left with a defense that is only just getting started
bingo bango bongo the bengals gonna bungle
a 5 win team might make the playoffs

o lord
i lift weights
aaah the good ole try to run off the clock with 30 minutes left in the game
fuckkkkkkkk randy fichtner
berry seems quite improved from last year
when requesting snell instead of conner please remember the fumbles
new berry old berry
we have a stacked wr core athletic te and a hof qb wish we would throw when up and bury bad teams instead of playing uber conservative
very slow game
fuck fox and these commercials
fucking lowes commercial during a pivotal moment
mapletron
imagine being a bengals fan and thinking you coulda won this game
vilma shut the fuck up
ben going for 400 and 4 tds unless they bring rudolph in lol
aj green is in this game
tj houshmanzadeh cursed this franchise against the steelers
vilma talks about him playing and being drafted in the first round every chance he gets lol relax bro we know you played
anyone know if vilma was drafted same class as big ben or not i cant remember
ben is throwing the fuk outta the ball calm down bb
theyve gotta get that connection going at some point i feel like ben always misses claypool there
look i know our run game sucks but can we at least run a few plays to chew some time off the clock
watching juju get tackled and 5 steelers by his side picking him up immediately makes me happy
have yall heard that ben only went to team facilities to get his daily covid tests theyve only said it about 15 times so far
bengals fans getting mad that the announcers are saying this is practice for big ben cause their team cant show the fuck up
where are snell and mcfarland at running game aint shit give em a shot
this is the best game jordan berry has had in a long time
kinda feel bad for aj green man its sad to see a legend decline despite being such a huge rival
mccloud
all ive heard this year is how amazing burrow is looks pretty ass today
this is exactly what my heart needed this week
ray ray is gonna return a kick before this season is over
burrow looks like he pizzad when he should have french fried
is it just me or has berry been killing it since his resigning
rudolph time
games over now time to go watch spacex take off t minus 7 minutes in case you guys didnt know
we should save burrows from cincy and have him as our backup lol
claypool is so fucking good made up for his missed catches today
vilma is not hip
only the bengals would put their fake punt on film during garbage time
ladies and gentlemen its rudolph time
been a strange game i havent been able to feel my heartbeat in my eyeballs even once
what a catch by hopkins
holy fuck arizona
so the packers saints ravens chiefs

the only other 4 teams with 2 losses or less
wtf is going on with the broadcast right now they had the camera on tomlin for 2 minutes while they were talking about nothing
i have to be honestl drank just a little too much and dozed off for a few minutesis ben ok i kind of think that they put rudolph in because the game is out of reachbut just want to make sure
ben looking like a snack in that graphic
burrow back outnot smart
ok boys signing off as usual enjoyed the hell out of bantering with yinz 90
they really should pull burrow we have been getting pressure with second stringers in there theres no need to keep him in there and risk the future of the franchise
i know the game is a forgone conclusion but watching back up d players come out and keep feasting is awesome to watch
bruh kyler murrays bomb to hopkins was insane
you know youre a steelers fan when a 297 lead still isnt enough to unclinch your cheeks
stop running a fucking outside run randy its not fucking working
i dont knowcare if it is conner or the oline responsible for the terrible run game what i do know is that he cannot get any yards running outside put derek in and go up the middle
can we stop using that stretch play please thanks
i really hate vilma hes been so fuckin biased so far
there we gono 1st possession 3 and out
why does he keep saying three and out the steelers picked up a first down
bozgawd
what a garbage camera work
ben didnt practice all week didnt expect a fast start
the wind is no match for bosgod
if youve lost the endzone you can look and you will find him bosgod will be there
how do we not get points from that
that was a safety wtf he touched it
who welcomes burrow to the afc north first

my money is on watt
man i forgot aj green was even still in the league
they need to tie a string on that ref hes going to blow away
lol wow bungles looking super prepared out there
im already very thankful our games are rarely on fox
does conner have eyes y
great hands diontae
this offense is really frustrating
claypool making the big plays moving that ball back two yards
the offense will awaken sooner or later just wait
the run blocking has been abysmal for most of the season but some of the blame has to go on conner and the playcalling as well conner doing way too much dancing and the insistence on running these zone runs to the outside when conner doesnt have the speed to beat people to the edge is simply baffling
haden balling out so far today
big ben blocking qb
ben was like imma block imma block fuck that
lmao ben leading the blockers that was hilarious
bungals fans will say that was a dirty play by connor
damn tumble weeds going across the field
conner doesnt even try to avoid tacklers lol he just puts his whole body down and goes down
i really dont want to see rudolph in unless hes taking a knee at the end of the game with the lead
i had surgery on my foot and have screws in it if it get stepped on im in crippling pain for a few minutes i would expect any surgical area to be sensitve forever
playing the steelers twice will drop that yardage
ill allow those underneath passes all day
defense doing their job wake up offense
imagine being a bengals fan
this game is gonna last til 8 if we keep this pace up lol
this drive is exactly why you dont give up on dj after an early drop
damn i thought johnson was killing us guys
get well claypool we need you
oh no no no no
please dont tell me claypool is injured
hes just winded i reckon give him a minute should be fine i hopeee
i wonder if he smashed his nuts he was getting up like he got sacked
i just want a burger and fries dominos
i get being up 14 but its the fucking first quarter just kick the ball unless it was suddenly gusting bad enough that even the extra point was sketchy
bengals really look like theyre half assing it
still waiting on that first sack to keep the streak going
the defense reacted immediately to the audible lol
fummmbllllllllle
ripped that shit out like a beyblade
how many times are we going to run that stretch play and lose 5 yards
cam sutton is a strip sack artist how many is that now geez
i hate randys calling so much you can tell when the dude some kind of sweep or some shit
im tired of fichtners dumbass run it on first and 10 and get stuffed scheme
its only the end of the first gta vi is gonna release before this game ends
bengals kicked themselves in the foot

jonathan vilma

lol
if connor is gunna run it cant be to the outside
lol911 only disaster they havent had yet is an alien invasion
i live for silently watching the bengals game thread comment meltdown its one of my favorite bengals vs steelers traditions as of recent
jersey shore family vacation sounds like the absolute worst possible thing to ever go on television
2020 the year of the knock downs for ben
05 on third downs

alright defense youre up
every time washington gets the ball im all smiles
more turnovers than first downs

gotta love that
x200b

that was less than optimal
how on earth and higgins be that wide open
how is a tb tampa team gonna get crushed 383 by no at home but a depleted sf team stays ahead of no in the superdome
jonathan vilma can eat a whole bag of dicks
haden playing a game coverage today
better move the ball on offense here no stupid run plays
hey defense you should get a sack

haha jk

unless
just a reminder that vilma was drafted 1 pick after ben
claypool is a pi generating machine and i love it
our receivers are really letting ben down today
how the fuck did that ball get to juju
when the steelers score i say yes
juju all day baby
large benjamin
i cant stand vilma announcing this youd think we were losing and 08 according to him
thats a big juju in the stands there
sack this fool
stop playing base defense against 11 personnel
burrow has like 2 good throws and you guys start freaking out we are ok guys promise nice sack by tj by the way
ben should never have to practice again
need at least 20 point lead at the half to feel comfortable
just imagine if we were catching all of these passes hitting players hands we would be unstoppable
everything is great except those stupid outside runs
jc running laterally is gonna give me liver failure
connor aint great but these calls are leaving him in a terrible situation
youre welcome everyone i traded diontae johnson in fantasy this week and by law every move i ever make is the wrong one im ok with this
run game fucked our whole drive
whole drive ruined because of randys dumb fucking shotgun outside run thanks a lot you stupid fuck
conner averaging five yards per carry today wait a minute what do you mean sideways yards dont count
alright need out 1 defense to step up here
holding on tj
tj watt getting held every play as usual
beautiful shot of tj in a choke hold
totally not holding tj right there nope wasnt hanging on him at all it was just defensive hugging the refs probably
this game is great so far but this season especially we seem to be jekyll and hyde with our halves hope we retain our dominance and finish them
how great would tj watt be if they started calling all the holding penalties against him
lol just a play to get burrows numbers up
dont ever disrespect this d they come to play every time its important
pretty good first half all in all still room for improvement though it would be nice to get the run game figured out so we can grind them down in the 2nd half
i wanna win terrys money
should we run up the score because fuck the bengals
so weird looking at the stands and seeing them so empty goes for any team fuck this virus so hard
haden is having himself a ballgame
haden has been killin it today
god damn i love joe haden
have a game haden
what steelerformer steeler hurt jonathan vilma so bad
imagine if we started calling simple runs instead of these slow developing outside zones
we should run 2 straight plays thats sure to fool em
is it me or is johnathan vilma the biggest tool everything is all about him and he sounds so cocky when he talks man i would hate to hang out with that guy
whos ready to be super conservative and blow this game like we almost did against philly and tennessee
run run pass thatll fool em
ive talked a lot of shit about berry but hes been money these last two weeks
did berry get laid great punt
im sure glad the ad is way more important than a possible turnover in the game
might be a turnover

commercial
theres not enough commercials during an nfl game gotta throw some in during it
power running with conner who would have thought
ben thinks all the wrs are 72
touchdown chase claypool
claypool is a god damn monster
claypool is the greatest wr in nfl history
one of these days i will learn what blue 80 means
now time for another tj sack get him leading the nfl
we need to keep this corp for years idfc
that pump fake is overpowered lol
claypoooool my man once he starts consistently catching these balls in traffic watch out
ugh theyve got us right where they want us up 22 with 4 min left in the third were playing right into their hand
the big ben being a weakness narrative dying in a fire today and rightfully so the dumbest thing ive ever seen
now bens just gotta get washington a td
bengals fans wishing for injuries on ben smh
defense played shitty last week to honeypot burrow into thinking he was gonna eat this week wow tomlin really playing 4d chess
the bengals twitter post shitting on the terrible towel is clearly showingteams still dont learn the curse it carries
this commentarys career highlight was being drafted in the same year as ben
no heart attacks so far i like that
did yall know vilma was in the same draft class as big ben
washington is probably a wr2 on a lot of teams we have the best 4 wr sets in the nfl
fitzpatrick so close on that pick
hey guys im just posting to let you all know that vilma was drafted in the same class as ben thats a fun fact that you probably havent heard today
is it just me or is this game d r a g g i n g
what are they talking trash about

been asking myself that about the bengals fans all week
its 7 oclock and theres still another fucking quarter to go
games like this make me remember how much i wish ben could run
fuck drafting a receiver in the 1st round

the pittsburgh steelers organization
surely ben will connect with claypool on one of those sideline passes eventually
holy shit stop talking about the saints
is that coach randy with the mask up to his eyebrows lol
juju is hard to tackle

jordan berry is a fucking punter today
holy shit when did berry become good
if only a 1 yard run was something we could manage
my god thats huge lol
berry on the boswell redemption arc
ray ray
almost reindeer time boys
come on ray ray
mccloud is the pr weve been waiting a decade for
jeez man ray ray is long overdue for a td
god i hope we can give juju the money he wants
if ray ray isnt an allpro this year we riot
can we pull starters at this point i dont want people to get hurt
who dey the guys getting their asses kicked
the bengals really thought they could win lmao
4 td lead time to call off the dogs and see what mason rudolph has well see if benny snell football can close too
weve put up 36 points and we cant run the ball worth a damn this is some kansas city shit lol
juju made some fucking plays today nothing super flashy in the stats but he made several first downs and a td of course
ray ray facts he was a star running back in high school

he can throw the ball 60 yards in case we ever want to use him for a trick play
somethings not right theres 10 minutes left in the 4th and im not sat up straight and shaking like a mentalist
footballs only fun when you win

aint that the truth buddy having the time of my life this year
ben is done at least the rudolph flashback to 2019 will not be as painful watching him be a starter as a backup im fine wit dat
what we learned today is that the ravens will always be a tough game but well always put the browns and bengals in their place
prediction mason will throw a 55 yard touchdown to claypool
spillained
why r yall so butt hurt over the announcers every week goddamn they get excited when football plays happen relax
they should of took burrow out the game was over now he is more hurt good job guys
welcome to the afc north joe
soooo they punt faked to get their qb to injure his ankle more uh ok
fyi tj houzyourmama tweeted the terrible towel shoe shine today when will they learn

man if we can just get this offense going this defense is so fucking good

maybe offense will wake the hell up now should have at least 20 points by now
steelers score

fox heres how burrow is best
ben looked great today no lie
the fire tomlin crowd sure is quiet this year
what is this weird feeling no chest pain tachycardia anger this is weird good job boys who dey
fans of other teams dream about winning seasons and playoff appearances

i just want an offensive unit that doesnt start slow 15 games out of 16
whelp turnover wasted because fichtners stupid calls put us in 2nd and 16
break out the nitroglycerin
we need to establish a good run game and not resort to 5wide on every play hopefully having watt back will help
good morning i have to work at our off site storage today my company doesnt allow people to work by themselves so i need to support my colleague while she is on the forklift

i will be watching the game cold sober by myself in a weird warehouse office next to a mulch factory
carson wentz is fucking trash
imagine being a fan of any other team here we go
lfmaooo conner is so slow
cmon conner just run straight and dont hesitate
conner just run the fucking ball stop tip toeing
unable to convert hopefully the wind wont mess with the fg
gotta crank the motor on offense
wizard of boz
its ok guys once we start losing backyard ben will start playcalling
why was that a touchback and not a safety
shouldnt that be a safety
that was def a safety
why is that not a saftey
ball fielded outside the endzone fumbled back into the end zone recovered and tackled whats going on here
why wasnt that a safety
come on lets murder this rookie
praise the legend joseph haden
i want to see big play ray ray take it all the way edit at some point apparently im a few seconds behind lol
our running is piss poor
running on 1st and 20 makes me want to punch a wall
run blocking is not a strength of this offensive line
yikes conner
conner does not have outside speed
quite honestly i think dotson has been playing better than decastro this year specifically on run blocking
damn dj just catch the ball
this game could end 30
maybe next possession the offense will wake up
steelers and slow starts name a better duo
settle down boys this wind is atrocious the ball is gonna be going all over its hard to catch when the ball is moving around
yeah that was very obvious claypool
man i wish we signed bell for that minimum deal like kc did
bens blocking attempt lol
decastro and okorafor just parted the red sea
lol give ben a break guys hes on two bad knees
now this is nfl level playcalling
no injuries
why take a commercial break when he is literally jogging off the field
ben to enron 04
swear to god they fucking know that us fans will always get stressed the fuck out over seeing the slightest bump to bens elbow
thanks for putting that voodoo on boswell ya bastard
mason rudolph has played football before
why do we keep wasting 3rd and 5 by overthrowing deep
announcers really trying to jinx boz hes never missed a kick against cincinnati hes made 22 straight field goals
joe burrow wants to move the ball and wants to win games

wow
i dont want to know about joes open relationship
perfect throw by ben
touchdown
lets gooooo
this is what happens when ben calls the plays
come on chase be ok
that was a good catch by johnson focus had to be on 100 to make that ball was right there
he got the wind knocked out of him hopefully
the ground made a needed adjustment on his elbow
chase no please be okay
that was some drive if ben can connect that deep ball this offense can do so much more
dionte chase and juju are just incredible to watch
i think he took the pylon to the jewels
think he got the wind knocked out
the wind has pissed ben off and now hes going off
great fucking drive boys
this game wont be over until midnight
lol that looked like me in madden
injury report no 21 mackensie alexander has been taken into the locker room to be evaluated for a possible concussion his return is questionable

looks like they will be playing with 2 cbs the rest of the game
ball ball
pitt had aaron donald jc and boyd they both played big time as freshman in 2013 and won only 7 games

that program is cursed
kicked themselves in the foot
i will give the bungles a bit of credit herethey are doing pretty well against the pass rush burrow i dont thinkhas been hit onceyet
connors vison is his biggest downfall he just cant seem to find that hole
missing vance hardcore rn
4 wr set on 3rd and 2 i guess our own coaches dont trust our run game its that bad
thats like 15 knockdowns this season for ben
wideeeeeeeeeeee open
well that wasnt really fucking cool of our secondary
why tf is tj playing in coverage
thats a pick play
wellfuck
i hate knowing exactly whats coming and watching the defense get roasted by it we always get owned by these rub routes
how is that not a pick
also the non play by play announcer is annoying af
burrows mayfield
pass rush gotta get home
watching on delay these announcers are trash can anyone explain why the muffed kickoff was not a safety hit him in the field of play then recoct in the endzone and forced out of bounds announcers didnt even bring it up
fox sports please stop showing me this picture of what ben roethlisberger would look like in the take on me music video i hate it
announcers always give randy props i really think his play calling is terrible
juju you have redeemed yourself
way to make up for it juju
juju
there we go totally unbiased commentators
claypool good to see hes ok thats our first 3rd down conversion
i like colin cowherd i know sue me but i giggle to myself whenever he points out ya know i think ben is the weak spot on the steelers roster hes done it like three times over the past month
this taco bell commercial is messed up because taco bell has literally annihilated everything good from their menu
throw it to mama bear juju

you love to see that
being in england this game is gonna fuck my sleep up
burrow is gonna be a damn good qb
the sack streak is alive and cooking
watt hasnt done the high kick in a minute he must be excited about that one
i do believe that its dionte johnsons week you just cant cover them allgood problem to have
james conner looks really bad today running to the side and backwards
conner struggling today


keep those legs churning young money


hell break free
put watt in and run it down their throat goddammit


stretch is not working bring derek watt in and go up the middle
dionte hit them with that okie doke
james conner going laterally makes me want to gouge my eyes out
its not even on conner its these shitty outside run playcalls with a back who isnt fast not to mention that side of the line got blown back before he could get around the edge get under the ball put watt in a run that shit north stop with the eastwest calls
i honestly dont think its connors fault the oline is not helping him at all
all i want for christmasssssss is a new oc
retire outside zone and sweep and dont let it appear until next season
instant flag thrown no flag on the play the fuck did they think was wrong
why is boswell such a chad
tj watt literally getting fucking choked
ahh yes lets zoom in on the headlock watt had been in all season
tj watt is my dad
tj watttt
tj im happy you got the sack but maybe dont dance when theyre about to spike it and catch you off sides too close
i hope watt whispered in his ear the rest of your career baby you and me when they were on the ground together
lol mondeaux has a vibe that hair and that little mustache with the pretty flower sleeve
mondo ate that double well done to allow tj up the middle
game breaking play there if they can hold them off here
please dont let them get points
credit to mondeaux on that play
bungals rolling over and showing their belly early i was expecting a closer game
big stop by the defense
strong half

defense stellar outside of a busted play offense woke up looking like a great overall team right now
wow

a first half without any cardiac problems we should do this more often
game ball for haden unless disaster strikes
haden looks like he can play at this level another 35 years
haden came to play today thank you refs for letting them play
thats such great coverage by haden
joe haden is in rare form tonight
i knew when devin bush got hurt our run d would feel it it took time but you can see it now
haden looks 4 years younger on the field today
conner needs to be put in timeout for a few plays
conners definitely getting cut next year
wow our running game is so bad
steelers have no running game none zilch
the good ole run run pass punt
the classic run run pass
a fairy dies every time the steelers run on 2nd and 10
looks like giving berry a few weeks vacation lit the fire under his ass lmaoooo lets go man
incase you missed it james conner had 2 ineffective runs stalling our drive again
no way thats actually berry
lol come on dude you gotta call fair catch on that when the hounds have been released
can someone tell me how the hell we can run the ball against good dlines like the giants and eagles but suck against the 31st and 32nd ranked run defenses in the league
would really like williamson get some run today not sure why he hasnt seen more action to this point
wait runs can go for more than 1 yard pretty sure thats illegal
do the steelers still do play action on offense
watt will never get a call might as well just hold the fuck out of him
how the fuck does this broadcast team not show one angle of the play before commercial
ehhh he kicked up grass lol hes in
fumble lets hear from lowesw
that ten yard opposite hash mark out route throw is exactly why ben is a franchise qb
that 11 yard run felt like a 30 yarder lol
ben is just playing madden
nearly doubled our run yardage with an 11 yard play lol
no qb has a better pump fake than our very own ben roethlisberger
ben broke that dudes ankles with the pump
bens gonna be like can i just stay at home every week
he literally pumped their linebacker to the ground lmao his pump fakes are always so good and it was to see some more of it this drive i love when he gets the camera man too
i hope we hang 40 on them
we running up the score i guess
stop the count
bengals fan probably
i cant believe were still in the third quarter
just peeked in the bungles sub and their fans are seriously blaming this embarrassment on the refs is there a dumber fan base in the nfl
is that the 4th or 5th time they had to coddle vilma and his draft class next to ben
aj green did not know he was playing
can we get benny snell in rest up james
bungle fans hoping ben gets his knee wrecked what a sad and pathetic team city and fan base
our receivers keep getting separation but he just cant hit em breaks my heart
see flair
if i lick my fingies maybe i do better

j burrow
should we pick up ohio states quarterback this year
how does tj watt never get these holding calls bro im so tired of watching him get mugged
if we score even if its just a fg id say take ben out
bad adjustment there chase that is one you should have had
randy that play was read so fucking hard stop trying to outsmart people you are not smarter than others
berry has been great since coming back
ray ray mccloud hes good
juju is really doing a great job of channeling ward get ball move forward at all cost when not a target what blocking or contribution can i do to help someone else
we fucking hate the browns and the bengals dont we the only games that we trully dominate
i didnt start chase claypool in fantasy ama
can we pls sit ben now
there we go now mason can go in pull as many receivers as possible too dont need to be creating any new abs today
ok i think its time to sit ben for safety
i hope the coaching staff realizes that we are a pass first team by now any success weve had on the ground recently has been set up by gashing opponents in the passing game
someone please send me the video of juju and ebron dancing
i want mason to throw 2 touch downs just because
nice tackle ray ray at least
well guess we had that coming bengals can practice things too
cinci looking to get that touchdown thats worth 30 points
bungals stop trying youre down 29 just take it
why waste a fake play when youve already lost
this jonathan guy has a large boner for the bengals
oh my god bengals youre just going to get your new franchise qb murdered
alright put rudolph in the game lol dont need ben taking unnecessary shots
why do we have tj in there for stat padding
yo im happy we are winning but seeing burrow hurt sucks
bengals are fucking up their qb the same way the colts did
bengals still the bengals
who dey
holy shit d hop
that cards game though
he got off the field fine so hopefully dude is okay you hate to see someone get rolled on like that always scares me
time for benny snell football

here we go baby
can mason throw 18 yards
this snell guy is pretty good
washington football teams super bowl is on 126
why not let rudy try to make something happen the guy needs some confidence and this is the game to get him some
first game in a long time that i havent had incredible stress or crushing chest pains gg especially haden hope he stays on fire
lol everyones blaming the defense like they didnt force 3 straight 3 and outs and a turnover this is on the offense
the bengals subreddit worrying about dirty hits from us as if they arent fans of the team that continued to employ vontaze burfict the dirtiest nfl player of our time after he singlehandedly lost them the wild card game that was their 7th consecutive playoff loss

mind blown
still think that was a saftey
any rules experts know why that wasnt a safety nflcom says it is a safety

when an impetus by a team sends the ball behind its own goal line and the ball is dead in the end zone in its possession or the ball is out of bounds behind the goal line
derek watt is back in now its no excuse for these damn shotgun runs now give conner a fb to run behind
haden looking good so far
lets give it to conner so he can try to find bengal defenders and run into them
juju still real good


still want juju


but also dam diante making some big plays this season
uu mithchuster
3rd and 15 better throw a 2 yard pass
idk about you guys but im terrified of the 18 jags next week
hopefully burrow is okay
piss poor run play ruined the drive
lol bengals sub all crying and calling ben the r word i just couldnt imagine talking that much shit if my team hadnt won a playoff game in 30 years
lets go joe haden
so glad we picked up haden
classic pick play never penalized
cant touch the crossbar on a td celebration wheres the penalty refs
juju is wr1
weathers going to be nuts for this game im hype
are they going to make us watch the end of this windy nightmare in cleveland or is the game going to be aired on time
i know we joke about heart attacks but my sister is an avid runner during the baltimore game her apple watch said her heart rate hit 200 bpm lol
couple passes to start the game just like the opposite of what everybody guaranteed would happen
love me some johnson early in the game
that damn wind he had him beat too
whatre the stats of attempts completions of bens deep ball this season
wind carried it
ben hasnt completed a long pass like that all season stop doing them on 3rd down ffs
benny snell football
lets goooo ultimate fourth down play
that punt counts as a long pass this is still the same drive
lol no need to make first downs if you can force a turnover on a punt
run run pass
fuck it go for it
couldve zoomed the camera out on the fg there fox
obligatory boswell fucks comment
zoom more please
does anyone know how windy it is
great kick especially considering the wind
welp already annoyed with fichtner again
people worrying about the offense now probably shouldnt game today will probably be mostly defensive with the wind and we are much better equipped to pivot to the run
hahahahahahahahahahaha
ball rolls away sadly
my man was so confused
lmao wtf just happened
they are losing their minds in the bengals sub game thread about special teams and it is a lot of fun to watch lol
can someone explain how that isnt a safety
bungles gonna bungle
why was that not a safety is that a rule im not aware of
how is that not a safety
you can tell its windy because of the way it is
how are they not even gonna show a replay of that
they should give the head refs daft punk helmets on windy days like this so they can call penalties
thats the kind of defense we need to keep running passing downs press man and let our d line eat
now heres a team who cant play football jim
im not trying to hate on randy but man itd be nice to have an oc that can call some explosive plays instead of nickel and diming our way to a 4th down
bengals are 29th ranked run defense come on steelers lets get it going
itll be nice to have a real running game again someday
our offense is seriously buns
offense has started like 2 games well this year
what the hell kinda run was that
dj just broke his own ankles and got in the fetal position
this run game needs some serious help man
catch that johnson the steelers needed that and so did my fantasy team
offense struggling early defense doing their job no surprises have my beer in one hand and my blood pressure tester standing by go steeler football
if diontae didnt have stone hands dude would be one of the best receivers in footballwell too bad because he does have stone hands
ben we need you at qb you cannot be lead blocker too
that snap was yikes
run down the clock offense let the defense rest up some so they arent gassed
just keep going north south with connor legit its working he has never been great at designed east west runs use edmonds for those or claypool on that jet sweep design
i wonder how much of the elbow rubbing is soreness or ben just worried about it
bro just get the damn first down jesus
every week its something

i think the announcer just jinxed boswell for later in the game fuck
putting rudolph in would be a surefire way to lose this game
gonna hit the bengals with that classic 2017 chiefs field goal only defeat
do we just not use the middle of the field
i just dont get this playcall at all its not fluid or dangerous at all
are the bengals even trying
what about that deep ball
is that the first deep pass that ben has made this year lmao
we connected on a deep ball guys
who said bens deep ball was gone who said it
strong pass on the wind with dj
lets goo deontae
but but but muh elbow
what a drive
dj caught a pass and ben completed a deep ball
fuck the wind apparently
lets goooo
kick the xp
chase my baby boy nooo
im getting sick by the way of them making a big deal every single time ben touches his elbow it happens every game where they point something about and its always nothing
i am enjoying this game

edit well shit as soon as i say chase is shaken up

fuck
did he catch the pylon to the nads
how the turn tables with dj
remember 6 minutes ago when bens elbow was done lmao
i hope claypool is okay
yesssss
cam sutton a fucking animal
lets go sutton way to bounce back
ugh can we put a fb and just run forward
sutton is based
i love strippers
did vilma just say kicked themselves in the foothow exactly do you do that
lol they kicked themselves in the foot
i was talking shit on sutton for what seemed like a weird tackle but he shut me the fuck up quick
bro they have to put watt in at fullback wtf did you bring in him for if youre not going to use him
how about give snell a chance at a zone run for once instead of running out conner to do the same shit over and over or send either of them on hb dives right into the line lol
i dont sweat when the play breaks down i get excited
imagine if this team had a run game
12 points with 6 drives with great field position we should be up at least 3 possessions without those turnovers were probably sitting on 0 points
no points off turnover there brutal
we still need a sack
thank god for minkahs speed
i have no idea why were content to sit back and rush 4 their ol is terrible and their qb is young force him to speed up his process
at least fitzpatrick was able to catch him
how do you get hit by those 3 guys and not spontaneously explode
alright ben get us some points
what happened to the pass rush
never be flat
textbook pick but okay
literally no point of taking the ball out of the end zone youll hardly ever reach the 25
vilma hes big and tall so his balls dont get batted down

are you commentating the same game were watching
jujus first drop of the year
stop stopping my heart steelers
there ya go juju
good shit juju
juju great catch
juju showing up big time
juju standing there waving his hands wide open
vilma is literally cheering after bengals defensive stops can we replace this guy with a can of soup or something
did claypool call him a bitch lmao
hell of a throw by big ben lets go
great drive ben
ebron mean mugging the fuck out of him in that replay
td juju
jujuuuuuuuuu
always juju always
great fucking throw
yes juju
wow ben looked sacked great play
fuckin classic ben dive into the jaws of the beast to take it down lmao
outstanding from ben
vilma hating more than this thread in the first quarter
that juju celebration was so wholesome i love that guy
ima need to see a sack here soon
pretty sure that was jujus family
time for a sack
i feel like theres gonna be a fight at some point during this game
finally a sack
if our sack streak ends against the fucking bungles ill be very sad lol
did we forget they call us blitzburg light this dude up
teeeeeeejayyyyyyy
tj watt is gonna get your ass its inevitable just accept it
watt weclomes burrow to the afc north properly
tj watt
lol this color guy saying the top teams i the afc north run first has he seen a single one of our games
bearded ben is my favorite ben
that stat was like


wayne gretzky and his brother have more nhl points than any other family
did you guys know this is our best start in franchise history
big ben making sure all the rookies in the afc north can answer who their daddy is and what does he do
lmfaooo ben is torching these guys
i really like diontae johnson
god we cant run the ball
jc needs the day off lol
connor is really not having a great game
if i were to try to tackle dionte i would have two compound fractures at my ankles
these runs just dont work flush that part of the playbook down the toilet please
who the fuck is calling these run plays my god
connor needs to start cutting those up inside
just abandon the run this secondary is doodoo
dont run the ball ever again lol
lets just keep going 5wide all game and keep ben slingin
enough with these shotgun runs for fucks sake
i cant believe diontae hasnt broken 100 yards befire
once again stop calling east west designs for connor that is not his strength he is a north south workhorse and that field is fucking slick from rain today
alright who put that stick of butter on the field not cool
man this run game is legitimately embarrassing not even trying anything new either just the same stretch zone runs that lose 45 yards almost like clockwork
leveon in his prime was something else conners not even close
conner going to have 100 yard gamesideways
why do we keep running outside for a loss
anyone else just see ben say i knew that was gonna happen after that run play lol
connor is not an outside runner please stop scheming him like this randy ffs
bengals defense is hot garbage
looking forward to more mcfarland when he gets healthy
we just hate first downs dont we
we need to find a solution to the running game connor running to the outside is just not cutting it run up the middle or try giving someone else the ball
bosgod
berry showing some pro bowl talent with those fg holds
those suspenders are the real mvp
the return of bosgod 5th most accurate fg kicker of all time
villanueva is a massive human being
yepplay that prevent and let this plug pad his stats
nfl rule book in order to call holding on tj watt he must be held 13 times before a flag can be thrown
tj just took them out of field goal range
arm around the neck holding the collar isnt a hold
hold deez nuts tj watt
i love how the replay shows a hold on tj
tj watt dpoy
tj just mauled that rookie
hot damn gorgeous stunt play there tj
the dline woke up
great half of football boys
fuck the bungles
has avery played at all
god that nfl clothing in the commerical looks cheesy
haden is having a great game
haden having a monster game
did vilma just say bens top receiver today was antonio brown
plz put snell in
imagine if we go up 307 here
run is just not working it seems
our run game is making me depressed
bens been killing it throw the damn ball
3 and out
fuckin randy man lmao
i cant watch james conner run the ball any longer for fucks sake
back to back weeks against bottom feeder dls nothing sigh
cmon get back to being aggressive letting off the gas is how we get burned
cant advance far in the playoffs if you are one dimensional even against the worst of run defenses
its like we just waste every other drive with shit playcalling
ok ive been shitting on you for years but that was a great punt berry
fucking amazing punt
maybe berry taking a couple weeks off was all he needed
there you go
dont see punt returners get slaughtered much anymore but when they do
maybe berry just needed some competition to get it together
james conner runs

everyone knows that when the steelers are playing the definition of a catch becomes very fluid
can this broadcast crew be fired
yeah lets play an ad now
running game is absolutely awful
the claypool jet sweep is becoming predictable
kyler murry lamar jackson
ben is calling the plays
big ebron fan
lol this should be a 500 yard game by ben but randy has to run the ball
this offensive line has sucked for what feels like weeks now i mean why else are we having to throw it 98 of the time
juju is wr 1
conner making positive yards
steelers now entering the heinz red zone
wait wait wait so you are telling me when we pass a shit ton and make the defense guess our running game will open up im shocked randy
oh jeez look what happens when you let conner run down field
perfect pass
the steelers need to forget how to dance and remember how to love
holy hell thats a nice in traffic catch right there
guys are we good
is this enough of a lead for the chicken littles to calm the hell down
lasered that bitch right into to quadruple coverage to find claypool
ben spreading the love juju johnson claypool all having a good day for us fantasy ownerssteelers fans lol
mapletron sends his regards cinci
ben gonna request to not have practice anymore
expected a tighter game but glad i was wrong

9
ben better start getting at least mentioned in the mvp conversation
minkah almost had that
burrows looking shaky
ben running the offense is all we need based off that last drive what tf is the point of randy and his shit calls
rnfl is in shambles seeing there king joe burrow play like shit
still in the 3rd
look at tj watt look at him

b r e a t h e
is it me or is this the longest game ever
ben is having all day to throw
if mason comes ini wont pout
can this guy shut the fuck up about his past and talk about the game
dammit ben you had him
the bengals are a bunch of dickheads not matter their record lmaoo
binces hit was pure afc north football there
that dude almost got  from existence
that hit did not sound pleasant
its insane how sutton isnt even our best slot corner
ben absolutely should win comeback player of the year so far
somebody gonna get hurt going for these balls ben come on keep it tight
blowout trivia dwayne woodruff was the only active nfl player who was also a practicing attorney
claypool with a hammy issue
i love having a really tough receiver again juju really reminds me of hines ward sometimes and he blocks really well like hines did too i hope we can find a way to sign him
ugh lmao
smh cant even run the ball on 3rd and 1
were so bad at the run we need to pass on 3rd and 1
vilma sounds like me on madden lol
berry is having a great game
were talking about sitting guys to save from injury

meanwhile bengals thread is bemoaning the announcers for acting like the game is over
everyone in this sub is bipolar lmao furious when we run the ball and malding when we pass
its finally the 4th quarter boys and girls
im one steelers score from not being able to see the end of this game
goddamn ray ray is slipppyyyy
god damn it hes always so close
mccloud is so fucking good
wow that return boy he makes me hate switzer so much
hes so fuckin explosive its wild when he just decided to go hes at top speed almost instantly
mccloud got a big dick
we luv to shit on division opponents that are orange and start with b
bens not going out until he gets his 4th quarter td
when youre thankful for getting a three yard run thats a bad sign for your running game lmao
gg guys have a good night
do yourself a favor and go to the bungles sub and read the thread the tears are flowing dont be an asshole though
ben throwing it 50 times in a game is insane
i love not having heart attacks on sundays
the way hes throwing a ball to everyone this season

banner 100 would have gotten a catch
4 tds today for the benster
chase is just a touchdown machine lol
remember when people were saying ben was holding us back lol
okay captain fat fuck hang 4 on they head
ok now the game is officially out of reach time to pull the starters
time to bring in red nose
rudolph incoming
this claypool guy is fucking amazing i love him
defense with the great stop mcloud with the huge return juju with the tough third and 7 claypool with the td

like clockwork
90 heisman qbs in afcn
okay juju and ebron stuntin on em
ray ray is a serious weapon in the kicking game he can be a game changer in the playoffs and he seems to get better as the season goes along
undefeated against heisman winners this year
i mean im not happy bout that lol
lmfao that steeler running the opposite way
imagine if devin bush was healthy spillane has been incredible but bush is obviously an incredible player
bungles 012 on 3rd down rn
i mean good job on the bengals for not just giving up completely i guess
defense just wanted more sacks
uh oh we broke burrow
that was alulus sack
spillane for president at this point lol this dude is awesome
jeez tj landing on another ankle
when a meaningless field goal after a fake punt fucks up your parlay
deandre hopkins is a god
nuk is a fucking amazing receiver
bill obrien in shambles watching the end of that cardinals game from the couch
see ya next week ben thanks for a good game
nice run by snell
makes me wonder if we couldve had a good run game the whole time if they used snell more
int pretty sure burrow already felt this loss lol
hopkins is not human
well we secured a winning record lets make it 160
grande benjamin
the steelers havent played a good team s
here we go here we go here we go steelers here we go pittsburghs going to the super bowl
there is too much negativity
can we just all agree cbs has better production than fox
how was that not a safety on our kickoff after we scored the fg the ball hit the returner in the field of play then the ball went in the end zone he got tackled in the end zone how is that not a safety
wtf is this run offense looks like they never played before with each other
are we going to win 30
mccloud rides the wind
dont forget guys ben hurt his elbow last year so if he touches it it probably means hes hurt
how the fuck do you not know burger king has breakfast its not like they just added it
ok allalau has helped out the run d but lets be real bush was the key i think
honest question is there an offense as conservative as the steelers when we have a lead like we look like a bunch of pussies and its so fucking annoying
i think id give ben the 4th quarter off let the old man rest
even though its not exactly connecting right now im glad to see ben throwing deep
snell just feels like hes faster like instead of conner who looks like an 82 snell is like an 88 or something enough to make some progress
this is bens flu game shame to waste it on the bengals
might be time to move on from conner
wtf is conner doing
haden has really become a quintessential steeler love that guy
bens so slow lmaooo
playing with backup fucking cbs and ben has been killing them stop calling fucking run plays randy idgaf if we pass every down if it works dont fucking stop
there was one blown coverage that drive im not worried just a fluke
fine his ass disgusting behavior from the bengals in our house s
walmart showing us how they are profiting from people being stuck at home ah the holidays
aaaand the conner special
okay can we stop complaining now we are up two scores at halftime against a division rival in an nfl game
just took a glance at the rbengals and holy hell there is nothing but cancer and herpes over there
yall want to know why teams always come back against us its because we play so fucking conservative when we have a lead and give it right back to the opponents offense we have to be more aggressive when we have a lead or we are going to blow one when it matters most
damn i missed the big ben pump fake hasnt used it a bunch lately but its still the best in football
i actually really like burrow i hope he can continue to grow and so does our rivalry
prayers up to burrow i really like the dude
hopefully burrow is okay
steelers have 1 less win than the nfc east
the panthers definitely arent gonna come back but they just sacked brady on 3rd down and any time brady gets sacked its a time for celebration
anyone at the stadium can tell me how the weather wind is forecast didnt look too good
ok ive got about 45 minutes of normal heart rate left before the game time to prepour the victory misery shots
my heart is not ready yet
come on duquesne light lets get the power back on in time for kickoff
my sunday ticket feed is music anyone elses
as is tradition polamalu jersey on minkah jersey on the wall renegade blasting lfg
no other fan base i would rather be stressed with than yall lets fucking destroy the bungles today
dude can someone give me a solid stream for this game crackstreams has fucking ice skating on im about to pop off right now
im just thankful we dont have to hear joe buck i was expecting him to be commentating
two afc teams on a fox broadcast is weird
here we go expecting a tough game cincy has been competitive
ok there we go
hopefully vilma is better than he was during eagles game
steelers will receive to open the game

here we gooooo
dont be a trap game i beg you lfg
i think the high winds might actually help us today given that the bengals strength is through the air and they still dont have mixon back from injury yet
another week another heart attack lets go
ive got the defib on hand lfg
lets go man please win big for once
good screen
how bout not throwing lobs in strong winds
really quiet crowd right now fucking idiot
clutch st play
wind stole that one
benny snell football
jordan fuckin berry got in the pile for a second there
we meant to do that it was just a special play
conner does better when he doesnt pull a lev bell stop hesitating so much my dude
no mans land is gonna be deeper this game we need to be efficient on offense
the wind is not fun
are these plays scripted
nice camera work jagoffs
it looks so fucking windy
offense needs to tighten up but turnover converted to points is what we love to see
anyone get the idea that vilma doesnt care for the steelers
honestly i thought the playcalling was good thats mostly on ben and the blocking
why is this on fox
connor has looked like hes overthinking things midplay for a few weeks now keeps hesitating instead of committing to a hole
at least the hail stopped for the game
lol the bungles
drop it again
safety
jesus lmao ball blown off the tee is hilarious
well oiled machine these bengal special teams
i dont like the fox announcers
i think the wind might be a factor today
that touched him out of the endzone right
i feel like the bengals should have 3 points after that
man cant even hear the refs lol
so holding against the steelers d is now not a penalty anymore
ok 3 and out defense nice
this game is going to be as slow as that browns game i can feel it
brooks and allen out there on that 3rd down play
wow the bengals really suck
fine him
please score 7 now playing with a solid lead in this condition would be huge
man i miss having a running game
outside run to start it off i am shocked i tell you
why cant we run the football
sub conner out
inverse holding
put mcfarland in
another drop for dj
i miss heath miller
fox is fucking trash i wish every game was on cbs
just glad we didnt turn the ball over there this games going to be like 137 and wouldnt be surprised if a pick 6 or special teams play decides it
anyone else surprised to see brooks getting so much playing time
i ray ray
fox mccloud is gonna go all the way with one of these returns soon you can just feel it in the gdiffuser
i really hope they can resign mccloud for cheap because i really love how he plays i know he had issues holding onto the ball everywhere before us but hes looked super solid and reliable so far that was 100 dead with a fair catch with switzer but ray ray got a good return out of it anyway
please put the ball in the hands of someone explosive for the love of god
ben with the business decision block
ben got tired
ben really just stopped in place
ben with the read option
that last play made me giggle like a school girl
conner built different
ben sure cant run like he use to
dont the bengals only have like 3 available cbs this game
ben ill give you my elbow
not that right elbow why do all my hopes and dreams lie on an elbow
i cant stand these commentators bringing up bens elbow every goddamn week
boz mvp
bosgod fears no wind factor


bosgod works in mysterious ways
slow start was expected after a week with shitty circumstances
im pretty sure wincing is bens resting face at this point
not getting tds is going to hurt us later in the game
does every game have a ben elbow watch jesus
bos 21 bengals 10 my final score prediction
these mayfield commercials are so stupid
we take end zone shots way too often on 3rd and mid to short remember that happened a lot in the 2nd half of the titans game
thats the deep balls i wanna see
beautiful
the craziest thing is this wind is insane throwing a bomb like that is insanely impressive
james washington runs like a damn running back lmao
beautiful
finally
ez touchdown boys
good throw and catch
dj caught one

ben hit a long ball

what is going on
am i the only one who clenches and tightens up when ben throws the deep ball
yessssssssssss
our wideouts 14 are the deepest in the league man our 4th best dude is good as shit i love these guys
lets go boys
looked like he was surprised that the pass was there glad he pulled it in
lets go
lol barely saw it
wind doesnt affect bens bullets
lets go td dionte
why throw a fade if youre gonna go for two
wind be damned
damn we smoked them that drive
bens deep balls and johnson are looking good today
chase please be ok
01 offense empty set ben calls the shots unfortunate but thats all that works
ben faking a injury is like when lewis hamilton on team radio goes my tiers are finished then turn to god mode
i hope was just landing on his hip vs landing with arm extended and it be the shoulder
i think they told burrow to just get rid of the ball dont let tj smell you
bosgod has made 24 straight fgs and thats the longest active streak in the nfl as per bill hillgrove
whoops
jesus spillane that was one of the most obvious ones ive ever seen lol
fumble
lfg boys
nice strip
2nd of 6 turn overs
gimme dat
lets goooooodoodododorotothsverbdbd
tyler boyd is a big strong maaaan
hahahaahah bungles r dog shit
cam sutton said gimme
rip conner
kicked themselves in the foot
holy shit what a clean strip lmao
im goin to say cam sutton has been legit with the opportunities he has been givin
jesus this is a high school game basically
how is this team so bad at blocking for the run conner is almost always getting hit behind the line
our run blocking is so ass
these run attempts are absolutely brutal
kicked themselves in the foot
boy i sure love that they keep running the same hideous power runs and getting destroyed over and over again
this run game is trash oline has really regressed this year
ben getting warm curtains for the league when this happens
all day to throw
well my heart came to a full stop on that one
berry good
ben needs to throw some more pump fakes to avoid the passes getting batted down imho
wait you dont have to just fuck around in the backfield
anyone else think its a total fucking dick move that ads try to hijack your inhome ai

i dont even use that sort of stuff and i find it annoying as hell like imagine if an ad just opened google and looked shit up
dl not getting enough pressure for me they need to send another guy
damn classic slant td
i was hoping for a sack but ill take a throw away so they settle for a field goal

or we can let them score on 4th down
time for the offense to look alive
fuck off
its benny snell football time
never seen anyone love anything as much as burrow loves licking his hands
juju
thats good juju
i dont really agree with that penalty tbh but ill take it
dont rough up ben unless you want him to do even better
personal fouls and bengals name a better duo
wrapping claypool up because you cant handle him
knock knock knockin on bungles door
claypool draws insane contact i swear he is owning these rookies
very nice of the bengals defense to help us march up the field this drive thanks bengalbros
i know its vilmas first year but he makes me miss chris simms and i dont like saying that
just plain do not want to run power brought watt on for that fuck this play calling
jumbo package lol
sam hubbards face was more apologetic than argumentative i think it was a case where he knew he fucked up hell when he was lying on his back he was grabbing his helmethe knew he drew the flag
juju
i dont know why but that pass scared the shit out of me
and thats just one reason why were the best in the league
i thought that was a terrible pass when it left his hand glad i was wrong
respect my quarterback
juju for the win
he just did that he just did that
this mfer just said that dpi play was a smart play by the defender yeah brilliant to give your opponent a new set of downs on the 5
ben roethlisberger is a big maaaaaan
what a fucking throw
lets gooooo juju
my stream is like 3 years behind the actual game i see juju comments from 5 minutes ago nice td anyway
okay so can we start seeing some pressure from our dline
is that mason rudolph sitting in the stands
juju scores


give ball to fan


mark madden punching the air
kenny albert is worse than every cbs playbyplay announcer
lol i guess its too much to ask the broadcast to recognize jujus parents
everytime the ref turns on his mic i think my door blew open
there it is streak intact
theres my sack
cook his ass tj
diontae johnson is good at football
joe burrow is learning the hard way lol
dread it run from it tj watt arrives in the backfield all the same
diontae having a day today
that ebron route wouldve literally killed heath at that speed
this is a 90 team
ebron
did the bengals just forget about diontae on that play
he just keeps talking about how the successful afc north teams can run meanwhile we have 200 passing yards and like 30 rushing yards maybe stop talking about it
stop running east to west
ben is fucking slinging that ball
for literally one second i thought ebron broke something and i got scared
deonte is a fucking stud
bens on pace for 55 freaking throws this gamethis run game needs figured out
dj is fucking on it today
johnson is already over 100 yards today god damn
im so done with these connor stretch runs
put benny in man
james conner is just a false start penalty back us up another five yards
joe burrow looks like pennywise the clown without makeup
man connor needs to learn to cut up field and take a yard over these 5 yard losses where he runs backwards to get around a block
this isnt just conners fault yall their dl is swallowing us
drive was going great then a shit run to the outside just let ben throw 60 times a game its our best shot
this running gameno words actually
why not just run up the middle with conner
you knowmaybe let conner run it up the middle
hey so maybe try runs that arent lateral 5 yards behind the line of scrimmage
run game sucks but lateral runs def aint it
conner when given an option or zone takes it outside 910 times and it almost never works
see see these shittt runs just give ben more space to throw all part of the plan boys
lets let connor the slower of the backs to try and run outside the tackles and then let little snell be our short yard down back what is that logic
why do we not have snell in there 50 of the time
im gonna go to the steelers bench and rip every running play out of that playbook
boswell is just fucking automatic
shout out to bosgod for kicking 33 in a tornado today
our guys just smacked heads there hayward looking jarred
how do they not call that hold on watt all year long
ugh cmon call something aggressive
im confused offensive lineman allowed to wrap their arms around defensive players throats
whats up with the holding on watt
burrow didnt tried the experience of an interception today he should try now
this soft ass coverage makes me wanna throw up
mondeaux does not make me comfortable
how is that not called a hold every time
watt saved points if our d can stop them on 3rd
huge sack
i wish tj would tell at a red every once in a while hes being put in a fucking sleeper hold and it doesnt matter
hell yea we needed that boi
every time my stream freezes the bungles do something big and its pissing me off
wooooooo tj my man
lmao that was a classic bungles play
very solid half of football
good half despite the shit play calling hopefully we can replicate the defensive success and let ben call some plays in the second half
dae tomlin should be on the hot seat for taking this long to go 80


s
uhhh why isnt tj in
way to wrap it up haden
joe haden is a great tackler for a db
haden having himself a game
haden is an animal
outside run for a loss time
run run pass punt
our run blocking is terrible
fuck the run game its not working throw the ball
we love not converting dont we
beautiful fucking punt
run run pass should be our nickname
that was a nice hit off the punt
best kick of his career
its actually unbelievable how bad the run game is
beautiful punt beautiful tacklewell done
very pleased with berry since his return
911 yes i just witnessed a murder
not sure why were still trying to run the ball so much weve had like one good run all game our passing game has been far better
i think he caught it
falcons sub gotta be the only other team to act like us when we in the lead lmfao
thats a catch
thanks for all the replays fox
that ball bobbles big time he got the toe dragged but he never has full possession
two great replay angles thus far
seems like a catch to me unless they say he didnt have control for the first foot
ball moved a lot but then this is the nfl and no one knows what a catch is
honestly at this point i dont think i know what a catch is
did anyone ever explain why the play from the first half was not a safety

because he touched the ball in play outside of the end zone and then had to go into the end zone to get it and got tackled i thought it would be a safety

can someone explain it to me just so i understand

thanks

finally a steeler game that i have not had to take any tums

go steelers
he got one foot in then he adjusted and got the other foot in i dont think its a catch
im cool with whatever
fox is almost as bad as espns nfl coverage almost
a potential turnover and fucking fox has a commercial on
and now this from lowes
these first down play calls are abysmal
stop running the fucking ball its not fucking working

get randy the fuck away from this team please
please for the love of all that is fuck stop running on first and 10
first down baby

alright ben you can have your superbowl but well have to have two terrible running plays every set of downs

nfl probably
stop askimg about the run game we dont need it
vilma is so annoying we heard you the first fifty times
likeimagine not having ben this yearholy shit what a waste it would be with this d
eazye with the catch
this fucking announcer is aggravating hes done nothing but talk shit on our offense not being good enough to beat good defenses we literally just beat the ravens
man ebron have saved our bacon a few times
remember all those colts and lions fans saying ebron cant catch
ebron only has 2 catches but both were big time 3rd down conversions
ebron the type of dude to drop a 2 yard pass but make the hardest catches
god that first huge touchdown for claypool this year has led to me expecting it to happen more and my balls are blue for it
so happy with ebron this year can live with a drop here and there for his production great signing
that spin was fucking smooooooth
vance better be available for the baltimore game cannot run anything outside with him not setting the edge
god this camera work is fucking terrible
wow a rare running gain nice
what a throw and catch
conner checked this thread at halftime haha
james channeling his inner mendy with that spin
air canada
too easy
is there a better pump fake than ben
bengals sub is about as positive as our running game
i think this claypool kid might be good at football
the guy who sells me my heart attack pills is furious right now
mapletronnn
the combat catch
maple leafs out for ya boi
mapletron
we are seeing tonight why we are undefeated we are a good team when we do what we have to do this game has been our best game in a while
maybe everyone panicking when we tried that two point conversion was overreacting
mapletron k enjoy drinking the rest of this game away nation its over
bengals how are we gonna get out of this hole

taylor well dig our way out

steelers scores

taylor not like that dig up stupids
s kid predicted that td in his pregame analysis
chase claypool is such a beast goddamn
let us thank the bengals for a less than usual stressful week of steelers football
bengals giving every steelers fan lower blood pressure
mayfield just hoping we believe this bullshit that aint his body
hold them here get another one and sit ben
the way the scoreboard marker is it looks like the bengals have 7
i like how im not stressed out too much right now i could get used to this
can this mf shut up
they interfere with our receivers almost every play luckily they are calling it today for once
yeah if we score here rest ben and free mason
johnson was gonna get nailed if he caught that
he slowed down rookie mistake
big ben and over throws so hot this game
jesus vince williams hits people like a fucking train
dolphins game over

buf az under 5 in 4th

den radiers 10 min left in 4th

steelers 1 min left in third
i heard that hit all the way from germany
defense having fun out there
that graphic of ben was a bit generous tbh
hadens hair is really something
havent checked yet have bengals fans pivoted to the usual groveling for the moral victory yet whining about the refs and how our players are all criminals bullying their gentle mom and pop club of boy scouts
looks like washington needs a td now
i dont think claypool is great at locating the deep ball
well get a deep pass one of these days
time for a james washington td
did juju just stand up a lb that was trying to light him up
juju took a helmet to helmet hit and just kept trucking
juju is a beast man ate that hit and got him some yds
id let ben rest after this drive
juju is strong and we been using him on 3rd downs akin to abs old go to role wonder if we kee juju after this year id like to
juju is tough
run the ball
this bates kid is a problem
what a punt
holy fuck if he catches that we have a game again
berrys having such a good game
punting has been stellar today
wtf that wouldve rolled to the line
the punting has been incredible he is getting serious power in these kicks
good punt
3rd week in a row ben dodged a bullet with that kind of throw
berry is a god
lets get a safety
whys he throwing these fade away floaters
lets get a safety lets go tj bud cam tuitt somebody
can these announcers please fuck off
vilma relax you dweeb
who is our guy without a mask gonna get fined
berry is suddenly a great punter and i love it
imma miss bud
this is more of a general nfl question than a steelers specificbut why when games are pretty much in control does ben not come out of the game seems like its not the norm for the nfl qbs play the whole game but its not the norm in other sports you see aging players lebron etc etc take a seat to avoid injury and weartear in blowouts

anybody know why this doesnt happen in the nfl you think this would be a perfect time for the 2nd team qb to come in for a few series
rayrayrayrayray
it seems like he is so close to a touchdown every single return
the man so nice they named him twice
my goodness mccloud is a beast
we sure got the short straw for the commentary crew
what id give to have myron cope doing the color
ryan switzer in shambles once again
juju on 3rd down
what is that hand thing juju keeps doing
damn bengals suck chant

our fans are some savages hahah
i love hines ward 20
bengals sub in shambles
im now designating 3rd downs as 3rd and juju
we love the sweeeeeeeep
nowrudolph time
ben roethlisberger is the cincinnati bengals father
we are the best football team in history
fucking claypool this dude better plant his ass on our roster and never fucking leave
man i am so glad we drafted claypool
chase is now at one touchdown per game
god damn claypool already has nine tds this year
i think i speak for everyone when i say that i would much rather see dobbs than the reindeer
such a good game all around only thing is the run we have 32 total running yards
its time for the mason handoff show
i would like to thank the gods for giving me two games this year i can be relaxed in the 4th qtrthey have spoiled me this year i appreciate them for it
its nice not to have a stroke this week
id really like more sacks

edit there we go
mason time
my heart appreciates this performance this week
williamson sighting
has avery even like played this game
stop that you already lost let me get ready for work in peace
woah not gonna lie that was cool lol
spillane baby
free sack stats baby
sack no 4
why tf would you kick a field goal there lol
haha bungals you thought
oof for burrow i wonder how many qb hits there have been because ive seen him get up off the ground waaayyy too many times
i hope hes alright
that field goal is them officially throwing in the towel
hopkins holy shit
we have lit the victory cigar
are the bengals rush defense good or is our rush game that bad

note this is only as accurate as nflcom when the bot triggers
two trains of thought
anyone else think we should give the ball to snell more
lets be honest steelers needed this you needed this i did hell everyone needed thisexcept bengals and im ok with it
my cardiac doctor thanks tthis team this week
ah yes the classic steelers move of dominating the game everywhere except the scoreboard
id cut off my pinky to never see another at home with baker mayfield commercial
why does it seem like ben has had so many batted passes this season does it have sometime to do with the way he throws now post elbow surgery
how the fuck is the masked singer still a thing especially during a pandemic
imagine a high powered offense paired with our defense

i have to stop thinking about it
i hate our playcalling so much
its not a safety because the returner didnt have possession of it before the end zone dumb rule but thats what it is
can someone explain why that wasnt a saftey
im getting close to my not wanting to see james run phase
ray ray
so glad switzer isnt returning punts anymore lol
the cumin the coriander its so tender it gets me hard then i cum its bomb steak
remember like 7 minutes ago when all you guys were shitting on the offense just have some damn patience
bengals are so bad were doing everything better statistically but are struggling only the steelers
outside run to conner for a loss of 4 comin up
go forward james forward
why do yall keep blaming conner lmao pay attention to whats going on the ol was blown back before he could get around the edge hes a north south rb blame the oc for calling a stretch play with a slow back
diontae either making a huge play or falling down
cant run against two of the worst run defenses in the league thats fucking pathetic whats the excuse
oh the pass game is working for you lets go back to run run pass to show how anemic our offense can be every week fitchner
lol idgaf what anyone says ben not in the mvp conversation is ridiculous

can we run the football our star receivers getting up limping because we refuse to even try to run the ball up 22
hes making us old guys look good

do you mean the old guys still playing or the ones who havent been playing for awhile
anyone else kind of want to see mason come in sometime soon
announcers actively rooting against our boys at this point
i hope burrow is ok i still dont like the bengals but i like burrow hes the best college qb ive ever seen
thats stupid feel these losses

vilma saying nothing but bullshit
can one of your mods please fucking ban all the morons from here that are spamming the game thread in rbengals
imagine risking our players health in a blowout
wanna see me overthrow claypool


wanna see me do it again
the victim complex in their game thread is fucking hilarious every steeler is committing a penalty on every play the nfl sucks our dicks the refs are letting us injure them and on and on and on
can we get an oc that knows what plays to call at the right time for fuck sake
anyone that defends randy is a joke its 1st and 20 why not try to run a play where they can get 1015 yards to make 2nd down more manageable
was randy fichtner responsible for that drop
its so disappointing that we cant run the ball
idk why we treat dj as our wr 1 juju is our best wr
alright lets get a damn touchdown now great field position lets go
love ray ray
i have the steelers 7 why do i feel like this game is going to end 60
i hope bens elbow stays ok
notice how ben holds the tablet his right elbox is clearly hurting because it is at a slightly shallower angle than the other

fox probably
i still think dobbs is better than mason
did bens throwing motion change he has so many balls batted
steelers football its never a easy game shame if you thought otherwise
lmao wow another conner run to the outside and another loss of 5 yards
im not sure that randys experience as a qb coach really lends itself to calling good run plays
yes gmc it is so common for people to buy cars for each other on christmas
randyfor the love of god please pass the fucking ball and dont be a conservative bitch if you are going to run a running play please run it into the middle and not outside thank you
man if fitzpatrick would have caught that he wouldve looked just like palamalu with that dive
its been 8 weeks now ben should be better with his deep throws but hes still overthrowing by a lot
vilma gets paid per word
we get it johnathan
why does this 3rd and 1 scare me so much
vilma saying we in reference to the bengals jesus christ the bias
what do you mean we kemosabe
cincinnati is really trying to get burrow killed just put in the 2nd string man its over
seems rude to put rudolph in and not even let him throw the ball
back to back 3 and outs vs the bengals why does randy fichtner have a job
edit already forgot about our lone first down

why did fichtner allow the pass to be blocked

fahr tahmlen
yo this classic smooth jazz on buffstream is legit do this during ads
little joey burrow about to be sacked 10 times i guarantee it double digit sack day or i riot
crackstreams has figure skating on they have the nbc feed up
the weather here in pittsburgh is windy as fuck but it stopped raining at least lets go stillers
bens beard is perfect at this length looks full and great while not making him look like a homeless man
my heart is pounding ugh
thats not how you wanna start the game
ben already calling plays
of course punt
st redemption run
p l a n n e d
is that the wind orrrr
snell is such a gamer on special teams
3rd and manageablechuck it deep
lot of yinz acting like wind isnt a thing
we have some of the worst offensive play calling in the nfl im so fucking sick of the hail marys on 3rd and short
was about to complain about ben trying a deep ball with this wind but then the bungels cough up a punt so whatever stop the deep balls in this wind regardless
that out of bounds moon ball on third down was all part of the plan ben used his mind powers to force the punt returner to fumble therefore by the transitive property that was a completed pass
i gotta stop checking the thread watching my slow streams ruined the surprise
conner looks amazing one game and notamazing the next never know what to expect
please score a td here
if were going to run eastwest use mcfarland use conner and snell for northsouth conner has the best hands for pass catching
with it being so windy they really need to establish the run game
i feel like he only gets yards on those this year he looks like hes running in mud when he has to go horizontally on the field
our third down offense is just something else
ill take it
bungles gonna bungle

good start
that was soft not going for it on 4th and 1 there
bosgod lmao i like it
yeah i guess its pretty windy outside here also im like 2 hours from pittsburgh

i just dont like kenny albert
so its going to be one of these games
lmao what took them so long to get down the field smh couldve had that
bungles gotta bungle
when did the bengals player touch the ball doesnt that determine whether its a safety or touchback
this game is for sure going to be a shit show
bungles are a disaster
well that was the stupidest touch back of all time lmao
wasnt a false start people just getting blown over
looking at that wind and rain im sure glad im inside with a cup of warm black tea
it seems for the first time my stream is actually ahead of the others in this thread based on the comments lmao
i love how that ref pronounces penalty especially when he says it against the bengals
wish we could over turn that
with the wind blowing need to run and run some more
ben looking for a block to throw gets me everytime
they call that hold but not the rear naked chokes on watt right
the oline needs to get space for connor
quit throwing to receivers hands ben
dj has to catch that
this offense reminds me of last week you think they would come out doing a little better
why does our offense suck
dionte has so much potential but bad drops and injuries have really held him back
also once and only once conner how about you dont put you head down and see what happens in the game when hitting the gap 0 game intelligence and awareness
why do they let the play continue
ben was like nah chill lmao
ayyy exotic run
these guys have obviously not seen the blocks ben has laid the past few years
big ben pretending like hes gonna throw a block
yes more runs like that jc
good shit jc
fix the stream come on fox
do we love connor now or do we hate on him some more
bozgawd
hopefully we dont regret these field goals
ill take an all fg game
this fucking game man
hope ben will be ok
somebody should tell ben you dont need a td on every third down lol
so sick of commercials
its gonna be hard to throw a touchdown today with these conditions
juju was coming open and probably wouldve had a td there
bosgod remains infallible
never missed against cinci i like that statistic really sticks it to them
vilma is starting to piss me off
all the youtube videos ive watched have made me expect players to step out of bounds and touch the ball in that kickoff situation whew
todays fortune cookie reads

many opportunities are open to you if you seek them out

sage words during a pandemic
how do i add a number and player name to my username
that was nice tomlin gave the bengals player a little butt slap lol
3 straight 3 and outs and the pressure still hasnt really gotten there this is a really good signz
a catch

yaaaaaas dj theres that deep ball baby
what a fucking pass
deep ball alert
lets go
that should shut fox up
still 1st qtr almost been an hour lol
so much for ben cant throw a deep ball anymore
holy shit it worked
such a great play opens up the playbook
fuck yea dj
yes
dj
bens elbow
so we should go deep on 1st not 3rd okayyyyy
and you guys were just making fun of johnson
yesss the passing game has woken up
diontaes sigh of relief was every collective steeler fans sigh of relief
dionte is a monster thank you coach drake all love
ben said fuck this wind
didnt someone earlier say johnson had stone hands looked good snagging that throw
we dey
lets go thats the ben we know love looked better than any drive last week
he caught it
quick hands
fuck hopefully mapletron is ok
finally thorough the scripted plays let ben do his thing
god no
claypool didnt even try to jump on that jump ball
looked like he just got the wind knocked out of him hopefully
3 play td drive
josh dobbs and ben
jeez its still the first quarter wow this is going to be a slowwwww game
sometimes its just a timing error
sutton was like 2 inches too short
this is what happens when you disrespect the terrible towel
lmaoooooooooo
no avery williamson today
fumbleeeeeeeeeeeee
lets fucking gooooo cam stuntin on em sutton
good fucking play cam sutton
textbook strip
riiiiiiiiip it out
noice
oh wow our boys are feeling confident today
what a strip
did we just lose 8 yards on a first down run
connor what the hell are you doing
and thats why we should keep sutton over hilton
sutton been stripping the ball a lot lately good play and way to make up for that mistake
ill say it once again they never should of messed with the terrible towel this is what happens
im listening to the radio broadcast who are the announcers one of them is literally captain obvious stating the most obvious things and its quite annoying but its better than the shitty fox announcers
why does burrow have the biceps of thor in his cartoon drawing lmaooo
i love this defense
sutton having a great year
how many bengals does it take to bring down james conner
fichtner well the passing has worked very well so lets just keep running it
just a friendly reminder fellas

defense wins championships
i havent seen him but if this game continues its current trajectory i expect he will make an appearance
that whole sequence from the defense sniffing out everything burrow was trying to do and the strip right after was just chefs kiss i love steeler football
i really wish dotson could play lg i like feiler a lot but dotson i way better
that first quarter was hella long
our wr core are just work horses
how the fuck is jersey shore still relevant who is watching this shit
damn johnson was open too
i fucking love james washington
threading the needle
jesus flying christ is ben telegraphing his throws or something
that was a vintage big ben play
berry has been pretty good since he came back
did anybody see claypool out there on any of those plays
it seems like ben is pretty regularly arguing with dj
uggghhhh
how
we rush 3 and that guy is that wide open
im amazed this line has kept burrows clean so far
sack him now
well thats not optimal
could we get some fucking pressure
bro these fox announcers are the worst
have we even come close to a sack yet
whats going on with the pass rush bad game for the front 7
burrows being smart getting rid of the ball very quickly we need to make him feel the pressure
is it me or did the 49ers look so bright that they were glowing lmaooooo

fucking ocho cinco
well fuck
we got worked there
horrible too easy of a 4th down
girl this is better than what i usually eat in the morning

interviewer what do you usually eat

girl nothing
at least it looks like claypool is back
as usual the announcers blow
nobody cares about this guy
mapletron
can ben start calling the plays again please
good play call be them lets get back on offense and control this game
for some reason i picture chase claypool jumping out of a plane with a parachute
claypool is becoming our gotoinacrunch guy
what do you tell your defence to prepare for 11


chase claypool


ill see myself out
johnson is weird
thats mr smithschuster he deserves respect
i swear people trying to hurt ben now
nice catch juju
juju
juju nice climb baby
dont rough our passer bro
do we like this pi
wow big ben never gets that call
cmon chase
shouldve caught that bullet
i thought ben might run that in for a moment
ben is taking me the fuck out i just wanna see big man rumble and use the hit stick
dpi and claypool name a better duo
that route was filthy
theres a special kind of pleasure that comes when you realize the radio is perfectly synced up with the tv audio because the refs lips move in time to what youre hearing im sure theres a word for it in german
bro i swear every team pass interferes with chase almost every time he doesnt catch the ball they usually dont call it either
if youre gonna bring in your fb give the fb the damn ball fly sweeps are too easy to notice otherwise
lets goo jujuuu
alot of balls right through hands today
right thru his hands

edit wow im really behind lol
fichtner is so laughably bad
with all these penalties i really hope this doesnt turn into the burfictpacman jones meltdown 20 game as great as it was to see them implode i dont want any of our guys getting hurt
these calls are terrible they have no faith in our run
damn great play
and here comes a touchdown
ben threw that with some heat on it
that guy tried to hit ben late
lets go
lets goooooooooo
damn ben i see you
that is what ben needs to do
voodoo juju
vintage ben moment what a job
if youre initially willing to go for 2 you should be going for 2 a second time part of the calculus of going for it is your confidence in making up for a miss by going for 2 again no
ben looking so clean right now
so that sweep call was really bad in general its done well all season but you put watt outside like hes a tight end and run to him there is no disguise or mystery doing that it was painfully telegraphed

aside from that it was a good drive
ben with 180 yards already
cam sutton has forced a fumble in three straight games dat boi showin up
assist to the bengals for generally being undisciplined some things never change
that dude was so pissed he didnt get the ball
kenny albert looks like his headset is way too tight
that last drive woke burrow up lol defense gotta get some pressure on his ass
burrow is pretty good
pressure is not getting there and burrow is simply hitting the first or second read
burrow will be a problem for us in the future maybe even now
sack streak is extended
sack streak alivee
there we go
let tj rush lets go
yall need to relax with these spicy takes of doubting well get a sack this game its the second quarter
streak alive
there it is
yes
finally dline its time to fucking eat
about time we got a sack
watt sayinghello and ill be right back
smart move by ray ray not to touch that ball
tj
first sack of hopefully many today
lets put the dagger in here
do we get another 7 on the board before the half
dj having a game
dj awareness 99
benjamin todd
be is really slinging it
ebron with a helluva catch
keep feeding em
theyre clicking
im liking this no 3rd down drive
hey ben i dare you to throw for 500 yards again
ben is starting to light it up
ebron is a fucking beast
the run designs are not very great
the amount of weapons ben has makes me sick
wide open johnson well he was 3 yards behind the line not crazy tough to be open there lol
are we allergic to running it up the middle
jesus johnson and mary
run between the tackles geez
i think our wr core is better than 3 or 4 teams wrs combined
why the actual fuck are we running
james is just lost right now
why does he bounce so far outside
conner running sideways on every play just pound the rock guy
idk who is calling the plays ben or fichtner but im glad weve seemed to finally accept the fact that we cant run the ball well lol
fichtner and really bad run calls what a team
lets gooo johnson has 116 yards in first half
wheres willie parker when u need him
line isnt really giving conner much of a chance so far
our run blocking is not great
just run it up the gut if youre gonna run it
we need a run game coordinator munchak leaving two years ago has really shown its effect on this teams play designs on the run game
somebody tell connor he isnt fast run forward my man
that outside run isnt working with the grass this wet stahp pls
wheres that steelers fan that got into a long argument with me claiming that conner is good crickets man the dude is so ineffective
i wonder how many times a game fichtner thinks itll definitely work this time
lol they told the line to make sure conner had a bad year so we can sign him next year
got away with that
i dont care if boswell needs to kick 10 fg this game

a win is a win
bozgawd
man a td would have been great there
what is heyward doing in on the offensive field goal unit
just stop running the ball its a drive killer every time
who started false

edit brillint
is the game thread not updating for anyone else
66 straight games with a sack fam

tb currently has the record with 69 nice
ayy guys were winning so dont get to annoyed
bet cams concussed
defense wtf
did heyward just get concussion on that collision
who is brooks
watt being held around his neck hah
this is some horrible defense
sakurai turned tripping on this week
fuck this soft shit
cam laying in him lol
if you cant have a beard like kiesel have some flow like that
choke hold on watt uncalled its like harrison is here once more
tj
tj waaaaaaat
lol holy shit tj
sack
why did we just let them drive 50 yards in a minute
maybe we should have some o linemen drag the refs across the field by their throats to see whether or not its a penalty
tj god damn watt again
watt says told you id be right back
lol so annoying watching our guys get held ridiculously every play with no calls
tj like shit i gotta get back
tjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
great play tj yes
fucking hell yeah tj
they should retire 25 but not in a good way makes me nervous seeing a db in it
cincy is gonna throw a sideline pass about 10 yards force a throw into the middle
pick 6
man the bengals are embarrassing
panthers you had one job
16 rushing yards
wtf happened to our run defense
come on put them away this half
vilma has one thing to talk about dude just repeats himself constantly
joe haden having a night
but our secondary is trash
haha keep throwing to haden if ya want i guess
were gonna get a block this game
ok offense your turn
that kick was almost blocked that ball probably almost split atoms with how close that was
can we stop running it holy crap
we need fitzmagic

he would bolster our rb unit
these announcers are really annoying me
stop fucking running
the line men need to be in a three point stance to fire off on the run blocks
the ole run up the gut for one yard run outside for no gain short pass behind the sticks
we should just go empty set every play
our run blocking is abysmal

winds at heinz blowing covid out of pa
the amount of people here who think the coaches are out there running the ball or telling ben exactly who to throw to is too damn high
im personally thrilled we ran on first and second down for a combined two yards
jesus christ that was a hard hit
how do you not fumble that
special teams killing it today
not watching the game but keeping up with the thread hows our oline and linebackers looking
aside from berrys first punt this season hes been quite good
wind must be behind him
berry has been good
ah the steelers special run run pass punt
justin lane would be the absolute coolest running back name of all time
why is the last play not updating on this thread
why hasnt the scoretime updated here yet
do we know were only up 15 in the early 3rd
we clearly cant put teams away lmao
thats a catch unfortunately
i dont think he had control
he had to resecure the catch might not be enough to overturn but what a grab
looks like it bobbled
the steelers seem to do very well in these slow tempo games
he bobbled the ball when he hit the ground
feet are in but he had no control incomplete
looks like the ball hits the ground
the ball isnt secure not a catch
my guess is this call stands
two feet but not control with two great effort though
hard to tell the call should stand in that case
no catch
incomplete
plz no fumble fuck these commercials
please no
love the smell of failed challenges by the bengals in the second half
these run calls are terrible
wow fuck you fox
run blocking is non existent
yeahhh lowesss woohooo
imagine if we could secure a block outside the tackle box
lets go offense
i really dont know what some of you are watching there wasnt a single replay that definitively showed his right foot in bounds
wow we cannot run the ball for shit lmao
for the love of fuck go forward
i swear fox interrupts game flow more than cbs so many breaks and side by sides
steelers rushing at 15 yards a rush
well if theyre not going to run the ball those quick passes for some yards will work lol
big boy claypool
lets go offense
good to see ben still using the pump fake
fist down baby
that pump fake even got me i really thought he threw it for a second
ebron
good catch
ebron was a amazing pick up
so did the bot die
backyard ben is the best ben
ebron falls to the ground so hard haha no grace
ebron
vilma he got the foot down but dropped the ball how bad are you
good fuckin catch ebron
what a play ben and ebron
ebron has such great communication with big ben and just being able to read how a play is going
why am i still nervous
just a casual one hander
ebron nice
lets go offense
ebron is my favorite offseason pick up
ebron you magnificent bastard
i swear if this commentator says empty package one more time
jujujujuju
the weekly abandoning of the run game is alarming we are not going to win in the playoffs if this is our approach
hell yeah juju
love the passes we run to protect ben
why do they speculate so hard about steelers potential injuries but they dont tell us about bengal db being out until the next half
a good run
a james conner first down
we had a good run
finally a great run by conner
easier to run when theres a hole huh
juju is the answer to third down conversions it took ab a few years to get that role
juju is such a security blanket on 3rd down
ben taking over as oc and im so much happier
conner is like 3 1 4 2 1 5 20
juju so clutch
i know this is killing randy since he loves to run the bill cowher offense but the run game isnt working its ok to abandon it to keep the ball away from cincy
lets go offense
thread the fuckin needle
i love claypool
ben throwing darts today
just run the guy straight up the middle
holy fuck
i reeeeeally like our wr room
dam what a catch claypool
big canada boi
oh wow see fichtner thats the kind of running lanes you can get when you pass first
whew
mapletronnnnn
strongggggg mapletronnn
now james washington just needs one
gimme more mapletron
oh my god ben threw a fucking laser bolt right there
its still just the third qtr

cmon clock
this is how i thought last week was going to go
whered all the complainers go
claypooooooooollll
bens pump fake is still one of the best in the game
it aint over until its over
losing never heard of her
kenny albert looks like a guy who were supposed to praise for his determination in recovering from a horrific accident
so i thought we were worried about burrow guys lmfao i told you guys those 2 good throws earlier didnt mean anything
another three and out for the bungles whomp whomp
lets go offense
i do believe this is the first time in 8 games where i havent been freaking out at this point
nvm i dislike vilma now

bengals have zero pass rush holy shit
why do they let those plays continue
please just i do love claypool just laughing in that guys face
saints fans getting a monkey paw finger to curl with winston in the game now
man if ben can connect on these deep balls we would be such a hassle for defenses
i dont think ive seen a sadder live game thread than the bengals sub crying for obvious dpi calls and just all around sad people honestly feel bad for them
damn its still the 3rd quarter
once again our games take so long
vince just killed a guy
this fox graphic makes it look like the bengals have 7
did anyone else hear

no its not fair

after that last broken up pass
defense is eating today
time for the mercy rule sheesh
you guys think we should take ben out for the 4th or not up enough
goddamn we have some talented receivers but their hands are sus as fuck
claypool turned the wrong way
dammit that was close
lets go offense
the lb led with his head all the way
i swear i havent seen tomlin once
can someone smarter than me explain why i havent been hearing steven nelsons name this year
probably would have been 6
dont throw that ben
bruh that ball was gonna roll to the one
just get the 1 yards come on
lets go defense
tj trying to finally catch up to dereks safety stat
get a safety
such a long game wow
jonathan vilma is fucking annoying i dont even hate him because he is hating the steelers any clear bias against another team as an announcer is annoying as can be
joe burrowswelcome to the nfl today was your baptism
what kind of throw was that burrow lmfao
what a fucking return
ray ray is the chosen one
rayray
damnit i thought we were gonna see it there
ray ray
i love rayray
hes gonna get in there one day this year
ray rays field vision is so fucking good
was gonna say mccloud was pissed bc he lost a gem of a punt when the flag was thrown but lol bengals gave him another gem
rayray is the leveon bell of returners
why is ben still in the game
lets go ray ray
ray ray is gonna house one soon enough hes been incredible all year returning
so good they named him twice
almost there if he doesnt get a special teams td at some point this season itll be a travesty hes been awesome
mccloud is perhaps the best last name to exist
ray ray should be an all pro what an absolute god send this man is
ray ray should make the all pro pr team what a great pickup that was
love conner but where are the other rbs
ray ray a simple juke then wham afterburners
juju punishes everyone
have my kids juju
honestly i cant blame conner when hes constantly hit in the backfield every time
juju is a touch son of a bitch
11 mins remaining my lord
juju is so tough man just has that spirit
not good for the other guys when the announcer says the game is practice for the steeler offense
juju
when youre so bad multiple commentators have referred to the game as practice lol
is this the best receiving corp in the game
mapletron again
claypool again
maple mother fucking tron
mapletron

mapletron
time to call in the reindeers
someone in this thread commented that ben was going to reach 400 yards and 4 tds lol and were not even playing from behind
i know its the bengals but this pass game can beat almost any team its just the run game that will hold them back
feels weird to me that it only took cinci 5 years to go from playoff contenders to bottom feeders in our division
take notes joe big ben handing out free lessons
juju and ebron lmaooo
just need an int now
jesus this game is taking forevs
avery williamson finally getting some snaps
011 on 3rd downs jeez
space launch in 5 minutes
thats not even a bulky jacket thats just ben in a tshirt
lets surpass our shit pushing in of the browns here and hold them to 7 here and get at least one more score
big shout out to the boys that took pit at 7 today
bring out mason
012 with a sack chefs kiss
defense is eating lunch right now and making the bengals pay for it

edit naturally i make this comment and the d makes me eat my words lol
fuck garbage time points
uh oh bungles getting uppity

guess mrs watt and dupree need to turn it back on
is that what you want bengals more sacks on burrow
man imagine if they tried to run it on us this game lol it might be a whole other game
theyre going to try to make a game of it

yeah no
spillane yes
whoa didnt realize spillane was a football bloodline
theres the sacks i was looking for
they need to take burrow out were teeing off
spillane
their offense wanted to stay on the field knowing full well what it is we do to outsiders round these parts
tj watt seems pissed for some reason he keeps hitting every bengals player near him after plays hadnt noticed that about him in previous games
now we get to watch rudolph
hopkins is a fucking monster
looks like rudolph got to play after all
gonna be kickoff for night game soon
a lot of backups b playing
if we dont blow these clowns out
lotta roethlisberger passes getting batted at the line this year
why does fox always come up with shows that never make it past the first season
i hope that series made yall realize it isnt conners fault the run game is bad

its the oline we had a jumbo tight end and a fullback and they couldnt block they suck at blocking
some of our fans like to only comment when the other team scores just so they can complain

but when we do something good they silent
im fucking done with randy like honestly fuck this guy the outside run isnt fucking workingben is having a career game against these bums
third and medium go deep
what was that into the arms of juju who was already getting tackled
kudos to tomlin for not giving up on boz after his awful season hes really come through
edmunds cant catch shit bruh lmfaooo
might have been a bit of pi there
oh boy another uninspired run play

and a penalty too
i really dislike the reliance on little dink and dunk short plays
conner is painful to watch at times
lmao chase with the savvy veteran move tossing the ball back a few extra yards i appreciate him taking the swing lol
this play calling is ridiculous but i swear sometimes it looks like james conner just has no idea what hes doing out there i love him but hell bounce it out when he should just run hard forward and vice versa at the worst times
the secondary came to play today
good return ray ray
this game may drag on for another 4 hours
ray ray is so shifty
breaking news

joe haden got a pbu and it wasnt called dpi

i repeat

joe haden got a pbu and it wasnt called dpi
lol i love ben and has a history of being the toughest qb in the league but after decades of abuse dude cant even give himself up without risking season ending injury
i swear to god this offense is fucking impotent when it comes to closing out a drive
ok webmd boys how fucked is claypool
wow

is this the bungles home announce team
only rushing 3 burrow finding open receivers over and over again
what the hell is connor doing
i dont know what conner saw there
whats the big deal about burrow am i missing something
conner is cheeks
idk why everyones so mad at conner hes not asking for these plays
16 rushing yards out of 256 total yards so far man our running attack is anemic to say the least im honestly impressed that were able to pass so well with defenses basically putting everyone in coverage since our running game isnt a threat whatsoever
why is watt never getting calls for holding hes always getting held it seems
burrow fell into a bench
this game feels closer than the score suggests
ugly but thats how we do great first half
have to find out a way to get the run game going literally anything positive
every time i flush a toilet i think of where it goes downstream to the bengals
joe savy haden
pity we cant call a decent run play for connor but anyone see that pancake block he just did
lmao what the fuck is up with this announcer tj watt just saved a 15 yard gain you could say something like that about every fucking playif he doesnt make that tackle its a 15 yard gain if he throws that ball accurately that wouldve been a completed pass
big ben and over throws so hot this season
fans need this shit its been a rough few weeks
mapletron gotta be leading oroy candidate
now the game is looking like it is supposed to and keep the foot on the gas through the end of the game not the usual one foot on the gas and the other on the brake when ahead probably the only lesson to take from belicheat
aj green has had his career wasted
sit ben or riot
ok i guess i can stop complementing the special teams group today
welcome to your future joe
if gordon ramsay was our oc he wouldve kicked conner out of the kitchen already
since 2h of that titans game the offense has looked like a bottom 10 offense
this stuff is exactly why no one takes the steelers seriously even though theyre undefeated
how is it so windy inside a stadium
the masked singer is such garbage television cant die soon enough
wanna kill the drive hand the ball to connor
almost 200 yards for burrow from playing horseshit zone and prevent pressure him bury him into the turf
is bradshaw drunk or something he can barely speak
and james conner just tanked that drive in one play
punt it again


its free downs
terrible playcalling
fox is using the cartoons as a test for when they air their newest show nfl anime
we really find every way to waste an amazing oline
offensive playcalling literally the only thing holding them back this year
our offense needs to take advantage of the short field here
mccloud good
that was a great throw but just a better defensive play by haden
mccloud is the shit
i swear rayray is just getting closer and closer to breaking one off
guys this game isnt going to be offensive football that were accustomed to until 3rd4th quarter get comfy and expect some 3 and outs the rest of the first half
with these winds its likely that our defense will score a td before the offense
lmao theyre lucky ben didnt try to nail anybody he wouldve killed someone
ben shakes hand


defcon 5
bro can vilma shit the fuck up
thats bens first long pass in two years
they stopped forcing the run
either catch it or it breaks your ribs asshole

ben to dj probably
whats the word on derek do they just not fancy him on offense or what 3rd and 2 should be a power run not 5 wide
we have 1 of those per game on defense


all normal here its ok
didnt they ban dunking on the crossbar
that throw was peak ben if he can channel that energy combined with the best regular season the steelers have ever had i just dont think we can be beaten
soooo they are saying the afc north is full of good teams except for the bengals reality must sting

lmao he practically handed him the ball and he still dropped it hahahaha
hilarious to see the bengals sub crying
conner is simply incapable of getting yards
god i hate fichtner run run pass this offense is clearly not built for running the football they need to be using the passing game to open up the running lanes but tomlin and fichtner refuse to understand that
ok we might win this game
im happy we have a great lead but all i can think of is 19mins of game clock remaining lol
297 is nothing guys we could blow this lead do not think its over
amazing catch absolutely immaculate throw
a stress free sunday

outside of the stress of finishing grad work but still
if the bengals have to punt probably should take ben out

they wont though
can we put dobbs in to see how he does pls
ray ray has to be top 5 returner in the league right
vilma saying burrow is gonna do a better time next time like wtf bro
touchdown claypool get the fuck off the field you scums of the afc north
get the boswell photoshop ready
what is that celebration that juju keeps doing after his good receptions
there was nuke dropped in buffalo just now

pray for the mafia
burrows was grabbing his kneeshit
im fine with giving snell the ball for the rest of this game but hes not the guy moving forward hes had his opportunities this season and hes fumbled them away none of the steelers backs are going to be great because the offensive line is not good at run blocking the steelers need to lean on the passing game if they want to win a championship this season throw to set up the run not the other way around
i told you guys that conner ruins the momentum once he touches the ball
3 and out


blow it up


fire sullivan
great gameplan on 3rd down again
hmm we only scored a field goalfire tomlin
why did we go for 2 in the 1st quarter just kick the fucking xp
this game is going really slow compared to all the others there are games at halftime or about to me and were still at 1030 in the second
in spite of us winning currently it is infuriating seeing this team with no run game
bench ben

send out rudy
fuck it put dobbs in
in dallas how can i watch game
predictions
thoughts
the bungles are pulling cbs off the practice squad so ben should be bombing all day no excuse not to
browns are about to win
ok hope so only 4 min to go
were winning and thats it boys
here we go
here we goo
would love to see us come out 5 wide ben hurry up
game time lets get this w
opening drive touch down incoming
windy game i guess we got this do nothing but score touchdowns are on two point conversions
lets go boys
theyre sending pressure early
lets fucking go
not the greatest drive to start the game
dont worry rocky you go when youre ready
lets go
i like it
1 already lfg
lets be honest ben has lost some accuracy still love that man tho
ben missing practice this week could hurt us
benny snell football
okay now score a td
bungles showing up early
typical bungles
lets just say ben made the pass to claypool fumbled it and snell recovered it
special teams out here today
we should punt more often
ola
benny snell football boys
its always funny to me how you can tell who is streaming the game vs watching on tv based on the delayed reactions haha
bengals already turning things over steelers have to capitalize off this and score
first game ive only listened to for awhile since im not home today

worried about tunch his speech has noticably changed
big special teams play thats a good sign
looks windy af out there
someone is definitely going to blow a tire on the garbage blowing around heinz field right now
boswell that ends well
clutch
ill take it
i dont like seeing berrys knees
danny smith chewing up the bengals today
3 and out twice but three pointill take it
that were honestly 2 pretty bad drives at least we got 3 points out of this
lmaooooo
wait what
wait why it hit him
sound like a damn hurricane there
need tds dont want the bengals hanging around
lmao what the fuck
buttered the ball
not gonna be a lot of passing today i believe
what blows harder the wind in pittsburgh or the bungles
nice play 23
watt being hugged
is mike hilton back
bungles lol
was that fucking cat stevens in a dodge ram commercial fuck
think theres going to be a lot of turnovers and botched plays with the wind
come on rayray i feel a runback coming
connor stop bouncing it outside
theres not even 5 minutes off the clock yet damn
cant even gain a yard on a run even with the hold
weird looks like ebron was getting held there nah steelers wouldnt be getting fucked on calls in a game that never happens
that kickoff sequence still seems odd to me the only reasonable explanations for it not being a safety to me is that they either ruled he didnt touch the ball or that when he first touched it he was already in the endzone id tend to believe it was the latter since it looked obvious to me that it was touched still wouldve liked to gamble with a challenge there
i hope we have a backup plan because ebron is the worst run blocker out there
not a fan of these outside runs
catch it dj
been ugly for both squads so far
geez
we will get it going need to key in on the plays on offense
i want to see ray ray get a st touchdown so bad
surprised to see antwon brooks getting so much playing time
ben plz dont lol
i want the other half that oreo ad where santa has to kill the guy and the elf to keep his secret secure
taking a page from the ravens there
i was likewhaaaa benjamin you no block
claypool
thats more like it gj conner
i love seeing ben as a lead blocker but it also scares the hell out of me
thats how you use presnap motion to open up the run game
here we go jc
im always scared of conner
go connor
now were moving
wind knocked out of him
lets get a td here please

of fucking course he did
dont do this to me
come on get the first down didnt need the endzone shot
should we blame this on wind
its a definite difference between randy and canadaroethlisberger
holy fuck if i have to see elbow watch one more time
bosgod to the rescue
damn washington was wide open
trying to make something out of nothing

hey i resemble that remark
washington was wide open not a bad call against a man blitz and the mesh worked had a touchdown
ben is still human bonking your elbow hurts no matter who you are chill out announcers
they do this elbow thing every single game
praise be
what spiritual bondage does this team have with going deep on 3rd and medium
we should make an effort to get juju the ball
hints of boswells 2016 game against kc
by gawd its bozgawd
i swear the gals have no cbs but the crap weather is gonna not going to let the steelers take advantage
why are they talking good about rudolph lol
it would be cool if we didnt call asinine plays on 3rd and short
why did the commentators say bozgod has never missed a kick against the bengals
he picked the absolute worst place on his entire body to land on there
hes probably lucky he just fell down
tough game but i think were looking much better than cinci
can our offense get us a lead
stupid penalties
hopefully he completes this first downi dont want to be the guy complaining about announcers not being impartial but like wtf
dj
there we go
wait is it 3rd quarter already
keep er going boys
its smellin like td already
so 38 year old ben is a warrior going for the extra yard but landing on his throwing elbow big fella thats why they invented the slide so you dont have to do that shit to yourself
beautiful deep ball by ben with the wind
yeah his elbow is going to be just fine
t u d d y
dj what a play there u go baby i fucking see you 18
sheesh that was perfection by ben
if anybody wants to have a laugh just visit the bengals subreddit
theres that farm boy strength there
lets gooo
now thats a drive
ez
this receiving corp
best drive of the year
pi
they heard yall complaining about a long quarter
fucking finally
johnson making it look easy

thats what i wanted to see from the offense
damn that was fast
so hopefully rnfl calms down after we played a bad game against the cowboys
spilling over the lane
spillaine wanted borrows
spillane went like three yards over on that lol
a glitch in the robo code
oh my god the bengals running offense is so bad
what do you guys think should we be worried about joe burrow or nah
another take away baby
burrow did not like what he saw from the defense
foxs graphic packages are so fucking lame
ripped that ball outta there
thanks higgy
sutton a beast
friendship ended with mike hilton

friendship started with cam sutton
hell yes
hahahaha gimme that
strip that shit boi
jesus fuck what are you lot drinkin on
lets fuck go d
man sutton is playing out of his mind the last few games
sutton has stepped up big time with hilton out
nice strip
hes going hes going hes zuhhhhhhhhh
avery williamson teaching his new team some tricks
i dont get it we get the ball back and then the offensive line is nowhere to be found
bungles gonna bungle
how is it only the first quarter still
cartoon ben is jacked
uh guys you gonna block like one person
do we have a fb
classic ben play right there
stop fucking running powerruns yeah o line is not helping but for fuck sake lets sell the power run
playing against our defense is a great test of your grip strength
did it get a lot darker or is my stream messed up
play calling is ass
we so desperately want to throw these behind the los passes its scary any chance we can do more of those 2 yard passes instead
with how their offense is going shouldnt have let that ball go out the back of the end zone maybe he saw the way it was spinning or something
can someone tell me why so many passes are bering batted down
damn im working so im not able to watch the game but i see the score on espn and this shit wildin
we met over a century ago

fuck i know i look awful for my age but im not that old
burrow had a pick6 this year yet
inconsistent
damn they left him wide open
hold em for three boys
damn he got sandwiched
we use our base defense too much when other teams have 3 or 4 guys out wide
hold em off boys
lame
damn

what is the sack streak at
lets go offense
the bengals special teams are actually pretty good
juju bro
the ball is going to be thrown hard to beat the wind our receivers need to know that and catch the god damn ball
empty set ben moving the ball same stuff different week
didnt drop that
drops are killing us
yay claypool
what a catch
made up for that drop jujuuuuu
56 celebrating as if he actually did something
that was innocent
why does diontae keep trying to juke
there we go

listen to vilma jesus christ
damn that couldve been bad
personal foul roughing the ben
first down by interference

ok by me
chsse is mad cuz that dude cost him a td
typical cowardly bungle shit from hubbard
carson palmer would die from that
thinking about just muting the tv at this point
that was shades of kimo von oelhoffsen
you cannot defend him
fuck sam hubbard punk ass
dpi vs claypool
claypool draws flags like a maniac
claypool sold that like a grizzled veteran
i mean id hug chase claypool too though the bengals should wait until after the game or even the play itself
wth was that
automatic first down
that was a fucking missle
right through his hands
thats what ben fucjing does
juju how i love u
juju td
bungles gonna bungle
classic ben
bengals game planned for that claypool sweep
yes
well that was ugly as fuck
big benjamin
dude did you steal my rooster
damn that would have been sick if he could have caught that
can we stop with these runs
jujuuuuuuu
juju
ju ju
juju
offense looking much better now
ok lets get a stop defense
try and dmca claim that one twitch
fuck i lost signal smh saw on twitter that juju got a td tho
beautiful pass beautiful catch lets go juju

lets good great play by ben that was huge
glad to see boz and the kicking team get it back together even in tough weather
big ben lets go
lets keep that sack streak alive
aww yiss nice to be up 7 juju
anyone else see that dude in the stands give away the td ball
so is higgins just going to win the matchup all day like whatshisname did for the eagles
yikes were in trouble if burrow has these open receivers all day
oh that was jujus momma
good holding call i like that
finally a sack
theres watt
these announcers polishing off the tip of burrow and the bungles
the streak continues
has burrow held the ball for longer than 3 seconds yet this game

x200b

nevermind just over 4 seconds there and sacked
hells yeah
eat that dirt
with how many flags the bengals have been drawing they might want to be careful with what they are wishing for in hoping to see a flag come out
theres that sack
sack
i mean we can play defense but we cant really run for shit more times than not so thats not exactly true
there it is
lol they show myles instead of baker
what is the streak at now
finally thank you tj
ok time to get some points before half
hehehe tj
it would be great if we could score a touchdown here
anyone know what the strap hanging off of bud is
now were cooking
lets score now boysssssss
way to hold on to it ebron
so many drops today
ravens and browns are so mad we stay undefeated
fuck that wind we throwing that thang today
i missed seeing him take intermediate throws
that tip scared me im scared of the tip
dj didnt even put two hands up there
theyll keep sleeping on us until were in the super bowl i guess
ebrontosaurus
when ben and his receivers are in sync running games are optional
lets go ebron
great run and pass
shotgun shotgun anybody
jesus christ wtf was that play
great play by dj but i dont know what that db was thinking with that lack of effort to force him out of bounds
why call the run if no one can block today
bruh fuck a run game just let ben sling it for 60 minutes
johnson is unfuckingreal today
great to see the offense is clicking early
dj is getting busyyyyyyyyyy
dj is coated in oil
im liking the offense but these outside runs are not working pls stop
whats going on with all these outside runs
every fucking time jeez
are we technically an air raid team this year
if we stopped running connor to the outside wed have a much better run game
we cannot run the ball
ben looks pissed about that call
literally our dudes are pass blockinn there run up the middle let conner get 1 or 2 instead of 5
even if thats the play call how dense is conner to run backwards 10 yards on three handoffs now just get back to the line of scrimmage if the blockers are pushed that far back obviously youre not getting anywhere going that way
with how slow this game is ill be surprised if the game is over before snf starts
of course i have conner starting against dj in fantasy this week
for fucks sake just run at them
conner enjoys going backward
lol conner runs outside for yards i have seen this one before
this might be a stupid question but could conner have thrown the ball forward out of bounds there like when a quarterback scrambles out of pocket they can throw it away out of bounds
should the pregnant lady being coming over and hanging out with friends during a global pandemic
im glad juju has been putting up numbers the last few weeks
i see everyone bashing conner and hes part of it sure but the play calling is just bad the shotgun run game and too many pulling linemen are making it nearly impossible to get a clean hole
all hail bosgod
and then we have the give up short pass on 3rd and 15 lol oof
thank you bozedgod
some games are already almost to the 4th quarter and here were are still 12 drives from half lol
not a pittsburgh fan but a conner owner in fantasy he did really well now hes giving me duds the last two weeks whats going on
ben has more passing yards right now than in 5 other games this season
edmonds didnt do anything there
prevent defense smh
not a db on this roster that can cover higgins
watt
it is amazing how much a difference mike hilton makes in this secondary
terrell edmonds doesnt miss tackles
what the fuck defense
i mean i get that they are trying to call less holds but how do you miss something so blatant
what a beast
look at mondeux and then look at tj you cannot tell they are both professional athletes
bro they held watt right there
tj wattttttt
tj
lol bungles
bend dont break
this half is never going to end
jesus haden got fucking trucked lol
our defense keeps hitting each other
its lucky that was overthrown
anyone notice buds tail
great stop
just woke up from my nap falling asleep in the first quarter whatd i miss
the defense has burrows number
happy feet cant commit
the defense is good at stopping the run
i feel like there really is no pockets for running
man conner
i really wish we would stop with these runs
not gonna lie im excited watching miami find some rythem hope that team does well they deserve it
how are we supposed to beat good teams if we cant run and cant convert
i see we started the conservative approach already
juju looks great today while conner not so muchwonder if either of them are kept around after this season
our running game brings nothing to the table
where would you guys rank haden in terms of best fa signings all time by pittsburgh 2 behind farrior or 1 perhaps
run run pass

why the fuck do they go out of their way to stop doing what works
booooom
berry goood
what a punt
maybe we are tanking our offense to try and get tj more sacks
jordan berry is back
holy fuck berry boomed that shit
do we have another back today like to see em
jesus what a tackle on the punt returner timed to perfection
who is this punter lol
what a fucking play
great punt and coverage
seems like he didnt have full control of the ball and had to adjust but well see
looks like a catch to me
thats a catch
no catch
didnt maintain control anyone know if thats a thing anymore
did he bobble the ball
ball moved incomplete
catch
one more td and we are good to go
probably a catch
can go either way
the ball was still moving the entire time
iffy not enough to overturn on with the punt
ball is loose
its gonna be a catch from me dawg
anyone been keeping an eye on antoine brooks hows he played so far
the call is incomplete theres not enough evidence to overturn it
incomplete
the ball came out
thats a coin flip call i could see it going either way although if you are unsure the standard is to defer to the ruling on the field
hold on to the ball ray ray got lucky there
oh shit
bengals down a timeout
thats a bad call that benefits us my favorite
almost a fumble still not missing switzer
our run game just isnt there at all
they called him down already dumbass
that definitely looked like a fumble to me was it actually the steelers that recovered
its like every fifth play a jet sweep at this point
waoew
ah lets go to another jet sweep when the last 2 didnt work
imagine running the exact same sweep expecting different results
bengals dont even have a challenge anyways
i dont recall us ever having a running game this bad
stop running
if its not working at first just keep doing it until it works
damn it the run game is just not on today
claypoooooool
lets go offense
please stop running sweeps 10 times a game just please stop
overusing the wr run claypool is a wr
our running game got snapped out of existence like 4 weeks agolike it dont exist anymore
i like how he sat on the bench lol
the steelers have tried everything possible to get the run game going ummmm no they havent every run has been to the left side where villanueva has been getting owned all game

run to the right
cant run the 2 yards
fuck the run game its not working we either keep passing the ball or give cincy more possessions and time to try and get back into it
lets go offense
its almost scary how bad our rush d was without alualu now how bad our rushing offense is with vance out
vilma really needs to look at our pass success rate and run success rate before saying we must run the football i agree it has to be better but its not necessary if something else is working better
this announce doesnt know anything about our team lol
haha ben faked the camera man with that pump
i love watching ben move backwards
not to continue shutting on the run game but conners best play of the game is a 6 yard reception god damn
4 plays of 4 wr 1 te empty 44 for 98 yds td
soo yall explained to me how ass our oline is so who do yall see staying on this line next year cuz all i see is pouncey aging hard as well and dd
chase claypool is having a ton of fun playing football and you love to see it
ben threw him open
i couldve sworn cc got both feet down
ebron is a freak
4th read there 5th read that play was definitely never meant to go to ebron
ebron first down baby
ebron only makes spectacular catches it feels like lmao
thank you ebron
ben pumping the ball always gets me a lil wet
if only they could rush for 2 but they are averaging 15
that was a fantastic fucking catch
the o line has put allall of their energy into pass blockinglike they monstard themselves
claypool was so open there
wow total yards are that close
ebron did a great job of getting his legs up and away from that tackle too many injuries getting pinned by defenders
lets go offense
go to juju
jujujujujujuju
large wounded quail
finally
there u go conner
take that connor haters
did i just see a running play go for positive yardage and a first down
juju keeping the chains moving
oh shit a positive run
laser
yeeeeeee
mapletron strikes again
thats threading the needle there
mapletron td
wtf is this camera work
this is the game we needed
love it
once again that ben pump fake is still elite
fucking laser beam
my ff team thanks you chase
im sensing a takeaway coming up to seal the deal
easy win baby im not even gonna watch the fourth quarter
ben finding his rhythm is so fun to see love it
mapletron
ben baby why you try to kill me this way
im starting to think this one might not come down to the last drive
name a better duo the steelers and beating the bungles

honestly thought ben was going to hit conner over the middle on that td play
this game is awesome this gaaaammme is awwweeesooommmeeeeeyeah
i think were starting to rattle burrow
what happened to aj green injuries
roll safeties roll
lets go offense
how many yards is ben at
automatic first down
bet bengals fans say that wasnt pi
the pass blocking is still pretty good but i think the difference between the mike munchak unit and the shaun sarrett unit is the run blocking
lets go offense
dionate almost got killed there
b i n c e
lets go defense
bince
bince go boom
whats the bus up to these days maybe he can come in just pound the rock in these games at least pick up 3 yards a carry
holy fuck
dont risk ben anymore trash time is coming need to find a way to run though
gotdamn vince
bince
vince laying the wood
bince that guy has a family
damn bince chill lol
what a hit jesus
williams about knocked the soul out of that guy
vince violence
vince williams followed by where da hood at lmao love it
vince
hit stick
these bengals are really bad eh
gotta love big bens six pack in that drawing lol
010 on 3rd
burrow looks like hes not wanting to put that much weight on his right ankle when getting helped up he kept it extended like he was avoiding using it getting up he might be hurt
watch for a fake here
ben with his brian shaw forearms in thee graphic
alejandro is so sunburnt today lol
this has to be last series for starters right
lets go offense
3rd and 1 think well try to run for a first down
lets go offense
berry having a career day
1st and goal lol
at least our special teams are doing a lot better this week
i dont think pittsburgh is the orange team ref
berry has been on point today special teams really bringing it today
this game is suuuper slow im happy about it personally but its crazy its this late with a whole quarter left
bud needs some sack love today
i know this isnt about the steelers guys but did the announcers say that drew brees got hurt bad
just a tad short
safety would be quirky
great stop there
9 and fucking oh baby
its weird to hear vilma keep calling the steelers a good running team
you know i want to see

i want juju on his twitch to go to burficts house and tackle him when he opens the door
burrow is definitely hurt his throwing mechanics look fucked and he doesnt have the power or accuracy he did earlier cause he cant put his full weight on his right ankle
not the first game zac taylor has conceded this year
man this game has been unbelievably slow with these penalties
haha nice one
almost took it the house he will break one some day
lmfaoooo fuck ray ray i fucking love you
mccloud
ray ray has been such a difference maker this year
i love ray ray hell get one before the season is over
god hes fast
ben still here
damn ray ray has been so close to busting one multiple times this season i hope he gets that td at some point
they couldnt let mccloud finally return one for a touchdown

so fucking close
mccloud is a problem for special teams
damn punter mcloud was so close to breaking that
steelers now entering the heinz red zone

thank you ray ray
big play ray ray
just give ben some rest no im not just saying that because i picked the under
ray ray is so close to housing one this season its coming
ray ray strikes again
ben doesnt want to come out it seems
lets go offense
shades of hines ward there
lmao we really cant run the ball at all
first down juju
juju you fucking madlad
finally a graphic without those horrible drawings
lol the bungals
lets bench some guys i guess
chase x2
9 touchdowns in 9 games what a tank
cryingbengalsladyjpeg
6 of the 9
we sweep more often than a maid
the sweep worked once this game
mapletron x2
its easy lets go boys
this soon to be win is so much better with all the trash bengals fans were talking a few hours ago
claypool is a fucking magnet to the endzone
lets gooo claypoooool
wow an easy win woo hoo lets enjoy the rest of the game
i swear these pants fit when i put them on this morning
anyone else ready to see rudolph for the rest of the game and you think you hate randys run calls so far this game just wait till that is the majority for the 4th quarter now
okay now we can start thinking about subs
game over lets call it a day and move on
we should just put an oliner at rb and pass every down
entered the game as 7 point favorites i get the questions with who would be available due to covid and the shaky performance the past few games but how disrespectful lol
yeah bengals go all out the last 10 minutes of the game only high iq plays from cincinnati
williamson sighting
please rest all starters
ok now lets pray for no injuries
mason warming up
another sack
haden playing a young mans game today love to see it
lol
more sacks more sacks
what are we at 3
that should be a full sack for bud i think
also yikes lol
you should expect anything
ben needs to go out and run through them for that
lmao
all that effort just to kick a fg yikes
spillane heard nance and villa lolol
has avery williamson played at all i dont recall seeing him at all the last two games
its gonna be mason time here
damnnnn that dhop catch was crazy lol
human victory cigar
90
here we go steelers here we go
ben is washed up
x200b

woot woot

x200b

steelers 90
pounceys been blowing snaps again lately and its upsetting
conner looking for contact he couldve got 23 more yards if he went more upfield instead of running toward the defender lmao
thanks conner
james conner honestly isnt very good i hope we get rid of him this offseason
fichtner is a genius run run pass punt beautiful
why go for 2 omfg
we dey

edit first comment noice
ben cannot complete a deepball this season
the only thing i hate more than chucking the ball deep on third and manageable are teams that line in the shotgun on 3rd and short
terrible playcalling
disappointing outcome but man what a hold great job by berry

lmao
well now we have to fucking chuck it on this series
ebron kinda being not the guy so far
i know its not conners fault but this is just agonizing to the eyes lmao
getting tires of diante johnson dropping balls
apparently roethlisberger shouldnt have been removed from the throwvid19 list

acura compared to the wild west our cars are fast
its crazy how bad our run blocking has become
bit ballsy to decline it but well see
alright ben unleash the beast
some more running woes offensive line getting bullied
just when i was gonna complain about conner
wind must have affected the shot gun snap
why do they make bens elbow a thing every week hes old
this is guy is talking like ben is already out of the game
seems like edmunds dropped enough picks to finally put on a pair of gloves
i was talking shit about dj on the last possession as you can see theres good reason im not a nfl gm or coach
wtf spillane literally no one was moving
this run offense is a joke so far against one of the worst running defense in the league looks like they are playing together for the first time ever poor
is claypool good
connor gives me heartburn
hold em to 3 fuckboys
this is what happens when your offense cant score touchdowns
jesus christ defense plz no more blown coverage
i thought dunking the football on the crossbar was a penalty now
what the fuck happened to our defense over the last four weeks

no pass rush is just gonna further expose this secondary
please catch the ball
alright thats enough drops for the day guys catch the ball and take it to the fucking house lol
ffs catch the ball
yo if we dont score here more heart attack football
oh shit we converted a 3rd down
vilma should be fired just said ben never has balls batted down and hes had like three this game already
hows the game going power is out here for hours
is the chat happy now
fire keith butler
conner seems to really overcomplicate things for himself
my heart cant keep stopping like this it cant be good for my health
3rd and long can i get uhhhhhhhh wr screen
what a way to kill a drive

how does tomlin not sit down with fichtner and get this play calling sorted out
so glad we traded for avery williamson to not play him
lol that karate kid guy was totally checked out for that commercial
dam what a catch
wtf are yall watching did yall not see the ball move a shit ton when he hit the ground also looked like the ball touched the ground also
roughing the fucking passer man call it refs
hey i think im hearing abe lincoln speak because were up by four score bitches
why do i still feel nervous
sip a beer every time these announcers say covid
claypool has covered how many deep balls so far this year

1
old man needs a nap he deserves it letbensleep
jesus christ fell for a fake
watt hasnt been on the field anyone know anything
definitely did not see that coming thats a bummer
make a game of it is vilma on crack
at least the bengals are putting on a comedic performance
we broke burrow
snell showed more heart in that last run than conner has all day tbh
9 and oooooooooooo
run game is not working with conner let snell run one or mcfarland at least mix it up because its predictable
doesnt feel like we had a dominant first half
this game feels like an autism simulator where the world moves in slow motion
any hate on connor shows you have a bad football mind steelers have been weak on zone blocking for years and connor has never been a strong outside runner this is play designing at our own weakpoints and its embarrassing
why are we so bad in the first quarter
our offense is bad
tomlin playing 4d chess by declining the penalty and letting burrows accuracy stat take a hit s
2020 pittsburgh steelers and settling for a field goal name a more iconic duo
his whole career ive seen diontae johnson as wr2wr3 similar to markus wheaton or darrius heyward bey its time to start realizing that diontae johnson is more than that hes a better martavis bryant
if we struggle this game ima be really concerned about this team
this defense is a bit overrated they do shit like that instead of keeping their feet on the gas
only the steelers would allow the bengals a season long 90 yd drive
people are freaking out because theyre checks notes up 5 on the bengals with 10 minutes left in the second quarter
conner stinky poo poo
maybe conner is just average
tf is up with james connor
great half and our offense even had 5 bad drives
id put in rudolph next series
theres the berry we know and love
90 is nice but imagine if we had a scrappy gym rat lunch pail working class steeler football fullback head coach
watching the replay they couldve called a pi on haden
steelers football
did we really just give up a fake punt thats it fire everybody dont know how much longer i have to say it do we even care about winning do we even care about our season im really starting to consider rooting for a new team that doesnt allow things like that to happen ridiculous i hope that i can find a new team to root for that is actually good
lets go baby
he was wide open another miss of the deep ball by ben smh
way to convert a fourth down
3rd and 5 we need at least 30
some of yall already need to chill
just ordered some wingstopits gonna be a good day
that was hilarious
who wants to bet we keep taking deep shots despite bens accuracy issues this year and the wind
offense is an absolute mess so far why am i not surprised
drop by johnson
we should get jamaal williams next year
johnson needs to stop trying to do too much and just run straight
diontae has the most stone hands on this team lol
djs sixth drop of the year
ok another 3 and out nice now offense fucking score a touchdown man
alright offense we have great field position here score a td
good d
gonna need the d to show up all game this week
wind is no joke either just saw garbage cans fly through the alley behind my place
conner just doesnt have that break away speed man
ben is rusty hopefully warms up a bit
we need to worry about bens elbow
can we just take the points early in the game why go for 2 in the 1st q
diontae is so good
almost time to see how many points the steelers will almost let the bungholes score in the second half and make it another close one
i remember last week someone was like why cant we strip the ball like that and i said were really good at it
offensive line and conner both not good
currently me wondering why we cant get efficient yards against a team thats trash against the run
can big ben please get the ball over the defensive line
have we had a sack yet today
terrible coaching tee higgins is burrows guy unreal
dang juju has a drop now
jujus first drop of the season i think and its a big one
jesus fuck fichtner why
jufuckinju
cant watch the game is burrow carving us up
conner aint it we need a running back
conner aint it with any luck the steelers will cut ties with him after this season and use one of the first 3 picks next year on a running back
great play call
the killer bs of today boswell and berry
yo happy were winning and all but anyone else kind of wish wed get more tds from these possessions
watching james conner run is like watching someone trying to squeeze water out of a rock

i still dont understand his insistence on trying to run everyone over like hes christian okoye not to mention that his entire philosophy around stretch plays consists of trying to run circles around the dline until theres no room left for a 1yd gain
can we see another of our well paid running backs
alright guys how should we go about neutering the offense and keeping this game close conner runs until were forced to throw on 3rd and long i know its stupid but its our best option for accomplishing fuck all without literally kneeling every play whatever were doing it
the ball moved a lot at the end
we have been getting some good calls this year
how will the steelers win against good defenses that can shutdown juju and claypool oh idk throw to ebron dj or james washington
connor ran forward holy shit xbox record that
i say we sit ben until they get back within two scores
bring in andy dalton burrow blows
ben put too much on em
thats that good d
the left hip still bothering claypool he was slow to the sideline after that last deep ball

i think they are goodpush wash in the game now
my heart dropped
that was too close
let it roll to the 1 nah pick it up at the 4
god i hate fox announcers except romo

edit romo is cbs so yes i hate fox announcers
sacksburgh
i think spillane is just happy he got off a block for once lol
sign fichtner to a 5 year extension
if we struggle with the bungles im going to be pissed
just dogshit play calling
yea jet fighter pilot in todays wars aint super hero material


sutton needs to wake up
steelers football ladies and gents
settling for those field goals kept them in this smh


every motion is a run

how about sometime you motion and pass
score should be like 300 right now
put in anthony mcfarland or benny snell in
imma say it i like hearing vilma and albert on air maybe its just a change of pace but its like i actually listen to what they have to say
welcome to the afc north bitch
well gg guys fts but 2 of my bandmates are from pittsburg and you guys are alllright folk
i just cant believe how many of you here dont understand that we have to run the ball sometime to keep the defense honest itt just that oline is shit and conner is even worse im guessing hes done after this year

our undying loyalty to james conner will cost us some games they shouldnt start developing anthony mcfarland as fast as you can his speed and explosiveness adds another threat to this offense

his only major flaw is he isnt very big but there have been runs where if we coach him up he wouldve had huge runs that conner simply couldnt make

hey field progress is what ill take
wtf happened
why did connor cut back so far after the hand off
god our offense is so bad man
butt
holy shit that ball just kept rolling
lol
bungles showing up big time today
if that happens on a punt isnt it a safety
this wind is insane
god this wind is going to make this game all running today huh
bungles gonna bungle
so windy

man why do we start slowing that a maple syrup pour in the middle of the winter in alaskayesterday i predicted burrow will beat our secondary up hope i am wrong
lawson was holding on to ebron
too windy mane
i can only see that man as arwin from the suite life
alright time to cash in on good field position
so manyyyy commercials
blazin ben
north south baby
you too can score with heinz thick and rich ketchup from your local giant eagle
middle is open why is he throwing that ball
wtf man this is just bad play calling
i am sorry but anything over 10 yards for ben is basically moot at this point
even without the injury though landing on your elbow hurts
baker needs to do more commercials
these kicks are funny
there you go d
we need some offense our d isnt gonna be able to shut them down like this all day
there we go benny
yes please
yes
finally
wake the offense up wake them up inside save me from this boring offensive gameplan

and johnson comes in big
and suddenly were a good team again
everybody tryin to jinx us by talking about our record
damn that deep pass felt like it was never going to drop
a deep ball what is that
lets go man this game will be a blowout
ok fine lock onto dj
what a play by worshington
great catch
diontaeeeeeee
finally
boom suckah
hell yeah
now that was a great drive
that sequence of plays seemed too easy
finally a connection on a deep ball and a followup td time to school this rook and show him how its done
here we go steelers
well that was a mistake
why not just go for the xp lol
i wonder how burrow will be when hes going in the direction of the wind
lol
anyone else notice it was josh dobbs asking questions and working with ben there

i know its a quick glimpse with little other information
can someone explain to me why mondeaux is on the kick return unit
he slipped oof
anyone have a link to watch the game
i have a subscription for cbs sports nfl espn and fubo none of them are letting me watch the game
the penalty is pshhhhhhhffffffshhhhsnd
dont you dare scrap with 97
wont shut the fuck up about the lack of a bengals first down until they get a first down
hail
is it just me or do our games always feel so much longer than other teams
i missed it what happened to claypool
this defense came to play
lets gooofiioiiiiiiskawkisaknsjdwjn
my ball bitch
that was a long ass first quarter
that was fucking beautiful another
lets goooooo
they didnt earn the name bungles by accident
fumble steelers recover
fuck yeah
the bengals are shit
definitley dont recover the ball the run towards the bengals goal youll end up on come on man
abused
cam
lets fucking go
the old cincinnati dropsies
this defense is going to win is a super bowl
hell yah sutton earning that playtime with big plays after big play
can we just run some power right at them
beautiful cross body throw from ben there
anyone have a picture of ripped roethlisberger the broadcast is using
ben just pulled the entire defense with him that was great he knew he was going to washington the whole time
why didnt we just do a 3 yard out with johnson that play it was wide open
steelers are mucking the game up and i love it
i hate going 5 wide there and giving away that its a pass on 3rd and 2 would have preferred a fake end around or a shovel pass or something
i love perine hes the cousin of the one on the niners

thats my qb
nice defense
were winning the game but it feels like were losing the battle in the trenches
jesus
burnt toast
rushing three is not working
can someone explain how that was not our ball the fumble
maybe that will wake up the offense we need to score and then get a couple sacks before half
we need to dominate and then not let up
well thats the most arbitrary bullshit ive ever heard
lets get a third down conversion
lets go
finally converted as third down
oof if that was any lower that couldve been a tuddy

johnson is by far the worst player ive seen once he catches the ball he never knows what to do with it lol
they going after bens knees same old dirty bengals
steelers now entering the heinz red zone
imagine the stats claypool would have without defensive pass interference
i hate that rule fr its so weak
i saw the season flash before my eyes on that one
cant be touching ben like that
flag on the play gotta hold that guy cause hell burn you
great route there
claypool loves shit talking
theyve seen that end around a few too many times on film
ya love to hear it
goddammit come on
bens a little shifty in the pocket
finally
disgusting
what a shocker
winners keep winning
big drive
the bengals came off a bye week but they look really unprepared for some reason
cant wait until we end the sack streak against the bengals of all teams
3rd and long my butthole is clenched
and the streak continues
finally
get a body on burrowhe needs to get smacked around a bit back there
get to burrow
sack streak in tact boys
defense
the disrespect to baker lmao
kings of the north
what a catch god damned
damnit ben receivers are getting open every play
ben in ben mode
its only the 2nd quarter

crap guess its because its dark now
i havent seen anyone hit in stride like that in a long time
can we get a run in right here lol switch it up
did we score i can only find the game on fox but i dont have that
how many drops have we had today
we have to many awesome wrs to try and double the best
ebron was moving there lol
d ontae
ben is cooking now
oh my god let this offense look like this every minute of every game
yes johnson ran straight
well my earlier prediction for a low passing yard game is going up in smoke fine with me
starting to think they need to put snell in for connor
might as well keep passing bens already on pace for over 500 yards
run snell up the middle i dont care just stop using connor
trying to get conner going disrupts the flow of the offense
cant be the o line with half the pedigree and minus an amazing coach letting defenders push them back 4 yards yeah conner sucks cut him at halftime
we had a jet sweep work once and well maybe thats it for that
looked way more like a pick from the first view
there u go boz
what a wasted possession going back to an outside run play when it hasnt been working all game wow
couldnt we have had jessie bates dude is nice
3rd and 15 throw it to the line nice
hell yeah now were three scores up
3rd15 throw it 8 yards thatll get em
all you complain about the screen wrs are good enough to make that play also dont want to risk a to
i really hope we start running it up the middle more in the second half they seem to be on top of the outside runs so far
anyone know if avery is getting any burn yet special teams maybe
yeah that would be exciting if they are playing golf
holding
that buffalo punt was so bad lmao
here ya go gio lemme help you with that 1st
vince just hit joe lol
is it still halftime
has williamson played played at all
close to a block there
one thing about pi its weird to see often when a player doesnt get called but only blocks with one arm how the hell do you land just on your face
go forward
where is everyone demanding we run to the middle
derek watt sighting
the outside runs are horrible
that was a sick throw by tua
omg berry got dem hairy legs
woulda been cool to have an eight yard gain on either of the first two downs huh lol
special teams has been great so far
conner has been bad but the oline has sucked in run blocking also the last 3 weeks only road grater we have is dotson
as stupid as these slinky apple ads are still better than whats a computer
its brilliant being undefeated but with the way we call offense i cant see us going all the way unfortunately randy really is below average good teams will figure us out
ow
that punt just bought danny smith 5 more years of job security didnt it
i just wanna trust me i wanna see macfarland as much as anyone or at least snell but am is out with an illness for this game as a last minute scratch
d doing it on third downs
nahhhhhh
this kinda play should be a catch imo but the way the rules are it will prolly not be
i think thats incomplete
not fully in control of the fb and i didnt see an angle showing he got that second foot in for sure i think this stands
feet were in but id like to see another replay where we can see if he controls the ball through the completion of the play
no inconclusive evidence
5050 with time of full possession subjective but idk if enough to overturn thats how most these calls go
ball is moving too much gotta stay incomplete id think
if overturned it will be the bengals first third down conversion of the game
i dont think he maintained possession of it
i think he got both feet in but the ball was jiggling around
his knee looked broken looked so weird
but did he have control honest question because at this point i have no idea what a catch is and what isnt
what happened
looked like a bungle punched mccloud in the face when he was on the ground
theyre gonna bitch about refs after the game
again with the outside runs
forward progress
anyone counting the number of drops today
yo that ball came out like a rocket wtf
my boy clay
why doesnt this team throw down the field more
this game has had some weird playcalling like so many sweeps lol
new set of downs and a new opportunity to try and establish the run baby
ok i think they have an eye on claypool just run conner
good shit cc
keep passing
claypool lookin slick with that snag
why is the running game not working
so this claypool guy is a pretty ok dude
that was a pretty pass
ebron
not ebron
ebron is a beast man
can our receivers catch the god damn ball please ffs
wow
ebronatron
does claypool remind anyone else of santanio holmes
ebron back in all good
ben usually drills that throw
i think ebron landing on the defender helped him not possibly get injured ankle might have came down sketchy if he didnt bounce on top of him just the wind knocked out
we need to chew clock
3rd and 2 is our diciest situation how do we not have a solid play for these situations
come on ben no more overthrows
that throw lol
i love backyard ben
has the camera work been absolute crap this game or am i just getting old and need a bigger tv not mutually exclusive
that was going to juju all the way
first down juju
connor back from thr deas
connor with room finally
jc haters in shambles
my butthole itches
theres the run
hells yes
yooooooo
mapletron
i love u chase
holy moly whatta throw

oof knew i should have started ben instead of russ
im still clenching my asscheeks so hard ill shit diamonds laters
oh boy are they gonna do that again lol
theres zero pressure on ben
ill take any positive play no matter how small
gotta turn around on that shit
eh kind of a weak pi call
what a pitiful dpi
take ben out pleaseeeee
yep thats dpi
jaden use having a game
should be another pi
our offensive line has been amazing in pass blocking today its strange that we havent been able to run
lol they shouldve declined it ben bout to pick this up
lets go offense
good coverage are smoking something that was just overthrown
atta boy betry
yikes bince
classic berry punt
vince williams is a man
alright i take what i said about berry back
vinny is good for one of those a game absolute menace
i like all the targets to claypool even though a lot of them havent connected it will pay off later in the season claypool is weapon
defense is on one today i fucking love it
the defense is just beating down on them beautiful
this d is swarming
cam sutton boi
ben looking like a jojo character in that graphic
tf is yelling lol
one of these times
whats ben talking about
when is jujus contract up id hate to see him go
gotttaaaaaa have thattttt
that says all i need to know about the run game its reached an arians level bad i thought wasnt possible again
great punt
safety please
berry
bro berry drives me nuts lol
coulda been down at the 1 if he let it roll a bit more wtf tj wants a safety
push em back
blitz time
i know weve been struggling with the run game but its 3rd and 1 and youre up by 3 scores

good stop bud block the damn punt
aj green 4 targets 0 catches must really be thinking why do i want to stay here
for the ninth time mrs bueller
i was really feeling a hold in the endzone for a safety there but i guess ill accept a punt
theres bud
3rd down defense has been phenomenal today
good read bud
3 and out 3 and out
robbed
lets fo offense
giving them a redo huh refs
can we take ben out now so he doesnt get hurt
i fucking love ray ray
ray ray is that dude
ray ray has gotten so close to housing one of these bitches
i cant put into words how much i love this team
amazing patience i so badly want him to take it to the house
ray ray all pro mccloud
fuck thought ray ray had it all the way
lets go offense
that visiontiming mccloud is here to stay
ok boys time to take ben out we won
ben wants to give washington his td to complete the infinity gauntlet
there is always a free defender unblocked every run play sheesh
juju wonderful effort
44 is a poor blocker
ill never understand why teams choose to punt in situations like that sure youre backed into your own end zone but kicking the ball away takes you out of the territory where even a miracle can save you and a loss is still a loss whether its by 3 scores or 4
i am prepared to miss juju and bud like a mf after we deliver them their rings
whats the finger sniff thing juju keeps doing
mason getting ready
i take a shot very td and 2 rolling rocks per quarter pls my liver
i hate to say it but i dont think derek watt is on this team next year i cant remember one play that hes made maybe hes just been hurt
okay can we bench ben now games over
oknow i feel like i can relaxkinda
end around lol
hey sfinchter outside runs are not working
m a p l e t r o n
chae money td no 2
maple
did dj get hurt again dude was a vacuum first half but not a single catch in the second
too easy
maybe now colin cowherd wont have an excuse about us not blowing out a team this year
bengals just running down the clock
highsmith played pretty well in that series
bud
lets go defense
caught sleeping twice
robo
someone got turned around so hard it was actually pretty funny
number 9 in shambles
so what game do we break the sack record in this year
commentator cursed him into getting a sack
bend dont break defense
gonna go watch the rocket launch more interesting than this beat down gg gentlemen
quick shout out to the astronauts
oh god mason lmao
90 baby you love to see it
is it too late to trade for a rb

my balls smell
we need to bench conner dude kills momentum anytime he runs the ball
burrows a stud
im so sick of james conner
have we played a good team yet this year
put in duck
time to find out which offensive player is going to be scapegoat to blame instead of ben today
sorry if i missed it din ben totally miss a wide open reciver by throwing it out of bounds at our first drive
did we plan on using jaylen samuels at all this year
this playcalling is pure fucking garbage i am so sick of seeing this crap every week
marcus allen hes not good folks
too much wind old qb cant throw especially the deep ball got it
this offense only works with 5 receivers or 4 receivers and 1 te 0001

not a winning formula long term
were dominating the game statistically but struggling not surprised this is what happens when you dont assert yourselves lmao
we have the worst schematics in football
no late hit call on ben
hey what do you know we abandon our shit running game and good things happen we need a new back great throw ben
i swear to christ this team cant score a touchdown on second and goal ever why do we always have to wait for third and goal to score touchdowns how can an 80 team be leading by only double digits in the first half has any team thats won the super bowl ever not been up by triple digits at all times for the entirety of a season james conner needs to stop doing ballet in the backfield and learn an honest trade like plumbing why hasnt he signed up for a technical course at itt tech what kind of a world are even living in can we please just crucify randy fichtner on a cross of burning i beams like a normal nfl team even if jet fuel wont melt steel why hasnt he been strangled with butlers entrails yet my pappys steelers never would have put up with this namby pamby murmble splurtz hlarble sorry had a stroke fahr tomlin
i love connor but hes been bad today
conner stinks wow
this defense has given up 40 yards to burrow in 45 seconds
alright boys we just need to keep it up through the second half and were 90
does the fact were only up 15 and cincy has the ball scare anyone were out playing them minus our offense being inconsistent and were only up 15

ben looks way off
bens deep ball is fucking gone
ben missing wide open receivers on deep routes is bad
lets go berrys deep ball is better than bens
conner needs to stop trying to be cute
once again horrible deep ball on 3rd down

for a second i thought she said big ben was putting his arm in a sling and i wanted to vomit
burrow had all day to throw there but at least the coverage was good
damn dj just go upfield
calling an ass game on offense when will it change
why do afcn games always have such sloppy weather
dj trying to cost us the game here
also did not expect this much brooks exposure i like it
you guys should have seen the ufos flying around my neighborhood turns out it was just airborne trash cans with this nutty wind
anyone in pittsburgh getting the game its not on fox 53
of course a field goal
field goal after field goal after field goal doesnt win super bowls
ben has to learn to get the first down and yards instead of going for the home run play on 3rd down
why did we get dobbs if we arent going to use him hes 30x better than rudolf
that little shove out of bounds was a penalty vs the ratbirds
jesus take the damn point
steve nelson second greatest free agent in steelers history behind james farrior
well thats fucking inexcusable
nice watt in coverage
this is going to be like that kc playoff game in 2016 isnt it
this game is being streamed on nflcom
so when will the offense ever become consistent its just hard to watch and they make the same mistakes every game it seems almost feels like the good record is covering some bad offense
ooof our playcalling i just dont know
cam sutton is crazy underrated
why does it seem like james connor runs backwards everytime he gets the ball
i love conner but he needs to know that speed isnt his game dont know if its the scheme or if its conner deciding to bounce it out but something about that needs to change
off topic but does anyone have a ps5 digital edition just laying around that theyd like to sell
cmon lets get another 3

sigh
yea lets just give them the underneath and let them keep driving lmao
our offense fucking stinks and is inconsistent
berry can boom it no consistency though
imagine almost losing to the cowboys because we were looking ahead to this game then still not having a game plan
this one is interesting id say catch
i am getting that steeler late game anxiety again
how about running it up the gut with connor
we really needed that bye
dont run the ball ever again ever
man we keeping getting these plays where the is almost an absolute sick catch
they donated a touchdown to the make claypool seem useless with running plays fund
so when do we get away from connor he has no explosion when he goes laterally you just know hes going down behind the line he has no juke hes killing us a bit on the ground right
please take ben out
if they score another td put dobbs in lol
looked like claypool stopped running gotta run those out
calling a safety here
lets get a safety here fellas
switzer would have housed that

s
run runanyone wanna help me out with the next play
lets see what dobbs can do
rudolph is one this going to get close
why does ben love dionte so much he is so targeted all the time he aint antonio brown
ben sucks asshole right now
conner is sooooo bad lmao
no disrespect at all but is it just me or does juju look like a rag doll every time he gets hit
we arent a very good 80 team lol
thats well deserved without those bad turnovers bengals would be up already no surprise none of the elite teams are really afraid of the steelers
and this sub already on the randy hate playcalling was fine execution wasnt good
just a wild idea but moss from bills would be a nice fit for steelers
is that ryan shazier talking to ben
picking us apart
lets see how fast rudolf and throw the game
ahh yes the throw it deep on third and manageable that works all the time s

well this is where our defense gives up a field goal or td isnt it
wish we could have a slightly better offense
damn claypool drops a lot of passes
whos fucking idea was it to throw short on a 3rd and really long
villanueva is ass idc what stats you throw at me
he didnt put his arms around ben until after he threw it how is that not roughing the passer
aj green is one of the most injury prone players that ive ever seen i have to give him credit hes made way more money sitting on his couch than even the laziest of trust fund babies
conner is not starting rb material ben is having another dud game should be over already
we wont sniff a sb with this run game sadly
put dobbs in not rudolph
man our offense sucks
people really think i literally mean were not an 80 team we barely beat the cowboys and are struggling with the bungles
sit ben
tomlin cant be that good of a coach if he keeps running it like this
i have a bad feeling boys

guys please dont be mean to me or ill kill my self
the fuck why a deep shot dipshit oc
atta boyd
our offense is so fucking ass

rudolph ben
5 yards on a first down run lets throw it twice and punt
can we get rid of the play by play here its like 5 plays behind
how was that not a safety when the bengals player touched the ball before it went into the endzone and then never fully recovered possession to properly down it before getting tackled in the endzone by rule isnt that technically a fumble into the endzone recovered by the bengals
run the damn ball please
can we get a first down please
have we been able to run the ball at any point this season
aiden tate is a big receiver
i hope im wrong but i have a feeling burrow is about to unleash and start throwing bombs offense needs to capitalize on all these given opportunities rotate these damn running backs
just kick the field goal now lmao
we should start rudolph until half then ben comes on the second half after learning the ways of the defense and wreck them
jesus christ that was abysmal
throwing behind the line of scrimmage
ah shit that was targeted
anyone know where you can watch this online
need stickum for the bottom of conors shoes
this playcalling makes me want to turn the game off sometimes
i watch a lot of other games we might be the worst running team in the league
hold up we passed on 1st and we moved forward wooooooow randy
that was complete
is it just me or are the bengals defense all trying to go low and hit knees
should we just put in rudolph or dobbs now
well guess thats what we get for being asscheeks at running the ball
hey randy that play you just called 3 yards on first down as a rush is not a bad thing now if you get another 3 on a rush or a short throw you arent having a 3rd and 9 like you do half the time with your outside zone run shit
take em down again boys
is this the worst 80 team ever theyre not convincing at all im sorry but one blowout isnt enough to convince me when you cant break away i realize the bengals are better than their record but what the hell was that egg that the defense just laid
stupid 2 point conversion and now a stupid fucking injury what the fuck
and here comes another field goal

fuck this
7 minutes left the way this game has been going it might be enough time for the bengals to claw their way back in
what should i play today my series x or my ps5
gio
wait till we face a good defense lmao were gonna have to win like 96 or something cause we aint winning no shoot out
is there a worse running back than conner
i have this creeping suspicion that diontae is limas sweed 20 slightly improved but still very mediocre hands
ben having 0 mobility not having the long ball anymore is fucking hurting us really
my butthole itches
okay this is where they start driving down the field on us really easily its hard to watch but we just gotta hang on
i love mccloud but he really should do some speed training this offseason
offensive line is the worst in the league the steelers arent winning the super bowl because of it they are getting blown off the ball
bud and tj are being so unproductive out here

is a little pass rush too much to ask from the best duo in the league

edit nice
can we please get rid of randy and just let ben call his own plays
why does everyone hate vilma i perfer this over romo being a prick
removed
juju drops a lot of balls for being a wr1
removed
lmao were not an 80 team as i been saying

i hope burrow is out forever dudes garbo i could knock him out

sportsurge always works great for me
i thought this said screaming and that you were screaming at the state of wisconsin for not broadcasting the game
watching the tv media why does no one discuss the steelers being the only undefeated team instead the are talking about rookie qbs that have only won 2 games or tom brady and antonio brown living together
i guess it is true they hate us cuz they aint us

edit ok i must be watching the wrong shows because it seems like i am the only one not seeing any discussion on them
selective hearing in the two pregame shows i listened to this morning the steelers were easily the single most discussed team
im fine without the media distractions

when the media pays attention to us its like a cancer in the locker room
they are talking

but

they would love to do nothing but talk about mahomes or jackson
80 is like the only thing to talk about they arent particularly exciting or interesting
most times they talk shit about us the media doesnt like pittsburgh
i feel like we are the only team that is talked about in every pregame show
i live in australia and i have heard three australian stations talk about this weeks game

they dont even call it football but i have seen three australian sports announcers struggle with pronouncing roethlisberger
you obviously arent actually watching or listening theyre mentioned all the time

side note why do you even care the attention is completely unnecessary
let them talk about it after a championship anything else is masturbation

im on the west coast and cant find the game anywhere

fubo hulu fox nada

would appreciate any help
nflbite

where did you find a watt bumblebee ive looked everywhere
i love the bumblebee jerseys

i also love how much they irk some folks lol
i got my block letter watt throwback today too
9090
thats beautiful i managed to snag a watt color rush jersey a few weeks ago but im dying to grab this one

this but unironically
suuuuper lowkey like no key funny
tomlin should get coach of the year ben should get come back those two are facts and then tj should get defense player of the year

he never brought the ball out ball has to come out then go back for a safety
damn you beat me to it lol i have no clue
why didnt we get a safety the ball hit the return man in play and then went backwards into the end zone and got tackled
when the ball touched him it was live but he didnt have possession if he wouldve ran back into the end zone from the field of play it wouldve been a safety
same
i thought the same thing
he gave himself up when you do that the refs can call it
no possession so no safety


where is the mapletron shirt from
i love steel city shirts
that mapletron font tho lol
steel city has some of the greatest shirts for the steelers and pirates
need the mapletron shirt lol
deeeeeeeeecent
i love that immaculate reception shirt

sportsurge my dude
crackstreamscom
the same sites that people post the other 30 times this exact question is asked every single weekend

use the search function people this shit is not hard or even remotely complicated
i predict ben wont get sacked much today the defensive backs will rather defend their immune systems than chance getting close to ben and get covid
when he fell on his elbow just now i felt my blood pressure skyrocket
good prediction
that was a dumb decision to go for it just take the fucking field goal coach claypool better be okay
i understand youre upset that claypool got injured on the play but how was it a dumb decision lol
no it wasnt would have put them up by 2 tds
would put us up by 2td but if we dont convert its still 2 scores worth
lol at take a field goal its an extra point noob
grand scheme of things a 12 point lead and a 13 point lead are similar enough to call that a wash the important number is 14 to get two full touchdowns ahead going for it in that situation is probably a good call however the okay called to go for it was bad never throw a fade when you only have one down
not a dumb decision at all


thats just the color of their caucasian models as you can tell from cmc and aaron rodgers being the same color the 5 oclock shadow also makes his figure appear darker imo
thats a 5 oclock shadow on his face dummy
what do you have against being black
they want to blame ben for doing black face

ow my tongue perfect temperature
fuck those look good

poor them

pretty funny post actually

power outage happened soon as the game started in pittsburgh can anyone send me a link to stream on my phone

go steelers
sportsurge
nflbite
sample these balls
google crackstreams
i live in nz and have to stream every game only one ad and is hd


no offense but these are starting to get just as bad as the originals

just get a sharpie and cross the name out
bruh how is steeler ab trash triple b will always be a favorite of mine no matter what they went through
i know hes a super asshole but he really is the best steelers wr in franchise history and its not close
where do you get these ornaments i wanna get a couple
just put it on your tree but hang it upside down and put it in the back lol
doing it kinda early

same here bro 90 make me feel a bit better
that was me too today buddy stay strong
go steelers but thats not great use of ppes ur rubbing ur face and steelers gear with ur gloves
cuz that mf been some shit these last couple of weeks
connor isnt the issue
offensive line isnt creating any holes which makes it difficult for a running back like conor to get going
offensive line cant seem to run block this season we rely too much on outside runs which conner is never suited for because of it gotta learn to run up the gut
we cant run against one of the worst rush defenses yikes
if we could block the rush maybe
the line and play calling are the problems oline arent creating any holes and fichtner is calling way too many run plays to the outside for negative yardage bringing in snell you run the risk of a fumble
the rest of our backs are really meh

theyve been trying to sweep claypool and even he gets stuffed almost immediately the backs arent the problem lack of standout talent aside
snell seems more explosive to me


did you realize that we are leading with 22 points
stop bitching around
the score is 297 the team is 80 and averaging over 25 pts a gamecome on
what an exaggeration
granted conner is a solid running back but we need another guy in the backfield its like watching the tin man run the ball
its because they arent calling runs that let him get downhill or they just arent getting the push weve seen what he does when they get push and he isnt required to dance around
need a new rb line
conner is good when he can run downhill he hasnt had that chance this game
also mcfarland is out with illness
mostly just dont think its in the game plan right now and why should it be
we have solid rbs snell and samuels should be given a chance at least

still havent pulled the trigger on a jersey but bettis is the only one id buy maybe if we win another ring i will
niiiice love the necklace cant remember what its called but i know it is used to put a curse on opposing teams
my heart hasnt raced in the last 2 and a half hours and we have a big lead
tomlin is giving you a week off because steelers at jags is going to kill at least 15 of the fanbase
were just using one of the two annual easy games were allowed today
this score isboring lol
thats what happens when you play the bungles no worries
somethingswrongicanfeelitjpg
something wrongi hold my head
its probably because you havent been able to post a fire tomlin post this season
we get 3 or 4 easy games a year browns and bengals
why is it always ohio teams that give us an easy game
we had the 31st easiest schedule in the league before the year i think honestly it got easier

but hey we here doing it baby

love to see every skill position player supporting each other no matter who scored or makes the play especially seeing juju and conner picking players up running to celebrate hyped off others big plays such positive vibes right now thats all
its nice not having a toxic turd like ab in the locker room
im happy were dominating the bengals at least on the scoreboard but i dont find myself excited about it it feels like cheering someone on while they beat a helpless puppy an ugly stupid puppy but a puppy nonetheless

edit the downvotes are telling me this sub is crawling with bengals fans who dont appreciate my lack of respect for their team or with steelers fans who dont appreciate i dont view the bengals the same way as they do
wtf are you talking about
nah fuck the bungles
were beating an nfl team a rival that would have absolute no remorse if the tables were turned
its better than the heart attacks that usually happen on sunday
ill never get tired of us beating cincinnati that being said though im worried about how far this team can go in the playoffs without a consistent running game i mean cincinnati has the worst ranked run defense in the league and we cant get anything done at home mind you weve gotta make some adjustments in or running game or were headed for an early playoff exit

haha love it
i want a juju jersey hes my favorite player but im waiting to see if he gets an extension

are you aware of how this movie ends lol
ur missing his manly beard
kevin

they had it coming tbh
who dey think they gonna beat


the bengals sub was so full of people talking so much shit all week guaranteeing a win fawning over joe burrow and how hes going to light up our secondary dissing our defense as incapable of shutting them down all those same people are now crying about how their team has no talent their coach should be fired they need a new defensive coordinator the steelers were hitting burrow late and the refs favored pittsburgh i mean dont get me wrong im always grateful that im not a cincinnati bengals fan just especially today

edit i just saw a stat that the bengals are 0171 in their last 18 road games let that sink in for a minute
i saw that post the proceeds from the myron cope terrible towel go to educating those with disabilities why would they disrespect something their team desperately needs
there a wikipedia page documenting this


why do other fan bases even try it its yinzer voodoo
myron cope was very disappointed

thus he let down a plague of chase claypool
disrespect the towel then you get chocked out by the towel
encroachment

i mean id hope claypool isnt bryant bc id like to see him succeed for longer than a year
lol thats sammie coates replacement not minds take it how you want to i am back
bryant just upset that claypool is from the land of legal weed
yeah i bet he runs real fuckin fast sitting on that couch every sunday
claypool can smoke past the edge on those handoffs but nobody smokes the blunt like mb
maybe faster than anyone on that team to destroy what could have been a great career


we always still wanted you though bro and we just hoped that youd be able to overcome your challenges have success big facts
who
bryant may be faster than most if not all of the team however hes also the fastest to serve a bunch of suspensions for that ganja
when youre the best football player on the team in high school and college you can get away with breaking the rules and being an asshole when youre only near the top of an nfl team the leniency starts to fade
bryant doesnt even know what day it is too much bong resin on the brain
can he be allowed back
why is the quote being reposted at the end of the game
its not a foot race ya goof

its crazy that our vet in the group is 23 lmao
playmakers make plays what can i say
mr big chest catches
when ever i see 3rd i just look at juju running his route cause ik its goin to him
lets not compare him to clowns please
glad to have a solid game with no high emotion changes
i came here to post about this too a breath of fresh air

it both looks like and is not unexpected that the bengals have negative seven points
when your opponent has a physical disability preventing them from converting on third down
honestly i love what im seeing but the run game concerns me i was not a huge fan when they were up big in this game and still did empty packages instead of practicing their run plays if we want to go deep then the backfield needs to be a bigger factor then it currently is im sure theyll figure it out but i want to see it happen
anyone have a gif of them dancing on the sideline in 4th quarter also 90 lets gooooo
i need this as well



saw it from my back yard it was a great day haha
i am honestly glad that the launch was more exciting than the end of the game



edit make that 67351

thatd be a little creepy if it was a stranger
im glad to see my husband isnt the only one who does this during steelers games
a wild yinzer appears
a keeper
my husband did the same thing lmao
tree up
not much to say glad to see mason going out for clean up

here we go 90

im a simple woman i see the tomlin face i upvote
e n c r o a c h m e n t

edit til we have this flair
i love that this is posted every week cant wait for this image to get 20k upvotes with the title tfw you win the superbowl in a couple months
you know fans of that poverty franchise were waiting to say they snapped the steelers streak lol
claypool reminds me so much of hines ward with his attitude and work ethic and i love it
friendly reminder that we also won ten straight against the bengals
havent lost to them since 11012015
and are currently 193 against them in the last decade
and the ravens just lost
one day people are going to talk about tomlin the way they talk about landry and lombardi
we play anybody yet s
who ride
at this point were guaranteed playoffs right
this is the face i made when i went over to check out the bengals sub a few minutes ago its really entertaining
i waited on him once he was in east lansing msu scouting the football players and he was a joy
tfw the last super bowl the steelers won was in raymond james stadium and super bowl 55 is being held in raymond james stadium
they pulled the wool over our eyes on a fake punt enabling their franchise quarterback to get injured for the sake of 3 points that didnt matter

also they disrespected the terrible towel

dumb idiots
just speaks to the immaturity of their young coaching staff

regardless of record i know i wouldnt be giving tape of a fake punt to other teams when the attempt doesnt make any difference in this game
dont celebrate injuries you douche

ahloo ah loo

a little bit earl90
here we go
love those block numbers
see what you did there lets goo
i love this man
listening to local radio here in kentucky got the local cincinnati radio sports announcers on mason rudolph came in and they bring up that he was involved in the helmet incident last year with myles garrett and said not a direct hit to the head revisionist history trash
i hate the fact that the color commentator actively cheers during the game with his mic on i dont blame him for cheering on his team but at times i have trouble hearing play by play due to him
they also ended the game saying that they knew ben would come into the week like john wayne the drama queen complaining about his knees and throw 4004tds and they were right about his 4 touchdowns like what
i remember from clips in 2005 how they would cheer over zealously for rudin johnson

rudyyyyyyy yeaaaaaaa go rudyyyyyyyy

a lot of people were picking the bungles to upset i stopped watching espnnfl network halfway through the week because it was messing with my head i kept thinking what am i not seeing
that shook guy picks against us almost every week

watt a time to be alive
what a time to be a yinzer
does robert golden have like twice the amount of teeth as most people



are you not entertained
my boy claypool with two more juju with one dionte with a career day wowx3
thats incredible
might have to put this one on a cookie
best stawt in fwanchise histowy thats saying a watt

who is this
even this guy has an indoor practice facility
dont say him to come back on the roof maybe this time he jumpsnot a great loss for humanity anyway

im here
fuckin cake walk these idiot on twitter we beat a god damn of the nfl fuck off

this was created by a bot for issues or suggestions please message gdtbot nfl changed a lot during the offseason so improvements will be made during the season
yeah but i mean it took tomlin 9 games to get to 90


hot seat
expect peta to raise a stink after 53 men from pittsburgh just skinned cats on national television
our first relaxing game since cleveland how sweet it is lets talk it out

good

boswell alls well that ends well chris boswell absolute money

edmunds i know you guys dont wanna hear it again but he balled out was all over the field and did a hell of a job tackling the catch and being around the ball

diontae the young goat shows up man this dude is pure electricity and you can see why drops are an issue but whew he is dynamic

berry looks like all it took was his ass getting cut but he is back lmao great punts flipping the field position exactly what weve needed

juju physical this dude is just physical and will fight you for yards not even that but talk about a great teammate you talk about juju

chase claypool lets just throw all receivers on this list because we spread the ball and spread the love unreal how much of an impact he has had his rookie year i never would have believed it

tj again its cheating having him on this list but fuck you myles garrett this man is dpoy and you can see why clean stunts constant pressure i look forward to the day we give him a blank check

uncle joey goddamn talk about pass breakups what a game from the seasoned vet man not getting anywhere on him and truly had his own island

01 offense 4 wr 1 te this is our passing package where ben calls the digs aka our most successful package truly cannot he stopped of course theres a downside but does it have long term success i do not know im not one to cry about balance but any semblance of a run game would be appreciated regardless ben is fhat dude

ben hey speak of the devil give my man cpoy afc pow and mvp while youre at it nuff said put some respect on 7s name

sutton this man is playing his way to a pay day and we can see why what a stud

bad

third down o gotta be better conversions need to hit no way around it crucial to keep these drives going and defense getting some rest weve been decent this year but fell short needed to be better today

run gameol fuck i need another watch but whats the answer wheres the shortcomings we cannot run against dal and cin that is vert concerning and should not be the case gotta figure this out spoiler its not jc thats the problem

for all the lurking bungle fanswe dey

ben is your daddy

were 90

who ride
you dont disrespect the towel
rudolph will come in mid way through the 4th quarter with the steelers leading by 20


dont fuck with the towel bungles

where were u when bungle was kil

i was sit at home eating primantis when ben call

we dey

yes
i wear the same shirt for games every week until we lose and i dont wash it between wins and this shirt is legitimately disgusting and i love it
9 and fucking 0


wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
steelers point differential vs the nfl 100


steelers point differential vs the state of ohio 57
the steelers are the worst 80 team in history

fuck em all this team is the real deal lfg
its about time we dont have a heart attack game

ok easily the biggest negative is our run game that was very ugly it got better the second half but we have to be consistent


alright positives pretty much everything else i have to give props to berry he was fantastic with his punts

big ben was finally completing his deep ball still inaccurate but its getting there praise be also literally every single time ben gets a bump on his elbow the network shows a closeup and it always stresses me out lol


defense was legit but our run d is still rusty


end of the day we 90 hoe


whoooo deyyyyy
juju is life

joe haden is a stud
post the tomlin pic
fucking 90 lets gooooooo
i will say that james conner is doing an extremely good job of holding on to the football you can tell that his first priority is ball security i think hes sacrificing a little speed and some risk in attempt to not give it up almost like they sat him down and said you dont have to be the reason we win just dont be the reason we lose
i have worn my bumble bee jersey every week so far and were 90

praise be the bumble bee
fuck jonathan vilma worst commentary ive ever heard
so good this year but i think the nfl needs to bubble up soon if they expect to finish this season i will be so bummed if the season gets cancelled with our team looking like this
90 babyyyyyyy
everything was perfect except the running game
cant wait to keep being 2 in the power rankings simply because patrick mahomes exists
that was fine
in other news the sun will rise tomorrow
benvp
all i want for christmas is a run game
passing game fire

defense fire

running game what the fuck

idk what needs to happen but it needs to happen before the thanksgiving game
who would win 3 heisman qbs or 1 t h i c c boi
commentators were ass
ben passed for 333 yards 4 tds no interceptions

nice game
feels so nice to not have a heart attack on a sunday
the goal of the next 7 games is to keep ben healthy
least cancerous game thread ive seen in a long time thank yall for that
really fucking hyped but ive had enough time to bask in the win already and cant stop worrying about the damn run game
no complaints here solid game best team in years
thank you new england

now i need a shower
who dey thing gon beat them bengals
boswell is 4042 since last year
get past bills and colts and this should be very interesting
considering that i missed the browns game i cant think of the last time i saw such a stress free game from us
my 9 year old walked by during the game he glanced at the screen and thought we were playing the bagels
we dey
bengals are a joke

welcome to pittsburgh joe
can we get a round of applause for jordan berry 345 yards on 7 punts glad to see he got his mojo back
we good boys
holy defense i knew theyd play well this game but i didnt expect this
i was told joe burrow was supposed to be good lol
requesting big ben wearing a bengal skin cartoon
could you imagine being the buffalo bills lmfao
now its time to watch sunday night football and hope for the best case scenario gillette stadium spontaneously combusts
god fucking damnit this feels good wedey
the bengals are terrible like super terrible first time ive seen burrow not worried if this is who he will be
23 of our divisional matchups were comfortable wins
bungles fans really thought they would upset us lol they clearly havent been watching football for the past 5 years stillers go 90 lets fucking gooooooooo
we dey
never thought id say this butthank you patriotsew
just here to say captain fat fuck is the bengals daddy as it always has and should be
90 bitches
its so fun to win games like this i was laughing and having a good time all game but im changing our nickname from blitzburg to runrunpass
i dont know if it was
a the bengals
b the o line
c conner
d all of the above

but the run game is going to be the reason this team wont win it all that was a pathetic performance in that aspect and it needs to be addressed conner is not a starting back in this league
stopping by to say that i love seeing the ravens losing to a 35 pats team
best start in franchise history
steeler running game has been lacking recently after seeming strong early
as the weeks go on big ben seems more and more comfortable we really need to focus on this running game give the other backs some more touches
90
that game felt so relaxing and was much needed for me and my health after the last 2 weeks being nail biters onto jacksonville it is
wasnt pretty early on but the defense pass game was just as dominant glad ben looked great after getting hurt last week not practicing 90 baby
who dey think gone beat dem bengals
we needed a nice blowout like this my heart just cant take anymore close ones boys
i think the bengals twitter acc is scared to tweet out the final score lol
the bengals had 16 first downs none of those came from third down
90 and a dominant performance despite a slow start

smoking a victory preroll when i get home in the morning aw yish
you know that scene in the patriot where tavington says tell me about ohio thats ben irl he owns that state
a lovely stressfree sunday afternoon
turns out the bengals are not in fact dey
zac taylor should be fired for leaving joe burrow in to get abused like that when they were losing by 29
here we go steelers here we go

pittsburgh steelers are 9 and 0

to the tune of my favorite childhood steelers here we go chant
howd the game go

to shreds you say
the bengals sub is so pathetic haha all they do is spam fts and call the steelers dirty cheaters
imma list my takes for each phase

special teams

shoutout to st for a bounceback performance after last week
boz was the money with his kicks as usual
ray ray had a great game set the offense up with great field position and shouldve scored
bengals had no space to return coverage was great the ff and layne with that amazing tackle also
berry had an awesome game i didnt understand why we cut colquitt at first but im so down with the love
special teams mvp jordan berry

offense

ben ben ben what an absolute gunslinger missed a week of practice came off two injured knees suffered an elbow injury in game and still threw 300 yards and 4 tds two weeks straight its crazy that pff thinks hes holding us back obviously deep ball accuracy has to improve but its gotten better
wide receivers were fucking awesome today everyone got into the action diontae finally had a breakout game and claypool and juju were money these guys are a top 5 group in the league and you cant change my mind
ebron hasnt been eye popping but man is he reliable and that one handed catch was a beauty hes an absolute great locker presence as well and im so glad we signed up
offensive line was pretty good in pass blocking bengals had some pressure but ben was kept clean most of the game run blocking was absolutey horrendous every play it felt like the bengals were already in the backfield when conner got the ball
run game has sucked part of it is run blocking part of it that conner doesnt have great vision it needs to improve
fichtner is not the issue in this offense he made some good calls today but execution was our biggest problem in the first half
offensive mvp big ben

defense

013 on third down wow we need to stay consistent with this
pass defense was mostly great haden had a great game sutton blew a few coverages but had that absolute money ff nelson was pretty good too and edmunds and minkah have quietly been a great safety duo
tj watt hes my dpoy and nothing will change my mind
run defense was a bit better today it seems like a lot of the run yards came in garbage time but not having bush has hurt us quite a bit once alualu starts getting more snaps again itll hopefully get better
henry mondeaux can we give this man some kudos hes slowly improved every game and he had a great play where tj could get the sack
defensive mvp tj watt

coaching

overall much better this week tomlin is coty this year and nothing will change my mind

on to the jags next week this game screams trap game but this year has proven that we dont care about those anymore lets ride
urinating tree the stillers are goin to the super bowwwlll
more wins like this please its nice to have a relaxing sunday lol
welcome all to the big ben revenge tour
that win was cozy
lets go pats
i like it
know how there are always post game interviews where does one watch those
good ass whooping boys feels good to stay undefeated another week but i think its time they figured out we are a pass first to open up the run type of team for the second straight week rushing performance was pretty pathetic
next week we play for the kordell photoshop
seems ben should not practice more often lol
i was just reading this crazy article and it says

tomlin has never had a losing season
it must really suck to be a bengals fan
i dont think ive ever rooted for the patriots but to go along the meme of what is 2020 lets go pats
so snf do we do we root for the patriots that cant be right
my biggest concern is the number of bens passes that are being tipped at the line i cant recall a season when he has had this many tipped passes sure some of those are because of the short passesextended runs but that is something the ol can work on
breaking steelers need 3 more electoral votes to secure the division 7 more to get a 1 seed

lets be honest kansas city is finishing 151
can anyone explain to me how the bengals touched the ball at the two have it bounce into the end zone and they fuck around with it and its not a safety

i miss romo

vilma sucks
easy dub
just a curious question why do the players wear masks on the sidelines arent they all tested consistently
guys that was a pretty complete game i know we gave up some passes but they played it safe and got stops when they needed to

offense defense st all clicked well and boys we settled for 3 fgs punted on a 4th and short in bengals territory and still havent gotten our run game down and we still hung 36 and won by 26 i think we have a squad
the steelers kicked ass

and things of that nature
i know the whole steelers havent played anyone bit is an old joke now but that being said its good to decisively beat teams we should beat pretty much the whole team was clicking and if we are gonna claim to be legit super bowl contenders its good to demolish teams that we are much better than good teams do that lets do the same with the jags
idk if anyone remembers or cares bit i got mod control of rkneedeep dedicating it to boswell and shit posting in general
just here to chuckle about lamar throwing a pick at the end of the half to take a fg op away from tucker and go into the locker room down a fg to a woeful pats team
fuck every bird team sorry atlanta
9 and 0
even mother nature hates the rat birds
who dey
we need a run game going forward
lets fucking gooo we in all their heads witness the greatness
nice to not have a heart attack game running game wasnt the best but our passing was amazing and that mcleod dude is a god
what a great game
we dey
90 and my ps5 came today what a goooood day cant wait for my kid to go to bed so i can game all night
lets fucking gooooo left some points on the table this game but in all its hard to complain pretty nervous about next week but hopefully we can keep this going
great game
i wore my brand new salutetoservice polamalu jersey today not saying i deserve all the credit for todays win but
pretty sure the last time i wanted the patriots to win a game was their first super bowl against the rams this feels weird
as expected
zac taylor is probably my favorite incompetent coach in the nfl at the moment going against him feels as close to a sure thing win as there is he kicks field goals while down a million has weird random play calls at inopportune times and even looks the part of completely lost and in over his head hes accomplished absolutely nothing as a nfl coach and i think the bengals should sign him to an extension
this is what happens when you disrespect the towel chuck nolls blood and semen are blessed with each one you will be cursed and you have been warned many times
get in here 90 baby
90 that is all
90 feels good
nine

and

z e r o
90 this is the first game i watched completely this season ive been avoiding watching because weve been winning and i am superstitious as fuck when it comes to the steelers this was an awesome win and a great game to watch
90 baby you love to see it

id say gg but fuck the bengals
90 thats all i have to say
gg guys
who dey
were 90 damn it feels good to say that
i love you all 90 we dey suck it bengals
has anyone else noticed the amount of former steelers that are giving praises to this team
the purple pigeons lost to new englands b team

3 games up in division now please keep the fire lit the jags and every game after are the trap game

steelers will need a running game im not sure if connor or someone is tipping the play or if its just poor execution because the other team d is beating him to the line of scrimmage virtually every time
90 steelers on the road against a two win jags team that is coming off a hard fought close loss against a first place team the ravens loom the next thursday

the question isnt if the jags will win but by how much


colin cowherd said earlier this year that roethlisberger was the worst qb in the division
baptism complete
worst qb in the afc north and its not even close s
where can i find a version of this for an iphone wallpaper
king in the north
how can we be 90

we havent played anybody yet
we eat heisman trophies for breakfast
removed

i wonder if well go undefeated and win the sb without ever facing a good team

kings of the north

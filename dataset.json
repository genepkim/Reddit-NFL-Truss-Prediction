Atkins is still recovering from and injury, and hasn\u2019t had a solo tackle in like 40 snaps.

I don't want a retread. I want the next big thing that will take us to the next level.\n\nThe real issue for this team is poor team building.  How many of our players have left this team and became Pro Bowl players elsewhere? We have not drafted a quality team and have had multiple busts the last couple years.  I think the draft class this year has a LOT of potential but the past few years have been bust after bust unfortunately.\n\n  The defensive line injury situation doesn't help either."}, {"text": "I'm just curious on everyone's general opinions on him.

Rushed staff and first year, it was bound to be a down year. Not to mention Finley starting three games, two of which I think Andy would have won. With those two games and maybe one play going a different way in the Seahawks and Dolphins games, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that far out there to say they were a 5-6 win team.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t appear that last year was an isolated incident. He\u2019s 1-12-1 in one-score games. Generally, you see teams go about .500 in those games. Granted that\u2019s not a hard and fast rule but it\u2019s typically how it goes. So by that metric, an \u201caverage\u201d coach would get between 5 and 8 wins in those situations (14 games). Taylor has 1. He should probably have 3 this year alone (Chargers, Eagles, Colts) but he only has 1 for his tenure.\n\nI don\u2019t think the Chargers game is that egregious. They coached that game fairly well I thought. They saw Burrow get sacked 3 times in the first half and adjusted for the second half and he wasn\u2019t sacked again. It came down to your star receiver making a rare bone-headed move on a perfect pass for the win and then your typically reliable kicker having a freak miss for OT. \n\nThe Eagles game was fine for about 3 quarters. They played to not lose entering the fourth and that forced them to OT. Then they\u2019re gifted the ball at their own 41 in OT, only needing a field goal to win and decide they only need 5 blockers against a team that sacked Burrow 8 times that game. So they keep trading punts until it ends in a tie. I\u2019d also point to the end of regulation and OT. They didn\u2019t even try move the ball to win. End of regulation was a kneel down and end of OT was a handoff to Mixon. I get it was a tall ask to get into FG range with 15-20 seconds but they didn\u2019t even try. \n\nThen the Colts game. All I\u2019m gonna say that between 2016 and Sunday, teams that had a 21+ point lead were 93-0. After this past Sunday, that record is now 95-1. There is plenty of terrible coaching to point out in that game but I feel like 95-1 explains it better. Actually I will throw in the fact that the DL we had on the field for the Doyle TD on 3rd and longish did not have Dunlap, Atkins, OR Lawson. \n\nAt a certain point, these losses (or ties) are entirely on coaching. He can\u2019t close out a game and is mediocre at best managing the roster."}, {"text": "I think it's dumb to leave one of the best QB talents in the hands of a coach that is  obviously out of his league.

This is not even a debate. His only wins are against Gase, Marrone, and Kitchens. His offensive playcalling is downright atrocius. The whole staff is somebody his father in law knows. Those of you who think he deserves another chance haven't watched enough professional football (but you are all handsome and strong still)."}, {"text": "To me, there are two serious red flags regarding his ability to be a head coach in this league.\n\n1. His choice in assistants - Jim Turner has well known character concerns and doesn\u2019t have any qualifications that justified his hiring given those concerns in my opinion. Lou has shown a clear lack of understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of our personnel. Constantly playing soft zone is absolutely infuriating to watch. We are a terrible zone team.\n\n2. Attention to detail - good coaches win close games with the little things. good examples this past week are the horrible FB dive on 3rd and 1 and the field goal on 4th down with Randy that he doinked off the upright when we\u2019ve been great on 4th this year. Also, our inability to identify why we get gouged by opposing offenses time and time again in the 2 minutes before half is insane.\n\nHe comes off as a good and smart guy to me. But I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s got the experience to lead a team, especially with sub par assistants.

He's lost the locker room, he's double downed on Olineman who are undisciplined and untalented, and he can't win close games. \n\nI say after the browns game because after that we have the titans and the Steelers, so if he loses to the browns we will effectively be 1-7-1.  If he can't win a close game against a team that just got schlacked by the Steelers, he won't beat the Steelers or Titans."}, {"text": "Here\u2019s s what he inherited, Mixon, Boyd and Hopkins on O.

Two coaching staffs gave up on him, not just Taylor, we have seen Green, Dunlap, Atkins, Williams, Tate\u2019s agent, and Phillips ALL say they are frustrated. There is a breakdown between the players and coaching staff right now and I personally believe it\u2019s about to boil over."}, {"text": "It's understandable to be frustrated with Ross through the first couple weeks, but the man has basically been a healthy scratch since. Sure he dressed last week since Tate was hurt but I can't say I'd rather see Mike Thomas out there dropping catchable balls and Alex Ericson not getting open than giving Ross some snaps and a chance to redeem himself. Not only that but if you want to get an asset back for him by the trade deadline it would benefit the team to show the league that he's worth rostering.\n\n Remember the reverse that he fumbled in his first game against Houston and how the fanbase skewered Marvin for putting him in the doghouse for a season? I want that same energy for the coaches and front office right now, when they would rather fuck themselves over by scuttling any trade value these guys have by keeping them off the field, hurt their players potential at getting a good deal elsewhere, scare off future free agents from coming here, and most importantly sabotage their chances of winning games by putting a coaches petty ego first instead of letting their best players play.

Any neither wants to play here anymore. Don\u2019t bring up trades because no team is going to trade for a player with large cap hit and no production as well as being over 30 years old. We need to get over the guys from the 2015 core. Let them go and create a new core. One with bates, Wilson, Pratt (hopefully), reader. Geno and Carlos are only hurting this team right now."}, {"text": "I would do anything possible to trade and not cut"}, {"text": "Yeah, if they are going to give this one more year, they need to finish the house cleaning and rebuild that OL this off season so that there are no excuses any more. I haven't seen Geno be Geno since the knee injury personally, and Carlos has really dropped off this season after he began to show signs of age last year. Hubbard has a visible positive difference in energy when he is on the field, I am sure the other young players do too. Dunlap and Geno are either not as hungry or not as able any more, I fully agree with that. \n\nAs much as it seems like things are in the air on the field from a coaching standpoint, we are seeing the growing pains of drastic change here, and it is hard to live with. The young guys are clearly outplaying the vets though, and they are rightfully seeing their snaps increase as a result. This is what we should be expecting. You don't perform, you don't play. Hopefully the team brass takes the hint the coaching staff is sending and cuts the last of the necrotized skin off this thing so it can truly begin to heal."}, {"text": "Sure cut them after the season if you think they're washed. Benching them for practice squad caliber players now accomplished nothing but tearing the locker room apart. You could argue that you're developing younger players by giving them snaps this season but let's not delude ourselves into thinking we should be leaning on Bledsoe or Xavier Williams going forward.\n\n The coaching staff and front office have given up on winning this season and are trying to deflect blame on the guys who have worked the hardest for this organization.

For fantasy purposes it\u2019s risky to play any of these guys if for no other reason the O line is inconsistent. Or to put it another way, the O line is terrible. Boyd however is probably the safest bet of the three with Higgins and AJ having the highest chance of going off. AJ is the wildcard but as of yet he hasn\u2019t been back to his old self.

Let's look at it from a financial perspective, his \"big money\" contract is directly connected to his playing time, all nfl contracts are because they are not fully guaranteed like the NBA.  So from a monetary standpoint a player wants to make as much money as they can (playing more), which you should agree if you like capitalism. From a competitive standpoint, you want a guy on your team who should want to play.  So when a player isn't getting playing time and he can add something to the offense, I want to know. And if it were a different player like AJ or Higgins or Boyd, I'm 100% on their side.

Say what you will about production/compensation on Dunlap's and Williams' end but Atkins only getting 40 snaps in two games is unacceptable, and putting Sims in over Phillips is idiotic.\n\n I'm happy enough with the draft class and free agency, but after seeing the O-line play last season and basically doing nothing to improve it while bringing in a rookie QB that you plan to throw right into the fire irresponsible at best and criminal at worst.

Another Redditor pointed out Trae Waynes basically has the same AAV as Jack Conklin, Waynes hasn't played yet but I can't understand how our secondary was seen as a bigger liability than the line.\n\n Ultimately the buck stops with ZT and the front office and I don't expect either to face consequences which doesn't provide much hope other than hopefully he learns.

They should really explore getting a veteran defensive coordinator and staff to come in and clean this defensive mess up, we just have to hope they are willing to over pay to get a competent defensive coaching staff in place. I am hopeful, mainly because Cincinnati went outside normal operations and spent big money in free agency this offseason. Now they just need to do the same with a defensive coach and let him pick his staff. The offense isn\u2019t the problem in my eyes (spending some money in the trenches would fix all their issues in my opinion), the defense is what has been loosing them games. Remember, the situation with the Rams Zac Taylor came from only worked so well because they had Wade Phillips running the defense.

Dunlap is incredibly unhappy about his playing time and I think it's probably for good reason.\n\nLet's consider last season, the Bengals D line was effectively the only good thing about the defense, they lacked depth, and Dunlap and Atkins were the only experienced lineman in the group. Hubbard came on later in the year but plays more of a three four linebacker than a 4-3 defensive end which is a problem because the Bengals run a for three defense. Also if you consider Dunlap and Atkins snap counts last year Dunlap was the top on the defense. He would be gassed by the end of the fourth quarter because that defense could not get off the field, so his performances in crunch time looked worse than what they were. \n\nSo their solution this year was to add depth and to use Dunlap in situations where he is supposedly most effective, ie as a pass rusher.  The problem with that is that teams are still able to run all over us because we only saw one game where Atkins and reader were able to play next to each other, Daniel's has kept getting injured, and one of dunlap's best abilities is to set the edge on the run game.  \n\nAthletically he is the same player.  But he's been relegated to a role player because they think he cannot go 85%+ snaps.  Now's he's getting 10% of the snaps because teams don't get to third and long against us.  \n\nDid he have a bad game today? Yes but that's mostly the coaching.  The penalty isn't so much his fault I think that guard jumped before dunlap but they just called it against him.  He has a right to be upset but he's going the wrong way of showing it. he can still chase down RBs, the biggest problem last year was he had to do it too often bc the rest of the defense sucked.

browns fans are really mad that baker mayfield couldnt singlehandedly and magically turn around their pitiful culture

one of them even called lamar a system qb maybe he is if being a system qb means that we have set him up for success and have actively built around and supported him rather than expected him to magically fix everything then call him a system qb thats what a winning organization does

bottomfeeders looking forward to challenging pittsburgh for afcn supremacy you know as always
was it worth it
he keeps making me look stupid every offseason where i question him or have criticisms about what he can do i was saying he might not have enough zip questioned his deep ball accuracy questioned the work he was putting in this offseason then he clearly answered all three questions he reads the defense well steps up and throws dimes

his progress is just insane hes already making that transition into the russell wilson type qb much faster than anyone thought

watching him especially in contrast to baker its obvious he just gets it he understands what a good qb is supposed to do and executed those things
people questioned how hard he worked during the offseason thats a good joke
he is so much more comfortable in the pocket and way less rushed and erratic when locating an open target it looks like he is just seeing the field better super psyched about the clear work hes put in to his throwing mechanics as well how lucky are we
i was surprised he didnt run all that much yesterday lol just feeling nostalgic ha
im glad you posted this because i dont have another outlet for my observations he had a pass to mark andrews in the second half for about 15 20 yards that was just so perfect also the way he looked off the safeties to the right before tossing the touchdown to the left probably my two favorite players from him yesterday also i think he took maybe three sacks i think they probably happened because hes trying to get more comfortable in the pocket which he is i dont think he really hit his stride yesterday which sounds obnoxious coming from a ravens fan because of his stats
he really is an amazing qb last year it was clear that the he was moving so much faster than the game yesterday it was clear that the game has slowed down to him
after watching the game and then rewatching the highlights i feel like the most impressive play to me was the touchdown to willie snead lamar is just looking ball off to the left and then drops it right in between two guys just to wear snead can get it beautiful
ive been telling people for a while that all you needed to see his desire to improve was his college tape coming into his last year at louisville he had every reason to sit back and not change a thing he had just won the heisman trophy after all nobody in college football had a better excuse to rest on their laurels in spite of that there was substantial improvement in him as a passer that season better footwork a quicker release more focus on keeping his eyes downfield when plays broke down even though he couldve easily changed nothing and still been drafted high he had clearly put an offseason of work focused on his weaknesses and while he was still imperfect if he wasnt he wouldnt have fallen to 32 and we wouldnt have had to run a tripleoption offense in 2018 it was clear he did not care about his accolades only his improvement

dude has always been driven by the desire to be the best never satisfied with where he is even when where he is is the heisman or as were seeing the mvp i said leading up to the draft that he needed to go to the right team where he could learn and focus on fixing what remained of those issues but that if that was what he did with the resources of an acc alsoran like louisville hed work his ass off with a fulltime coaching staff at a billiondollar nfl team im very glad we ended up being that right team
not bad for a rb
i thought he had an almost perfect game yesterday he got even better throwing the ball than last year the only thing i didnt like was when he threw the ball rolling left and should have been picked only bad decision i saw all game
its just the browns
he only ran 7 times and the browns kept him bottled up on every run but two and i didnt even notice his poise was off the charts his pocket presence was off the charts his touch was off the charts

he was so clearly the best player on the field my only reaction to his td to snead was to just laugh any remaining doubters are either haters or racists

by the way i honestly thought the oline played pretty ass yesterday and it didnt even matter
the majority of his balls were all perfect spirals too he definitely worked on his hand placement he had that one really back duck towards the end of the game but he was under pressure so its whatever really liked what i saw
now you can support his next of season the right way
guys i think i found the impostor
its gonna be even more ridiculous this year because of dobbins speedhow do you cover dobbins lamar and hollywoodall his physical tools aside its lamars football acumen that is super impressive he is a craftsman


i woke up read a single shitty comment from a browns fan and went straight into hateful mode there really isnt a response he can give that hits deeper than the shit i through on him
baker mayfield and patrick maholmes are in like every other commerical after their performances in 2018 wheres the love for lamar i literally havent seen him in a single one
hes had some but it doesnt seem like something he places a high value on
got to remember he negotiated his own deal and didnt hire an agent to my knowledge he still doesnt a friend who does marketing for nfl players told me those negotiations go through his mom

he really does seem to only want to be sponsored by the brands he enjoys oakley he said hes worn since he was a child he has his own brand era 8 so he doesnt seem to be in a rush to sign with one of the big clothingshoe brands but his value is only going up and if he keeps this level of play up that could be a 10 figure deal when it happens
hes in this madden commercial but that seems to be it
well the way baker performs im glad lamar isnt in any id rather he focus on improving like he seems to do
as someone else echoed i think hes way too focused on winning right now also his mother is kinda his manageragent so she might be telling him not to do so and instead build his own brand also he may just have no interest in doing them tbh
i just dont think he cares tbh theres the madden ad the oakley endorsement and the heisman house ad but thats about it
hes in the heisman house commercial
i believe this offseason he was realizing that nobody cares and was working harder
its simple he just doesnt do commercials seems that hes more focused on winning and improving his game than doing other stuff just another reason to be a fan of his dude is literally working constantly to get better
he cmc and patty are in a bose commercial though its pretty much all patty
i think he did a bose commercial with mahomes and cmc that aired before the thursday night game but i cant find it anywhere maybe it was just for the season kickoff
happy for you guys and keep it up
ravens will represent the afc in the super bowl
props to you guys and mr discount double check too he was looking like vintage rodgers yesterday
big truzz congrats on beating the other purple team
adams was nice yesterday too great game

so many good things about this clip

calais dropping into coverage and turning into a 300 pound ed reed ballhawk

marlon continuing his reign as the king of turnovers ints catching tipped balls forcing and scooping fumbles etc

the defense always taking a squad photo after every huge turnover lmfao
calais going from being upset he dropped it realizing the ball is still live when he turns around throwing his hands up in celebration when he realizes marlon has it and then going oh we gotta go over there and take a pic now ok and starting to jog was hilarious
im very confident he made this play because of watching film he seemed to immediately know where baker was going to go with the ball veteran move
man if calais caught that that would have been sick
also notice how he clapped in frustration mid fall basically horizontal in the air now thats athleticism
its been said on here many times and elsewhere by people who get paid to write about the nfl but the campbell signing may be the biggest impact fa signing in 2020 and he is already proving what sort of impact he can make

in edc we trust
it was the first drive then a fumble on the next one i almost felt bad for stefanski for the way the game opened
no crowd screams to know what just happened though i will say the change in the fake crowd noise was nice i honestly forgot at times that there were no fans
that is no man he is definitely a bear in disguise
80 on the browns was uncovered bottom of screen had the play gone to him different outcome
look at the deatils ingram hyped voice


it just kinda rolls off the tongue and its definitely that disrespect to a team when your backup has to play on after a blowout
someone in a different thread called him bobby three sticks and i definitely like that
im still trying to make rob happen so im gonna vote we say they got robed
bobby three sticking and when bob goes off its a deep three sticking
i like it
the human victory cigar
i like it do it similar to the way the orioles sub put a bird on a map for teams they sweepwin the series cant remember which
and when we put him in in the 3rd quarter we get to say put in rg4 at the top of the fourth
book it
my father used to cal him rg green
on to something here
ship it
ravens are 10 when rg3 plays
how about rgmemed
so basically my dad has had a shitty year besides the obvious 2020 being a dumpster fire weve also lost mom and my younger brother all in a span of five months

as a family weve all always been huge ravens fans and ive taken over watching the game with my dad so glad they won yesterday he is a massive fan

is there anything i can do for him as a surprise theres already a cut out in the stands but its going to be hard to spot it im having trouble of thinking of something that could really cheer him up

thanks for your time
are any of the ravens on cameo you could pay for a personalized message from one of the players he likes if one is on there

sorry to hear about the struggles hope the end of 2020 and 2021 is better for you and yours
very sorry to hear that

could be something as simple as making a slideshow with some ray lewis quotes in the background just thinking how some pics of the family and everything mixed with ray talking about strength and perseverence would be pretty moving and uplifting
very sorry for your loss
this is a tricky question normally id say you could contact the organization about having him go out on the field or even come in for a practice and meet a couple players but they wont be doing that for a while they might do something like send him a letter but thats the extent of it during covid19 but outside of that anything little you put your time in he will definitely appreciate and enjoy

it was incredibly impressive that the ravens held rich gannon to those numbers when you look at what he had done prior to that game
163 for that team was essentially 386 in todays age
the raiders entered that game with the number 1 rushing offense in the league

they averaged 1544 ypg rushing during the season

the ravens held them to 24 yards on 17 attempts

the 2000 ravens will always be the greatest run defense in nfl history especially when you look at the running backs that they shut down that season
not bad for a qb
in the year 2000 you didnt need offense because your defense was more likely to gain field position

i remember a quote from ray at the time he mentioned that if were up 2 scores the game was essentially over
wasnt this more or less the tb no box yesterday

of course that kind of proves your point given the qbs
not gonna lie as good as the ravens are and as much as i love lamar i kinda miss going into a game with ray and ed hoping our defense could carry us to a 1613 win
honestly those are kinda of like joe flacco numbers pre and post 2012
that team didnt evolve into this team there are completely different teams they share a logo and thats about it

i wish i was as passionate about anything as peters is about humiliating the browns
the best thing about no fans was hearing how mental this guy is on the field hell celebrate every incompletion for a full 40 seconds lol
id love to know how many shitrelated comments mp made to obj yesterday if there was anyone on the field who would bring it up it would be him
hes such an asshole and hes earned every bit of it i fucking love him
big fan of deshon coming in and celebrating with mp you can tell everyone loves each other in the secondary
i was howling when he just stood there screaming after that play lmao
i said it during the game cant wait to hear mp go nuts big ass never ever forgetting the rams game last year
i wish more than anything i could hear every single comment marcus makes
it seems like everyone whos ever played with him loves the dude though just a super competitor who dgaf in general gimme dat all day
everyone in the league hates him but i can guarantee the team loves his play and attitude a perfect fucking fit
this play was crazy notice how peters began to undercut the route before obj even made his cut peters is known for gambling and making play like this i just worry for the day when an offense sets him up with a familiar look and then bam double move and peters is nowhere to be found




tune in next sunday as we take on the texans at 425 on cbs

it was hilarious seeing every pass breakup celebrated like it was a pick six
really miss the sizzman

he was basically the soul of the team for a decade
we need to find a way to hide a bud light for this man to chug
didnt he call obj and jarvis girlfriends
idk if this is controversial but peters is our best corner isnt as grabby as humphrey and has better ball skills humphrey is younger tho so hopefully he keeps improving
ball so hard u lives forever in balmer mp juiceman is the new chancellor
when we got peters i was at practice for football and i told my mates and we all went crazy good times
what a fucking sloppy route by obj peters ran the cut better than he did and he isnt even a fucking wr shit like this is why i hate being a browns fans especially when you have a stupid ass fantasy writer talking about how obj should have had a 100yard easy no he shouldnt have dude was lazy as fuck and is way too mentally soft
i love his celebrations lmao
obj in good position bakers accuracy just sucks
our rookie linebackers looked solid yesterday queen look what we expected but for me harrison was everywhere almost tipped a ball to a clark pick might be homer but i think theres a possibility we dont lose a game this year
i thought that chris board has some work to do he played nine snaps and came to my attention in a negative way twice once with a big missed tackle and also with an overpursuit when he had backside responsibility that resulted in a huge cleveland running play definitely the weak link in the position group so far

i would have liked to see a little more from judon as well but im fairly pleased with the linebackers especially queen
i dont want to overreact but this looks like a dynasty
ill admit i was worried about queens tackling but he proved me wrong i also loved that he wore a ray lewis tshirt to his press conference and said it was about respect unbelievably classy move and i immediately felt like this dude is an all time raven
harrison had a few bad angles on some plays trying to stop the run but im sure thats nothing he cant clean up after watching the game tape queen seems as advertised for the most part
i think the only teams we could possibly lose to is the chiefs steelers titans and maybe the patriots
in 2003 boller started 9 games and played in 11 total games in those games he completed 518 of his passes had 7 touchdowns to 9 interceptions and had a rating of 624

in 2004 he started all 16 games he had a 556 completion percentage 13 touchdowns to 11 interceptions and a rating of 709

in 2005 he started 9 games he completed 584 of his passes had 11 touchdowns to 12 interceptions and a rating of 718

ravens fans should forever appreciate what lamar does on a weekly basis especially newer fans who never had to suffer through some of the worst quarterbacks performances you will ever see
to me kyle boller was the worst pick in ravens history since he wasted the prime of jamal lewis and some great defensive teams

if boller could have been a competent qb it would have taken so much pressure off the defense and jamal to consistently carry the team game after game
he was but one is a looong shit stain that was the ravens offense for almost two decades a lot of amazing defensive squads were wasted over that time joe flacco felt like a reprieve for a while and now i barely understand what im watching when the ravens offense hits the field it still doesnt feel real to me i still expect three and out
the two worst things about boller were that he would consistently trip onget stepped on by the offensive guards and that he would often have a big game late in a season that would give you hope that he was coming around when he annihilated favres packers i thought that hed finally done it but then he was back to his regular self next season
wow honestly those stats reminded me why flacco seemed like such a godsend for so many years
lamar already has five of the top ten singlegame passer rating records in franchise history in 23 starts hes thrown 3 tds nine times while in 163 starts flacco did it 17 times hes something completely different and we should cherish it
and the guy somehow stuck around through 06 and 07 with mcnair starting and was slated to be the starter in 08 after we drafted joe lol that bit amazes me
i remember hoping we would punt so we could have ed reed get a pick 6 seemed more likely then the offense scoring
i honestly think the primary problem was billick he wasnt the offensive genius he was touted to be unless of course you gave him a rejuvenated randall cunningham and two hall of fame receivers

not to let boller off the hook but the offense didnt exactly light the world on fire when billick was given veterans like elvis grbac and steve mcnair either

the real problem with boller was the fact that the ravens actually traded up to get in the pick they ended up sending to the patriots was used to select vince wilfork never trade up to get a qb it rarely works out

edit i know technically the ravens traded up to get lamar but i think trading up to 32 is different than giving up a 1st rounder to trade up to 19
how about we dont

im concerned about our run defense this makes me very slightly less concerned
david johnson looked good too
david johnson played better anyways
booo i want them at full strength
ehh the texans dont concern me whatsoever reid called a vanilla game and mahomes didnt even break a sweat and the chiefs were in control all game long plus their rookie rb ran for like 140 and 2 tds or something the texans d is just awful plus neither of the texans rbs is nearly as good as chubb and hunt and none of their weapons are as good as the browns and we held the browns to 6 also bob is a terrible coach get ready for another game of us cruising to an easy win along with some stifling defense
texans rb duke johnson who sprained his ankle on thursday night is considered weektoweek and is a longshot to play this week against the ravens source said however playing in week 3 is possible an indication its not a serious injury

too obvious should have honed in on elliott rather than the whole d most might not know how well he played individually good try tho
you got me there buddy
i can spot that color scheme from a mile away

i thought we moved on to jk
i had already downvoted prior to opening the post i was like the d gave up 6 points ill take that all day

i got bucked
lol i enjoyed this
i missed these post
chuck clark is that dude go ravens go hokies
you tried so hard and got so far but in the end it doesnt even matter

nice try tho
you sunuvabitch

youre not wrong about the defense being a bit leaky in the first half though
he got me im ashamed to say
fuck you bitch ya got me real mad
i want one of these with jk dobbins
f earl thomas the team is most important and he wasnt a real player or a raven he can kick rocks all the way to retirement and like it

looking good

fuck that guy the new guy was way better
we have davis for a game last year and i was pretty happy with him
guy who called our game yesterday was the same guy from lamars ankle breaker game against the bengals last year right
charles davis is top 5 for in game analysts out there for me


his go to wide receiver marquise brown 1100 yards in 2017 season

his go to tight end mark andrews almost 1000 yards in 2017 season

protecting his blind side orlando brown

next to zues jr ben powers

it must really stick in his craw to watch his ou boys be uber successful at the next level while he runs for his life watching balls hit the ground

but he does have his commercials
come on were better than this i guess you dont remember troy smith
baker was a good college qb lets not act like he didnt deserve his heisman yeah hes trash now but he was good once some guys skills just dont translate to the nfl and some guys simply cant adjust its the nature of the game
really you think its upsetting to him that his close friends are succeeding
he had one of the greatest college campaigns ever
i loved shitting on baker last year but at this point i just feel bad 4 offensive coordinators 4 head coaches since hes started its not his fault he went to a dumpster fire organization bellichick would have him on jimmy g level by now
dont forget tossing the rock to lamb running the ball with perine and mixon
did anyone happen to catch the segment on his show this morning where he said he wished that lamar jackson was hurt to the point the he was out for the gameseason

he had said he was at his local bar and there were a bunch of annoying ravens fans cheering because they were winning the fans annoyed him so bad he said out loud that he wished lamar jackson physical harm

what a fucking clown

edit link starts at 1442
i have no idea who pat mayo is even after googling him

dont need to give this person any attention tbh so lets not talk about him
just a clown looking for attention dont give it to him even like this
pat mayo doug funnies gf
people are assholes sky is blue water is wet


move on
who the fuck is pat mayo
i clinked on this expecting pat mayo to be a nickname for patrick ricard lmao
could you provide a link to this

im biased towards jackson but honestly aaron rodgers should get that that last half touchdown was beautiful in such a short span he grabbed control of that game
gotta go to russ no
i voted wilson and ceh

i love my boy jackson but russel and ceh dominated
russ should get it
voted lamar cuz im actually a ravens fan unlike some of yall s
clyde is definitely winning the ground player russ is gonna win mvp this year
josh allen should be on this list he had an incredible game

wyts lives again thats awesome i was hoping theyd find a way to continue it after deadspin got blown up
that was beautiful
i fucking love drew thanks for this
damn this was a good one

still mad at those 2 interceptions vs the steelers that shouldnt have counted
1 int what is wrong with him
wait till they get some tape on him
i mean its not bad for a mvp running back
i like how his playoff loss to the chargers was somehow a death knell for a rookie qbs entire career theyve figured him out he cant throw he cant throw against the zone especially

imagine legitimately analyzing a rookie qb in only his 8th game like that

then yesterday he faces primarily zone and absolutely lacerates it
can you even imagine if he keeps this pace all season 542
its not bad neil everett
he cant throw tho
what does high score mean new high score is that bad
uthefakekmac thank you for the award
lamar needs to win playoff games to stop the doubts people forget hes the same age as burrow
send this stat to the miserable stephen a smith who has a sewer attached to his mouth and all kc and houston fans asap
obligatory not bad for a running back comment

did he tell baker that he was going to eat his children then not good enough lol
wolfe had a nice albeit quite game on sunday really excited that hes here
im almost done the first half wolfe was consistently good always in position handled his one on ones masterfully definitely a good game for dw

schultz is a good follow if youre into xs and osanalysis
you hate to see it


top 2 not 2
personally im looking forward to lamar v cam but i feel like all of these games could be excellent

view poll
mahomes but for old time sakes a battle with big ben on thanksgiving sounds amazing
jackson vs mahomes will be awesome
oh boy there isnt a thing in this world that makes me as giddy as beating the browns i was absolutely loving last nights game and i cant wait to do it again baker throwing picks obj seeing his dad the world is alright in my book
even though it was a bummer the steelersravens christmas game was a great game and im excited for the big holiday matchup sequel
chiefs by far then probably the titans and steelers
cowboys i hope we wreck them like we did miami last year ikno a ton of dallas fans
i wanna smash the titans so bad
dallas but its not on the list
chiefs steelers thanksgiving and then titans
stillers rivalry isnt the same as it used to be i think us and the chiefs will become bigger rivals over the next couple years
i dont see the superbowl listed there must be an error in the poll
chiefs titans cowboys
gimme the week 3 gif war
the steelers will always be at the top of the list unless they fall off a cliff though some of the might be me reminiscing over the good old days when it was a legitimate dog fight every game
as much as im looking forward to the titans rematch i didnt vote for it because i honestly think we are going to kill themand that its not going to matter much because it wont change the narrative around lamar until he gets it done in the playoffs as unfair as that narrative is so whether we win or lose that game the narrative will stay the same throughout the entire year

i voted for the chiefs because i honestly think that will be the matchup between the two best teams in football and we can finally get over the chiefs hurdle that has also plagued lamar since he took over as the starter
chiefs scare me and i just know its gonna be a nail biter im not looking forward to the stress im gonna feel
vs pats will be interesting because historically bill has struggled scheming against athletic qbs but lets see if that changes when his qb is cam he can actually simulate a gameplan to practice against all he wants now
this one is hard i wanted to go chiefs for obvious reasons but we beat them last year so fuck the titans it is i cant wait to stop their run and punish then for ending our run last year
kinda was bummed about that the new york ravens lost

hes just the homegirl that gets passed around cb to cb
i guess the difference between an injured beckham and a healthy beckham is about 2 yards
remember when people were freaking about losing ab and gaining obj in the north
hes seen some shit
blame it on eli baker
blame it on coughlin freddie new offense with stefanski


landry always looks solid both of them on the field along with chubb should lead to some incredible numbers honestly i dont know wtf is going on with them i thought theyd put it together by now im not complaining but i thought theyd look better than they did
these are the stats i live for
thats what happens at father son reunions
he did draw several penalties so his day wasnt that bad

yo can we get a nsfw tag on this post
i was upset your game wasnt on tv in my area
man hes looking downfield to extend plays a lot more it looks like instead of just hoofing it when it gets rough the man is gonna be a problem for other teams ahem again this year
this is porn for ravens fans and obj
favorite part of the whole video is 536 isnt that fun haha
so happy to have football back and to see the ravens get a w week one i thought they played really well offensively and had solid pass defense

i think some terrible play calling by the browns really blew any shot they had at keeping the game close i didnt think our run defense looked especially solid on any of their stretch running plays if the ravens were gashing a team the way they were running on us early we would have ran the ball 50 times lol i hope with more time together the dline stiffens up and proves me wrong
didnt know pornhub community vids had a new intro

holy hell so many outside the numbers completions amazing
that deep ball to hollywood was legit a perfect pass
over the middle for tds is our shit
wheres the 5th incompletion
but lamar didnt throw tds outside the numbers so he cant throw s
just take away the middle of the field
can we fast forward to week 3 please
so typically in blowouts we play lamar for 3 quarters and then rgiii for 1 well instead we should be playing rgiii for the first 3 quarters and then give lamar a chance to unleash himself in the 4th quarter
s obviously

i have enough blood pressure issues as it is

how come i just keep getting imgur banners and cant see the actual post
lol i saw this earlier they switched the sides of all teams go up and down the list and you will see the records should switch sides
do i have to download imagur to be able to see this

matt waldman has been in lamars corner since the draft he called it
totally agree with matt here

when he lights teams up through the air this season again a lot of people are going to talk about how he finally learned to beat teams through the air its bullshit confirmation bias he was great yesterday but he also threw five touchdowns last year week 1 hes always been a good passer yesterday wouldnt have looked out of place at any point in 2019
matt waldman is 100 right about this 100

lamars pocket poise pocket movement and pocket management were all outstanding in college he used to climb the pocket like a vet as a 20yo junior in college the pocket poisemovementmanagement that lamar showed against the browns shouldnt be viewed as improvement he had it at 20 years old it was the 1 reason why i loved him as a prospect coming out of college

what has improved from a technical standpoint he has refined himself big time his footwork launch point and stance are all dramatically better his technique from a fundamentals standpoint is far better now than it was when he was in college he is getting better from a route recognition standpoint he rarely gets tricked by underneath coverage these days his throwing on the move in that browns game was amazing as well that has improved

the point is his pocket posepresencemovement were all great even when he was a rook waldman has an rsp film room up detailing lamars ability to consistently climb the pocket and manage the pocket in an efficient manner he made that video when lamar was a junior in college thats what he is talking about
its revisionist history to suggest that this is not a sign of lamars development hes clearly gotten better as a pocket passer during each of his nfl seasons

throwing against college secondaries throwing against nfl secondaries
i dont keep up with college football too much so it baffled me when i looked back and saw that lamar had a 6927 tdint ratio in college the way people talked about him youd think it was closer to 11 hes always been pretty good at protecting the football and id honestly value that over a couple extra passing yards that the other qbs had
zeus did well against myles garret
didnt everyone agree he could make readssee the field as good as the rest of that draft class i definitely think his motor skillsarm have developed closer in sync with his vision over the past two seasons though
jackson said it took him a while to even get used to what a nfl football felt like

ignoring how hard he worked to improve himself from where he was at in the 2018 preseason is dumb as shit
this is stupid players can improve and lamar obviously has saying a guy has shown clear improvements isnt a slight at all its a complement to the hard work the player has put in to get better
love matt waldman but i respectfully disagree with him on this one
i never questioned how he worked the pocket i questioned his ball placement and the consistency of it


he has shown strides in his ball placement for sure
ok lets get this straight lamar has definitely developed vastly as a pocket passer since entering the league hes a completely different player than he was at louisville lamar at louisville was not amazing from the pocket he was just better than people gave him credit for he was still inaccurate and had bad mechanics and tendencies and made some bad decisions the issue was people using this to write him off as a run first qb or a wide receiver however saying hes always been this good is just insulting to lamar dude has put in serious work and countless hours and reps to get himself to this position of being a top 3 qb

we have to enjoy our year of bowserthemed shitposts before some goober out there decides to hand him 18 million per year

this is from one of my favorite video games all time mario party 2 for n64 the lord bless you and keep you you wonderful human being
this meme is so on point lol
100 the best mario party


thats a cool story go mom i wonder if she plays
she also got a pair of cleats signed by her freeloading child and a controller with a ravens faceplate


so lets watch the tyus bowser sack on 4th and 4 in the 3rd quarter tyus plays it beautifully delaying his pass rush until the lt takes his eyes off him for a split second looking to see if he can help with a doubleteam you can see the exact second tyus goes in for the kill and beats his man here

but i want to show you whats happening on the other side of the field at the exact same time

jimmy smith marlon humphrey and marcus peters all line up against this bunch formation from cle you can see here in the split second before the ball is snapped the three are discussing assignments and routes possible from this formation keep in mind we have no tape on this team right now sure we have last years stuff but nothing under this new coach new offense with new players

their talks are interrupted and wordlessly each one peels off on a different receiver right as baker is looking in landrys and hoopers direction the three essentially worked out this mess in the split second it took to snap the ball and get moving

one of the major criticisms of baker is that he doesnt keep his head cool when he loses his first option in this case jimmy took hooper out of the equation and peters took out landry baker panics right as bowser makes his move on the lt and forces baker to roll out if baker doesnt panic here he likely sees njoku wide open across the middle for this first down before marlon can get in place to defend him while tony keeps stride with obj across the traffic

these 5 players together sacked baker and it is an absolute thing of beauty
the browns ol when they see tyus rush right past them
what this shows which is an even greater testament to our coaching staff is that this is a route concept straight from the matt rhulejoe burrow lsu offense we already have the tools and know how to beat what may end up being the trendiest playbook adjustment of the season against a player that should be able to pull this off in a shortyardage situation


ol grades were bozeman 69 brown 67 stanley 65 skura 52 phillips 41
i wish we could get separate grades for before stanley got hurt and after to measure his impact

sick dude
odell heard footsteps one play for a 1st down hes soft
these jokes are so dead already it was funny for a day or two
after putting baker and the browns where they belong squarely at the bottom of the afc north do you think the boys will have a similar demonstration against watson as to last years meeting or are we looking at a potentially closer game lots of positives from week 1 but im going based off of the discussions today from every sports broadcast blaming baker and obj for the win
by winston im assuming you mean watson and yea i think were probably gonna blow them out again no hopkins means were probably gonna shut down their pass game im not really concerned about that cuz im pretty sure our offense will score every drive the chiefs offense didnt even look like they were trying and moved the ball easily im predicting 4517 or something where they score a few garbage time tds late and we pile up on them early
watson is infinitely better than mayfield but hes not surrounded by as much talent as baker the key for the game is to stop the run game
probably the texans were horrible on both sides of the ball on thursday they only padded their numbers because the chiefs took their foot off the gas
its gonna be ugly 50 burger incoming
im sad cause i have to play will fuller in fantasy hopefully our sweet princes take it easy on him and let him score one time
man this sub got cocky it wont be a blowout and we need to tighten the run d cause dj looks rejuvenated

we should win however
maybe not that similar with a blowout like last year but probably a comfortable win ravens had a decent bit of mistakes yesterday they still need to iron out browns game wouldve been closer if browns wouldnt have brownsd it up so many times see baker staring down man before int fake punt fumble 4th 41 3rd down drop followed by missed easy fg

i have gotten pissed at harbaugh in the past for leaving lamar im too long that being said this early in the year you need to get lamar as many reps as possible before week 3
there is a reason why he is a long term coach of an nfl team and i fix cars
he really doesnt even need to defend this even though this was week 1 everyone needs reps this is essentially getting him back to game speed
lamar didnt get a preseason so i dont mind keeping him in an extra drive or two past when we probably should have taken him out
this is hilarious like half of bradys career stats havent come in garbage time in games where the pats had already obviously won
coach you dont have to defend a damn thing to these ppl get as many reps you can get in i dont hear anyone talking about mahomes playing the entire game and they were up 317
i cant believe this is even a controversial topic

you guys are up way too much pull lamar earlier its not fair for the browns
i agree to an extent he can stay in but should be handing the ball off or throwing quick slants minimize any chance he gets hit in garbage time

he took a trash time sack yesterday and i winced
we play like last year hes gonna have tons of 4th quarters off

dont mind him staying in gotta knock that rust off for week 3 we should be 21 against kc play calling lost us that game lowkey
sean payton would be so proud coaches who dont give a fuck and will do anything to put their foot on their opponents necks
i dont mind if jackson stays in hes an adult if he doesnt want to be in there by all means he can say so if hes still in i have 100 confidence thats where he wants to be hes not scared of injury and yall shouldnt be either more qbs get hurt inside the pocket than out of it shit happens let em play

he is also the best owner in the nfl
i guess paul allen died didnt he
yea im like 200574324 on this list
lets throw out the fact that greg roman exists

view poll
depends on the team and coach really
lamar would still be good but no other organization would have completely went all in like we did the ravens and lamar wereare an absolute perfect fit
i dont think other franchises would give as much as the ravens have to build a team around lamar
yes the dude is a fucking talent and a half

i get we have good coaches but he does nothing but smash expectations and put the work in himself im not sure the browns would use him right but i promise you theyd of finished every year with a better record if they had drafted him

just as good is subjective to a lot of variable changes had he landed somewhere else

i do think were not the only team he could win a championshipmvp on but i desperately want us to be
lamar would still be tremendous but the caveat in your polls 2nd option is that he would be just as good i feel is false

i dont think any other team wouldve had the guts to structure the offense around him and his strengths teams going forward though will definitely learn from what the ravens have done and will probably be more inclined to do something similar
with certain teams hed be nearly just as good with the jets dolphins bungles etc still good but wouldnt have developed near as much as he has in 15 years at bmore
depends he would thrive in a very select option of teams
if he goes to the browns hes trash that much i know
you know some idiot team wouldve tried to make jim a wr
still good but not at this level but we built our offense around him instead of trying to make him fit into an existing structure
some teams he would be great others merely good impossible to predict though i dont think lamar was ever going to be a bad qb he is a good thrower and always has been every rookie qb struggles passing manning sucked ass as a rookie and i am tired of that being the excuse for all the shitty evaluations of him coming out of college
i think he wouldve looked good with jacksonville when they were sacksonville another team would be the titans him and henry would be insane
i think he would be just as great on a handful of teams i think he would be very good on most teams i think despite his one of a kind talent some teams would destroy him and his potential most notably cleveland
my vote is to cheer for the bengals because fuck baker thats why
definitely bengals i like burrow and he will probably be real good unfortunately

if the browns lose to the bengals after the ass whooping we just handed them im expecting a very entertaining collective meltdown from their team and their fanbase
were not steelers fans in their own stadium we dont cheer for divisional rivals
tie lmao
i dont cheer for either and just let the chips fall where they may

i fully expect the ravens to have such a divisional lead at the end that the outcome of this game will be inconsequential
the only thing im rooting for is both teams imploding 5 missed field goals or extra points 10 interceptions during that game all that sort of stuff that i can watch and laugh at
i kinda found myself rooting for joe burrow on that almost game winning drive i think id rather root for him than baker
bengals it really hurts to say i dont hate the bengals like the rest of the division right now but the hate just isnt there and there is nothing that would be better then the browns having another losing season
both teams forfeit
bungles cause i like burrow for now and it will be funny to see the browns be 02
nobody we are ravens fans
the bengals if cleveland implodes we are for sure winning the division
i say bungles just hoping there isnt another hail mary win against us again this year
tieor better yet burrow outplaying faker
bengals i hate the browns

bengals so i can peruse the browns sub after and listen to both the baker defenders arguing about how odell sucks and the people with a brain arguing that baker is no longer a viable qb
bengals and big joe b
bengals i dont hate them that much anymore cuz weve owned them recently but when they were our dads i hated them so much also 4th and 12 fuck dean pees
bengals because fuck the browns just a bit more plus i like burrow a bit mostly because if the browns do lose especially if they play badly doubly so if they get their ass kicked again well see the mother of all meltdowns from their team and especially fans if the fans are already turning on baker and obj for losing to baltimore if they lose embarassingly to the bungles well oh boy
im not cheering for anything but super fuck the browns


nah but i feel like the browns have more of a chance to turn it around and become somewhat of a threat so id rather they fall back in the division even more
root is a strong word i expect the browns to win the bengals played some seriously garbage football in that game which i watched most of while the browns lost i felt like they made more plays than the bengals did and the browns had clear upsides like a lethal front seven and a strong running game the bengals looked like trash at every level
im a big oklahoma fan so it sucks seeing baker struggle as much as he has obviously im happy that we have been getting the best of him in our matchups which is nice
i dont care who wins i just want burrow to play better than baker lol
bengals if i have to choose i hate them a little less than i do the browns
browns so our win looks that much better

who cares according to browns fans baker will be gone in 3more weeks along with obj
he needs to work on his own game instead of talking about the mvp of the league faker keeps doing commercials while lj keeps working on his game get u sum of that faker
lmao what a goon
bitches talk shit gs grind
minshew is everything baker grew up wanting to be
this was last year or in 2018
did that short commercial actor actually say that wtflaugh out loud
i love odell and will never forgive baker for just wasting years off his career

baker will be commentating next to brady quinn here soon




but theres no full picture of that ravens controller and i gotta see it
lets all watch him jump the shark
fuck big ben all my homies hate big ben
giants 2320
oh fuck i forgot theres football this early
nice delay of game ben gonna argue with the ref over that
shitsburgh and fat ben have no chance against us
the thing im taking away is that fowler and herbstreit are going to be amazing for our mnf matchup against kc and it sucks they cant be permanent cause of their cfb gig
steelers time to play down to inferior competition
fucking sucks that we dont have sizzle anymore to out him on his fat ass that was truly one of my greatest pleasures to watch
dupree owned the giants
the steelers look terrible they completely suck

we gonna eat them alive
so far he really sucks
good ol rapelesburger
just curious as he wants a big contract

also was good to see earl thomas making the same plays he did for us last year
yes i know this because i remember a penalty bring called against him dont remember anything else though

joking aside if hes going to make big plays id rather he make them in close games instead of ones where we win pretty handily
nice shit post
hes gonna have two big games a year to make his season stats look decent then people will say something that he has 8 sacks and blah blah blah

i hope the guy is gone next year he cant produce his own rush unless a dumb team makes a te block him if only we kept z smith we are paying this man 16 mill to be a well imagine if we didnt have him kind of guy our pass rush has been shit with him will be shit without him at least we can get someone who can set a damn edge


rant over sorry lol
yeah dont you remember the uncatchable ball on 3rd 12 roughing the passer penalty that put them in scoring range
comments on this post are toxic af
dude wants top lb money without playing like a top lb its the perfect plan on his part if it works out for him honestly
ill be disappointed if we pay him big with all the upcoming contracts we cant pay a dude like that
he had his weekly rtp called on him at least some things never change
only notable thing he did yesterday was a retarded rtp in the first half after baker had clearly gotten rid of the ball other than that he was a ghost all game long
the fact that he has campell wolfe and bwills on the inside yet stil cant generate pressure is absurd he cant produce an ounce of pressure unless hes against a badrookie te or a reserve lineman he cant contain the edge to save his life despite it being it being a major part of his job if this fo is smart which they are and i have faith in them hell be gone this year and well draft a deor two in the early rounds this draft under no circumstances should we pay him a new big contract
but hell probably get his two games where he goes off and pads his stats like normal and someone else will pay him big money if only we had kept z smith
for reference judon yesterday was outplayed by both of our rookie linebackers which judon is technically a linebacker as well harrison had the same amount of tackles 4 and a pass deflection queen doubled his tackles with 8 got a sack and forced a fumble judon only got 4 tackles despite being in his 5th year

he only shows up against shit competition maybe 4 times a year to pad his stats
i thought the same thing he did more harm than good when he does not get a new contract from us and signs for big money somewhere else i will remember days like yesterday

this is the content were here for keep it up
the irony is that that sandys angry cause they were dissing texas lmao
i would love to be able to make stuff like this what programs do you use
ah the gif game is back cant wait to see the gifs and memes for chiefs week
living in the austin area makes me mad i cant go to this game
literally our longest road trip of the year lol crazy
i wish i wasnt poor so i could give you gold perfect
meet me outside the bank energy
my wife and i were going to go to this one
you should just keep updating this week by week elite gif here
holy fuck this is funny
i love this subreddit lol
just make sure they dont start stealing signs like their trash can of a baseball team
keep this going from week to week with patrick being the previous team and spongebob being that weeks team
as a ravens fan who now lives in houston i feel this
awesome now where is kc
this is fantastic
high fucking quality

quality gif work right here fuck the browns
yessir gearing up our gifs for week 3 i see you
not worried about this game weve proven we can beat the texans and we play them now without deandre hopkins who is lighting it up in arizona no one is afraid of brandin cooks and i think our rush d can contain david johnson will fuller is a good wr but i think our secondary can contain him too the texans d is soft and i dont see us having trouble moving the ball against them i think we can put up another 30 points

lamar vs deshaun round 2 in the nfl anyway
i never wheezed in my life until i saw this lmao
i mean its pretty relevant and i cant exactly go to the rnfl thread and spam fuck the steelers
big ben looks like shit you love to see it

edit so much for that
i dont know about a specific thread for the steelers but i would like a thread for all the other games that are not ravens games
these commentators suck they keep sucking off the steelers
steelers do look like trash aside from their dline glad our boys have a bit of time to mesh on the ol before facing them
anybody else wondering why the announcers keep making the claim that steelers look like superbowl contenders like what do they even see its the giants lol
steelers look very average yet espn cant stop sucking their cocks i used to like herbstreet but cmon man get off your knees
doesnt matter steelers arent contending for the north they look like hot garbage
i love this so much the steeler look like bootycheeks
ben looks bad so far d line looks scary hoping the giants o line is just bad
nooo jones was doing so well
this is now our mnf opening game thread why not
lmao ight so they basically have

ancient ben

not ab

not bell


welcome to 610 steelers
nobody is going to stop you from making the unofficial game threads lol
the fact that ben isnt throwing all over the garbage giants secondary is very telling of where his arm is great sign for us to easily take the division
conner hurt again this is my surprised face
that red zone interception was just catastrophic
go broncos
i thought the steelers were super bowl contenders isnt that what everyone in the national media was saying i guess everyone forgot how washed big ben looked even before the injury
the giants actually looking pretty good
steelers d at least the pass rush seems pretty solid
this steelers defense is scary
remember when people thought boswell was good
fuck the steelers
the steelers look like theyve figured out the giants defense

lol no you youngins are spoiled many of us survived the early 2000s boller years we can watch any offense
lmao dude i lived through dilfer boller grbac and late stage flacco i can watch anything
youre talking about pittsburgh arent you squidward
were spoiled for sure but after that tennessee game im always reminded of that humble pie i dont ever want to eat again
we are being spoiled stay humble fuck the steelers
those bad flacco and kyle boller years are still fresh in my memory no chance im ever going to take this for granted
theres at least one play a game where lamar does something crazy and jaw dropping i look for that in other qbs and it just doesnt happen outside of like 5 other players
i guess you werent here when flacco was our signal caller i loved him with his occasional magical plays
lol they just said the steelers offense was looking good and i laughed out loud
there are a couple of teams i can watch it was kinda awesome watching d hop catch so many balls yesterday but i definitely have twice as much fun watching our guys
i still grit my teeth and curl my toes on every drop back you can thank about 90 of ravens qbs for that one im getting ptsd flashbacks to kyle boller chucking the rock directly in to triple coverage but thank goodness for lamar
football is football ive always enjoyed watching the ravens more than every other team so its hard to say getting blowouts on a regular basis is pretty wild
i just watch the 49ers cardinals chiefs saints

theres too many amazing characters on this team i literally love them all
does top two not two mean hes 1
i love you

me to lamar and mark andrews
ravens qbs and ravens tes name a better duo ill wait
feel the love
power couple
anyone know any updates of ronnie stanley
decosta bought him chicken tendies and stanleys ankle was instantly healed
harbs said he will be practicing wednesday
not serious never even took his cleat off for the injury there was just no need to keep him in
from what we saw in the game he stayed on the field after the injury and wasnt taken into the locker room if it was serious or if he was in that much pain theres a 0 chance he stays on the field we also were already up big so there wasnt a reason for him to go back into the game so him not returning to the game wasnt weird i actually think it was great we got fluker some game time so although harbaugh almost always downplays injuries i think the optics on this look pretty good
i was told its a sprained ankle
harbaugh said it wasnt serious but this would not be the first time hes downplayed a significant injury

im also waiting for real news about this
lets see it

view poll
id rather shit myself on a first date then pick an option

come on its the steelers and its not close as much as ive hated them over the years you have to admit that theyve done a great job of building a team in some ways theyve done even better than the ravens you have to admit the steelers have never struggled to draft and develop receivers the way we have ill never forgive tomlin for that bush league move against jacoby but hes led winning teams and dealt with problem players theyre like the soviets in the cold war they were the bad guys but at least theyre playing the same game as we are for the same stakes

wheres the none option
fuck the steelers tho
ill take the zero
you can respect and hate a rival at the same time thats what makes a good rival the steelers and ravens is one of the best rivalries in football
there are people out there who actually respect the browns i dont believe it
i hate the steelers but i also respect them a lot especially when the teams were basically mirrors of each other from 08 to 2012 both teams were two of the most hard nose play defence run the ball teams in the league and both consistently draft well fuck em but they will always be our biggest competition both the ravens and steelers front offices are just a different class of organization
i mean fuck the steelers but its the steelers by a landslide their ownership and front office much like ours assure that they are consistently competitive
ravens i mean duh
only one of these teams is wellrun lol taking ravens fandom out of it the browns and bengals have done nothing to earn respect from anyone in ages
seems a silly question the other two are just terrible
clearly we have and always will respect the steelers most of any team in our division but seriously fuck the steelers
fuck them all
steelers defense really held saquon barkley to 6 yards but thats the giants line not giving any space for him to work with but all of them are trash
i was looking for none of the above so i can choose it
i bleed purple and i hate the steelers so fucking much but damn that dline looks vicious i think they used to play ball so close to how we played now they cant touch us but watching them play i do think damn that dline is sick other than that fuck the steelers
fuck the steelers love to hate em all respect
this question is bad you ask us to pick a team in our division and yet only list 3 teamsno ravens
bengals but only for burrow
recently came to the realization that the bengals probably my 2nd favorite team theyve had tons of players over the years ive loved their fanbase is always cool they hate the browns and steelers as much as we do and if were being honest ravensbengals is by far the tamest divisional rivalry in the league it seems forced whenever people try to drum up hatred for them on the same level as the steelers browns and patriots

so yeah bengals cool in my book 1416 games a year



uhhh what
they won their game tonight though
my favorite thing to see after a good game is who got the game ball who got it this time
coach mentioned them in the post game calais got one and maybe jk let me go find out



dick cass
calais campbell
lamar jackson
i loved watching football i could watch any football game no matter what teams and almost always enjoy it even two bottom tier teams playing a random thursday night game was exciting then the ravens drafted lamar jackson lamar harbs and roman have made our games so exciting to watch that i cant get excited for other games outside of a few teams normal football is barely watchable i mean why are other qbs so slow why are other teams not as cool or fun as the ravens lamar has officially ruined football for me thanks lamar
haha lamar go fast vroom
having a true all time greattm on your team will do that a bit there is a letdown when ordinary folks play
louisville fan here i havent enjoyed a nonlj8 game in years theres a support group that helps we meet on tuesday nights at 700
it was pretty fun watching the chiefs on thursday but that game was a bit one sided i tried to get hype for brady brees but honestly it was underwhelming old man football tonight i was having fun rooting against the steelers and titans but alas they both won booo i need more ravens
i love watching teams i hate get beat and going on their sub reddit game threads and just seeing them cry especially when they play us and lose and they get to see how scary lamar actually is smh people be thinking lamar is some kind of myth until they see for themselves
i mean why are other qbs so slow made me lol good post
unless its mahomes rodgers or wilson i dont even bother watching other games

although i did watch the rams for a bit just to see what 5 billion looked like and ill watch the raiders first home game to see that stadium too
tennessee v denver last night i kept thinking to myself why dont they just score the touchdowns and why dont they just do the offense thing and realized ive been spoiled after 2 decades of putrid offenses
i highly doubt ravens chiefs or ravens titans will be boring lamar and the ravens need their a game for both of these games
watching the titans v broncos last night and the missed field goals made me value tucker even more than usual same goes for lamar watching crap qbs makes me super thankful for lamar
i said this last year i find other games like watching paint dry the steelers game last night was awful to watch
defensive battles are cool
this probably isnt a popular opinion but i think the games are a little boring now after years of watching every ravens game come down to the last play for what seemed like every week its weird to easily beat teams i barely watched after the 1st half the game vs the browns it was already over lamar is amazing and exciting in his own way but the anxiety of the game is gone the excitement is a little lesser because im not on the edge of my seat as the team teeters between a win and loss nevertheless go ravens
its like when curry started the 3pt trend now everyone wants a running qb
funny enough it used to be the opposite the down flacco years i could barely remember i was watching a football game it looked like we were playing a different sport now were playing a different sport but in the cool fun way
someone said after watching the texans chiefs game that deshaun seemed so slow compared to lamar

i thought it was an exaggeration until sunday when i saw lamar go mach 5 in the backfield
give it time all the qbs are scoring rushing tds now
he has ruined football today just like michael jordan ruined the nba in the early 90s once you watch these two good luck feeling entertained by anybody else

annnnd theres my new fantasy name
random thought almost a year later afaik the nfl prohibits changing your jersey number midseason anyone here able to help me understand why it was allowed in this case
i think they allow it when a transaction happens like a trade or free agency pickup they just dont want everyone changing their number every week when nothing in the roster is changing
marcus peters would have intercepted the number anyway so you might as well just give it to him

still fukin got it
it is hard to watch gostowski tonight
so happy he got a ring as a rookie plus had clutch kicks 44 on fgs and 1616 on extra points also the funny since we won fake field goal attempt in the super bowl
probably my 2nd favourite raven behind lamar and even then the gap isnt as big as youd expect
lets not forget the contributions of the wolfpack as a trio best in the league by a mile
i solemnly swear i will never take him for granted dude is automatic and an integral part to this team were almost guaranteed points if we make it to the 40ish yard line
in jus we truss
i was kind of hoping he would get to try a long shot in the browns game with that big lead and a quiet stadium late in the game i bet he coud have made 6570 yards just to rub it in hes done it in practice
remember when he kicked it directly over the upright to beat the patriots in 2012
we really gotta do whatever we can to make sure this dude is a lifer here
oh man after watching this game tonight so grateful
im just curious how many years he has left until the hell hounds come that demon deal had to be expensive
as i watching the game i was literally thinking about how lucky we are to never have to worry about the kicking game seeing seibert blow it really reminded me how great we have it
tucker deserves a spot right beside ray lewis when his career is all said and done
and now the browns have cut seibert after that dismal performance
justin justin tucker tucker
thank you god for giving us lamar jackson nd justin tucker
watching gostkowski yesterday i was telling myself how much of a luxury it has been to have this guy kicking field goals for the ravens for this long if cundiff never missed that kick in the afc championship who knows maybe tucker never falls to us
justin still fucking got it tucker
i got my first jersey this year and its of tucker he is god sent
my friends always tease me because i draft him early in fantasy he consistently puts up points and is one of the greatest ravens
still fuckin got it
a friend made a billy cundiff joke to replace gostkowski yesterday do you think we sign tucker if he makes that kick
theres no debating hes the best kicker ever vinatieri was amazing but tucker was way more efficient and just as clutch
i think gostkowski knew about the tucker conflict between myself and you all i mean i find it hard to be a coincidence that he was so bad his first game with the same exact team that upset us in the playoffs last year combined with the fact that hes a kicker like tucker
i just wanted to drop in with respect for this beast was arguing with a scrub today and i used tucker as an example of a player at the top of his position his response tucker isnt even that dominant

like what who the fuck believes that that would be like saying pat mahomes isnt dominant as a qb its common sense some people are salty as fuck about talent that isnt on their team or that disproves their point tucker a bad bad man

1st and foremost he did not say fts so hes not a ravens fan

2nd im not even remotely american so what do i know right but this dude represents everything america these days
bet hes still in orange thursday
i was just about to post this
i cant believe this human tumor still gets views

anyone with two eyes and a heart is a lamar fan
come get the man on a team friendly contract
jesus christ the replies
game respects game


can hanes has had this motto for a looooong time dont think hes saying this in support of lamar
actually a harbaugh thing
jj watt you are no white knight you are just a white thieving robin hood stealing phrases from lamar jackson and passing it on to your world

the nfl advertises all its primetime games dude
i mean what are they supposed to say this game sucks but you should watch it anyway
i mean personally its a matchup im still excited to watch maybe these teams arent on our level knock on wood but it may still be a good game i dont have such burning hatred for other teams that i get pissy when the nfl advertises about their game


we got football man

this year has been a fucking shit show lets enjoy the good things
nfl watch two teams who suck at drafts go head to head in this battle to be the lesser of the two most over rated teams in the league
they could go with someone is gonna get a w but with these 2 teams i could see a tie happening
joe winless burrow goes on the road to baker at home mayfield

just seeing this only reminds me that they tanked on accident and that cleveland has ruined any career success mayfield could have

people keep bringing up the penalties in objs defense but they were for what like 30 yards and 2 first downs what a game changer
this isnt surprising hump is odells father
he was even banged up out there
a dad playing sports with his son you truly do love to see it
the ravens intentionally fouled obj when needed to prevent him getting any rhythm in my opinion

they knew they could get in a his head and screw up the entire browns offense
i know it was just the browns but thought it was worth pointing out only the packers scored more points last week with 43 the patriots were 2 scoring defense giving up 11 points
even though i use the expression myself its just the to be honest i dont like it its just the browns until those scrubs fluke us out of a win and a 142 teams last loss was to just the browns

i hope our guys were proud of this statline despite the team and try to build upon it going forward thanks for the stat
i mean everyone is riding the greenbay packers success right now they put up some amazing numbers but i am convinced that we on average can keep a solid defence and good scoring offense up all the way until november and once the cold weather comes well we know where this is going to end
and it was just one game long way to go
highest point differential yet still behind the chiefs who we scored more and allowed less than i dont really care too much about the power rankings especially not at the begging of the season as it will probably make more sense as the season rolls along

well ricard helped thats not an easy assignment
boyle is definately one of the most underrated tight ends in the league
compared to whatever the hell evan engram was trying to do to tj watt last night thats elite
when we resigned him to that 3 year deal there was a lot of talking heads saying we overpaid because people only look at the stat lines

i remember someone maybe one of the coaches or an analyst who actually watches games said having him on the field is like having an extra guard out there and this was a great signing then it came out that there was a strong market for him
isnt boyle rated higher than a lot of offensive linemen on blocking well worth his salary
definitely solid but garret initially looked inside where boyle had help likely just trying to get eyes in the backfield tbh then ricard popped over with a chip and release across the middle boyle didnt seem to bed the help so big props to him against a huge adversary
wow boyle that is insane a te blocking a top 3 nfl pass rusher like that
boyle is absolutely manhandling garret ricard comes in to chip him but it was barely needed even if garret got off boyle lamar gets the ball out well before garret even touches him
im a lifelong jets fan fully indoctrinated by my father also a lifelong jets fan however i also call myself a pragmatist and have a hard time supporting any organization sport political or enterprise that has no skill in operation

most recently the jets hired adam gase as head coach a man who has done little more in his career than carry water for a veteran peyton manning hed continued to prove he brings no innovation or value to this offense

even before that our owner looks to a nfl network talking head to help him hire a gm because he himself is damn clueless that gave us idzik another example of jets mediocrity

ive watched over the years as the jets have tried to be competent the closest they came was while mimicking the baltimore ravens hiring rex bringing in bart and building up the defense to an actual contender

now i watch the jets and im just pissed at the ineptitude add to that the owner is now in the trump admin sexually harassing people sorry for the hint of politics and i really want little to do with the jets anymore

beyond that i just admire how the ravens are run they know how to draft scout and build a team around its strengths the lamar jackson draft again proves the genius of ozzie i cannot believe mayfield went 1 and jackson fell so far i find myself cheering every time lamar beats the shit out of the browns and hope the ravens continue to destroy them for the foreseeable future i hope cleveland regrets that draft for years to come

a lot is going on in the world right now and i find myself much more impatient to useless worry and stress im also a metsknicks fan thanks again dad so something has to give the jets are becoming a useless worry to me especially after the jamal drama good riddance to him im glad hes not our issue anymore but man do i wish i could follow a team that is all business if gase isnt gone soon the ravens might be that team

ive never considered joining a bandwagon until now i wonder am i a ravens fan does bmore welcome wayward fans from crappy teams like nyj either way i hope lamar gets his first ring this year sam darnold sure as hell isnt
about time the ravens of the north fans start defecting to the mother land
bro youre always welcome here just 3 ground rules

1 steelers clowning is enforced

2 jets are ravens north but worse

3 all opinions are valid except for the trash ones
if you wait long enough half of our squad will end up there anyway but who has time for that fuck the steelers welcome aboard
youre not a ravens fan yet unless you say the 3 magic words
i dont consider it a bandwagon if youre going all in to be a true fan of the team during the good and bad times

fans that came aboard last year but stuck around even after the titans loss not a bandwagon to me

root for an organization you can be proud of with a team that excites you hell id probably be a ravens fan even if i didnt live in baltimore

in short welcome aboard and fuck the steelers
well the jets are just ravens north at this point so you might as well just ease yourself over here
someday this could all be yours
its like when you switch from the store brand knockoff to the name brand youll never go back
come to the black and purple side man we have cookies and lamar jackson
if youre still on the fence do some research on our owner steve biscotti

dude made his fortune off employment companies turns out hiring the best people and knowing how to keep a dedicated and respectful atmosphere is good business for any organization

its the reason weve been considered such a well run organization it all starts with the owner as youve come to realize its amazing how far that effect trickles down i mean the players are well respected enough to basically make their own roster changes ala et3s release

its been a point to draft and recruit people who are enjoyable to be around and having good character its very easy to root for not just the players but the fo as well i absolutely do not blame you for wanting to leave the jets fandom as they have done nothing to earn your continued loyalty they simply pray off indoctrination as you mentioned
hey dont get down you guysbare basically the ravens without success cause you guys sign anyone we dont
as long as you say the magic words to open the doors to flock kingdom youre in no not open sesame but fuck the steelers
hey there fellow jets fan isnt it nice to come here and get a taste of what happiness is like
i only have one question fill in the blank fuck the
i grew up a jets fan for 15 years once they signed favre i knew it was time to jump ship welcome to the flock
welcome to the family
youre basically a ravens fan already with your roster so just change the team name and the color scheme and boom ravens fan
didnt willie snead say something about if you werent on the train already dont hop on now


this is a joke right wheres buck
i mean their analysis is fine but to put them above us what the actual fuck
bruh the steelers did not look that good against the giants the worst team over the last three years they had moments but it wasnt a top five performance
their defense is absolutely elite they will ride that and a good coaching staff to a top 10 finish their offense will struggle and so will ben all that said they are not a better team than the ravens thats just ridiculous
their defense is so nasty that they let the giants drive down the field multiple times and they got lucky with that goal line interception
imagine hating lamar so much you do stupid shit like this in articles that he will never even see just one minuscule example of the kind of shit he has had to deal with
aaron rodgers sure looked washed up how dumb that thinking was came true against the vikings


they slob ok the steelers knob so much its ridiculous i cant wait to fuck them up
this is just a reminder to not believe in any power rankings even if it says were no1
i saw a post in rnfl that said over the past 3 years the giants have had a worse record than the browns and that includes the 016 browns

so if your team is struggling one of the worst team in the past 3 years thats pretty alarming for ya

its honestly because of ben the announcers were praising that man all game even though he played subpar so much bias i cant believe it
who the hell ranked father time ahead of the ravens
whatever opponent adjustments you want to give to the ravens you should give even more to the steelers the giants have one of the worst offensive lines ive ever seen

this must be pete fucking pisscunt
i havent cared about any power ranking since 2011 i care about us playing and winning in january and february
they had an extremely pedestrian offense30th in yards 27th in points last year and were still 88 because their defense kept them in games shoot they still had a chance to reach the playoffs at the end of season if ben stays healthy and thats a big if you have to think they will have a much better offense and when you couple a good offense with that defense they can be dangerous dont sleep on them



with all that being said no fucking way in hell they should be above the ravens
this is like tier 2 clickbait dont fall for it who cares

every site makes rankings and it means fuck all for every team but one in february
i guess we could be division champs for five years in a row and the steelers are still a better team these people are so dumb
didnt we beat them with rg3 when they had a playoff berth riding on it
this is the same company that employs jlcso yeah not super credible
anyone else notice ben constantly grabbing his left knee in that game

power rankings are one half analysis and one half putting what ever popular team is minutely good near the top to generate clicks
the aaron rodgers line and the green bay ranking is all the more insane to me he had one good game after years of not being quite what he used to be and all the sudden theyre the secondbest team this list is awful

having the saints above us is just as insulting their offense looks mediocre and thomas is now out several weeks

edit this is pete prisco who i think is legitimately retarded so maybe we should be nicer he had the packers at 2 going into the season maybe aaron rodgers is legitimately pissed off puts that team on his back and starts playing at an elite level again but they were an overrated team last year and had a bad offseason
the writing is almost as bad as the analysis
ravens were the only team to hold their opponent to single digits and have won 3 consecutive season openers by at least 30 pts an absolute joke
apparently beating the giants beating a division rival and the ravens were arguably the 2nd best team in the nfl last year and look even better but suddenly were not even the best team in our division

what a fucking joke people are so eager for the steelers to be good and the ravens to regress its embarrassing
yeah im a steelers fan and there is no way i put them ahead of baltimore i know they won on the road but youre win was the most impressive of the week imo just doing it to stir shit up
hot take clickbait thats all there is to see here
the only reason i can see for this is fat boy is back in the line up they seem to think ben is a game changer
4d chess someones paying reporters to write up hottake articles and power rankings for bulletin board material
im usually the first to say who gives a fuck about power rankings when i saw this shit i came straightto reddit looking for this thread

what the actual fuck i hate the steelers but respect the actual fuck out of them if they were legitimately a great team i would have no problem with this but in no way in hell are the steelers a top 5 team based on beatingthe giants

does anyone know if theres going to be wired episodes this year
yes they said on social media last night that the first episode would be up tonight
i hope so i think last year they released the episodes every wednesday
tuesday nights at 8pm est i believe
best production crew of any team come see me
there is a teaser up right now for the episode that will come out tomorrow i believe
cant wait to add to my playlist
they had a camp one

i really dont remember seeing any browns fans talking trash on reddit but i could have just missed it i also dont follow sports twitter so that could be where it was happening
as a ravens fan we may actually have to be concerned for the steelers this year

that defense was looking tough also the third wildcard spot should open up some interesting upsets in this years playoffs
3rd and 41 is classic 19452019 browns so its good to see theyre brave enough to continue the trend in 2020
hey thats soon to be 3 time offseason champion browns your talking about
yeah 2020 is bad and all

but imagine being a browns fan
how does baker mayfield not have any muscle tone at all in his arms
lol this was on chris simms monday headline show or whatever its called i like the one the other guy came with bengals bungle burrows beginning
death taxes and the browns sucking
to be fair i think we lost 3 games max and i could see the browns being one of them
so when the browns became the ravensdid the browns fans become ravens fans then leave their old browns team and became fans of new brownsconfusing
i heard from pat mcafee show that the browns are really trying to find a trade for obj lol bye
you really pay heed to those perennial losers
browns fans have been quiet i dont hate them as much this year
the world is burning we are leading the world in coronavirus deaths half the country is completely divided and its mostly over the debate is racism bad

but yeah lets take every possible opportunity to shit on the long suffering fanbase we stole our team from

ravens won who cares


i still think gus deserves more reps hes been consistent for 3 years and gets a lot of chunk yards
well done
literally every time i see dobbins i think hes rice his play style build and number was uncanny on sunday was looking for jamal until i realized this was the current group and not all time rbs
baltimorecore4corps brs rbs 2020

mark ingram ii 21
jk dobbins 27
gus the bus edwards 35
and justice 4 hill 43
some suggestions have all 4 in the same jersey color also dobbins ford patch from his practice jersey looks really out of place i get that pics were limited and that was practically all available until this past weekend

bearing these things in mind id personally prefer them all in white jerseys so each player pops off that beautiful backdrop especially since the only regular season game action for dobbins thus far has come via white tops plus those shots of gus justice are pictureperfect

you could still have them slightly differentiated in that two could be in white jerseysblack pants gus justice from the 2019 regular season bills road game 2019 preseason packers home game respectively whereas ingram dobbins could be wearing the purple pants

granted i suppose the pants portions could be cropped out too of course i found a few photos of those two in said uniform combinations that might work together depending upon what would need done for sizingproportionfitting imagepositioning purposes


mark ingram best i could dig up in this particular uniform combo

mark ingram ii

mark ingram 3

mark ingram 4

mark ingram 5

mark ingram 6

mark ingram 7


jk dobbins

jk dobbins 2

jk dobbins 3

jk dobbins 4


potentially there will be opportunities to wait until after this sunday for some game action snapshots of dobbins sporting the purple top since houston will be wearing all white for their home opener as per usual

on the other hand i wonder if you could somehow photoshop out the ford patch and otherwise just leave everything else the same obviously this is your own creation so whatever your preferences are matter the most above all else

additionally i do love this as is sans that practice patch however i just felt compelled to chime in with some suggestive options that may make this look even more awesome regardless whether you consider any of this thanks for the quality content
the league is not ready

my thoughts are that its going to be much much harder than the browns but that i still expect to win
other than deshaun not one person of their offense scares me
any given sunday but without hopkins i dont see their wrs having any success vs our secondary meaning we can blitz all day which historically watson has struggled with our offence will put up points like it always does it is a good matchup for us
offensively theyre worse across the board than cleveland is except at qb which is a pretty significant step up i expect them to test our defense more but even so i think we have the edge in that matchup

defensively they dont really match up all that well against us jj watt is a good player but hes not 2015 watt anymore their front seven does have good players around him but their dbs should struggle particularly with hollywoods speed theyll need to really harass lamar to protect their back end which was clevelands strategy and it didnt work very well at all

overall theyre a good team but i think we have the edge well see how much their extra prep days help them but on paper we take this one

last year they had the best receiver in the league and a bye week to prepare and got absolutely smoked this year they have a couple extra days to prepare after looking like complete shit front to back after no real offseason 5210
i was scared last year with deandre hopkins not so much this year


i dont see how they score more than 14 points
id like to see how fired up the texans come out playing im sure they havent forgotten last years blowout so im sure they will give us all they have i think if we can get out of the first half with a close game or even a small lead though i think we should comfortably come out in the second half ready to grind out the win
im excited to see us against a better qb watson looked bad week 1 not sure if its the loss of hop or what but last year we dominated their souls i hope to see the same
its gonna be nice having a tougher matchup before the chiefs game
jj watt isnt better then garrett at this point in there respective careers but watt is a matchup nightmare for us because he will challenge our interior line where only bozeman is solid
in my head i keep saying we win by 13 i think thats more than believable
as long as we dont let watson get comfortable we should be ok

considering the ravens are the browns 20 welcome
acting like jumping ship now includes all the years since 95 is funny brush up on the dark days we sat through while you wore brown and orange before posturing like you have tenure

dont see 4th and 41 very often
that was a sweet drive for sure i also really enjoyed the thirty five second td drive before the half after beckham flubbed a third and two pass and the browns missed the field goal ten yards right swinging from a possible 1713 outcome on their last drive to down 246 had to ruin their halftime break
that game had two really great signs

the 99 yard drive you mentioned and the perfectly executed two minute drill for a touchdown only took us 49 seconds i believe

the only criticism i have with sundays game is that lamar should have come out a lot sooner than he did
thats a net 140 yds driven by the entire ravens team offense and defense when you actually think about it i dont believe it has ever happened before or will happen again in the nfl for the defense to back up a team by 41 yds in 3 downs and then for the offense on the very next drive to march down 99 yds for a whopping 140 net yards total in consecutive drives is unimaginably great but when you play the browns great things happen to the ravens just like the 295 yds rushed by jamal lewis all those years ago
to be honest 25 outta those 41 were forced by themselves 3 consecutive flags facemask obj and i believe two false starts you know the browns doing browns things
how those 3rd and 4th downs arent being talked about more is beyond me i am choosing to view it as a sign of things to come
yeah that punt was awesome i figured we were going to have a fruitless drive hopefully getting up the field enough to get a decent punt off but actually scoring there was so awesome



if this actually happens then this will be the second consecutive year in which we beat our week 1 opponent so badly that the player they spent their secondmost recent first round pick on got panic traded
its funny how theyve gone from baker is the future and we have so many weapons to we look so good on paper why cant we get it together
i honesty think this is a ownership issue

after all these qbs coaches etc and you arguably have your best roster in a while you cant figure it out
why is this in the ravens sub
no we dont need him but edc has been very aggressive in the trade market peters campbell hell he even tried to swing a trade for hopkins and clowney lol im expecting edc to keep an eye on the situation
not true but arob is one of the most underrated wrs in the league he would instantly be our wr1
hes just mad because he wants an extension and bears are undervaluing him

if thats the case we aint got the money for his extension
hopkins is big pull he isnt a rando every team should have been on the phone asking about him

peters fell into our lap the rams wanted ramsey

campbell is basically the same fire sale on the jags end why not see what they could get

i dont see picking this guy up when he passed on us before and we want to build up hollywood brown
hes catch the td boykin dropped but aint he due 15m
can he rush the passer
i dont see it he isnt a superstar like earlcalaisclooneyadamspeters he falls into the star category not worth it when we have a potential superstar out of hollywood a ton of young guys whos reps hed be eating into if snead was to go down then yes im all for it but he isnt really worth what we would have to give up to get him
dont need him i like our wrs
stupid ass discussion wed sooner trade for an olb who can edge set than ar12


i can read fast but some of that was absurd
fun fact

lamar only missed one game in college due to injury his freshman year
chiefs fans are actually pretty chill
gif war is next week just crosspost it over there monday
good job just leave the text on the screen a little longer it was hard to read or use fewer words
sorry if its too fast to read i tried my best
why would chiefs fans be salty

bro stop snitchin
yup theyre allowed people have been wearing them for years
hes always worn a little hoodie like that lol
ehhh mask while helmet is off
i think its a cool look like backyard football vibes i just had no idea this was allowed anyone know


its even better because steve harvey is an actual browns fan
i dont think ive ever seen a team go from darkhorse playoff contender to potential 1 pick so fast

and whats crazy is if they win thursday theyll go right back to darkhorse playoff contender
you could post this every year and it would remain relevant
i keep asking people

are the browns that bad or are the ravens that good

i think you guys are that good

but get the brown out of this sub i see it every weekits like a lamborghini dealer shitting on a hyundai


good luck this season

lol with defensive grades like that youd think we were the ones that got blown out
reminder pff grades are actively bashed by a lot of the football analytics community and are extremely subjective they provide information but are imperfect in many other ways for example lamar last year didnt grade out anywhere near where he probably should have no point complaining they arent the same thing as performance just one way to assess play
pff off their wax pens
im going to try to add a little bit of context for these so here we go

jk dobbins also had a grade of 730

bradley bozeman had a pass block grade of 872

matt skura had a pass block grade of 76

miles boykin had a run block grade of 896



malik harrison had a coverage grade of 85 which is amazing

there were a number of players with tackling grades below 30 including marcus peters

i cant really explain why the grades are so low without really looking deep if i mentally go back to the game i remember thinking that the problem with the browns were the same as least year landry was open but baker makes the wrong read baker throws it to obj but he drops the ball baker makes the read and landry is open but then he throws offtarget running game is great but theyre down 20 just a bunch of small different miscues that makes the whole thing seem bad it might just be that the browns offense performed well overall and made our defense grade poorly but those small mistakes led to 6 points in results
lj fort is a god
peters played a good game i thought
i wonder about malik grade i thought he played pretty well
these grades are seriously pulled out of their ass

humphrey allowed 0 tds and forced 1 pbu1 int and a sub 60 passer rating if im not mistaken

i thought tyre also played well in the run blocking i guess they weigh pass protection heavier


how does a rookie who forced a fumble had a sack and a team high 8 tackles get such a poor grade

there were two plays one a toss and one looked like a wheel route where he didnt get the tackle do they weigh that on one person

im surprised they look at our d as poor by dvoa we were top 5 and look to continue the trend of top 510 d

id say our run d prob weighed us down
was on a road trip going to different states highest points including md i made the state one rock higher and i managed to avoid any spoilers for sundays game just watched the condensed version over lunch and hell yeah bois a few mistakes here and there but overall looking good im freakin hyped also pretty happy to be able to open this subreddit too big truzz
im impressed you managed to avoid spoilers


big ben and bathroom stalls
baker mayfield and turnovers
this meme has been true for the last 20 years
bengals and the l is also applicable
lamar and broken ankles

im a simple man i see buck allen i upvote

does anyone remember what happened to him i really liked him as a player but i forget why hes not with the ravens anymore
thank you king
my man
buck allen
wtf just happened my finger naturally upvoted this before my brain could even process what i was looking at

absolute legend

one of my favorite ravens
big if true
rumour has it that buck allens legacy over the position is so strong that it will now henceforth forever be known as running buck
kinda sad that this dude missed out on both 2014 and 2019 perfectly slotted at the start of our only 3 year stretch without a playoff appearance since 9699 and only experiencing a small tease of our future offense never getting more than 5 offensive snaps while lamar was starting in 2018 10 total only 1 in the playoff game

we knew that his star would outshine any and all other ravens but lamar was our future how were we supposed to handle this situation any other way he was simply too good for us it wasnt fair

i thought id check here to post this ask and i might also be asking on photoshop reddit pages too

looking for wholesome memers this past press conference with lamar jackson was cool but what really caught my eye was his all green suit all im asking is for some of you who might also take interest to meme it out for me because tbh i am a caveman i like too laugh too just an open ask and ill throw some coinage on your meme if its a good one looking for most creative memes big truss at the bank

heres a link to his presser lamar jackson green suit 913

idk it could be fun but an open invite to spice up this page with wholesome memes of our beast of a qb while we await a houstons destruction next sunday
even better

use his shirt as your canvas
i see everyone on this sub praising the defense and taking about how we dominated the browns but i havent seen anyone mention the fact that hunt average 55 ypc and chubb had 60 ypc sure defense played a great game held the browns to 6 but there were still a lot of big gash runs and its mildly concerning to me
i am not concerned because it is week one
week four was pretty pathetic last season but we turned out okay
in a manner of speaking it is pre season
when you jump out to a big lead like that you kind of concede the run and focus on not giving up anything deep however there is still work to be done on that front im not worried though 2 rookie starting ilbs and 3 new guys on the dline rotation including 2 starters theyll get it figured out
when yards start to translate to points ill be concerned its a bend but dont break sort of thing i mean we put up 500 yards of offense against the titans and only scored 12 points points wins games
it was a porous run defense but keep in mind its week 1 and chubb and hunt are great backs david johnson had one pretty good game but i dont expect him to be on that level so the worry is lessened
gotta give queen and harrison a bit of time to acclimate before judging too harshly
outside runs look to be the problem hopefully they get it corrected
queen got held up on blocks frequently has a lot of growing to do but he has special speed
take out each rbs longest carry and shortest and you have

chubb 8 carries for 32 yards 40 ypc

hunt 11 carries for 50 yards 45 ypc

those are much more realistic numbers and show how stout the ravens rush defense actually was we are not going to prevent every single big play and that can skew averages but look at what we let up on an average play and it is a far better indication of what we did

we only let up 4 runs of 10 yards or more out of 27 attempts the average carry length before first contact was 21 our run defense was dominant we just played 2 of the top 10 rbs in the league at the same time
hunt was also used out wide a lot which you really arent going to stop kareem hunt from being effective out wide unless you create a well disguised blitz from the safetys hes been doing it his whole career and honestly ill take that from chubb getting one big 30 yard run all game instead of the 84 yards to the house this defense is pretty new together with no pre season its not gonna be 2000 off the rip
its somewhat part of the heavy blitzing scheme when you have 5 or 6 guys pinning their ears back constantly youre taking the risk of getting gashed in the run game
if the pass d keeps playing the way it has been im fine giving up 5 ypc
its concerning to me too because its in large part what caused the loss in the playoffs last year however two things to consider 1 its week one so there is time to make improvements and 2 even if the defense plays the way it did last year its only going to cause a problem if the offense isnt hitting on all cylinders
its week one is they had two very fast and talented runners we held them to 6 points force a fumble on a rushing attempt

i dont know what more you want they didnt let them run it up our assholes all day could have been worse
i just chalk it up to the first game and the d still putting it together and being rusty remember too that chubb and hunt are two of the very best rb tandems in the league

and before anyone shits on pff ken mckusick and sarah ellison agree
wonder if fluker moving over to tackle mid game had anything to do with it
best left tackle in football went down guy who plays mostly guard stepped in at tackle rookie right guard and another guy coming off a major knee injury oh we also played a very good dline

if that was the worst that they are going to play and given the circumstances it very well may be the worst they could play i will be more than happy with it

they will get better and they will be fine
cleveland has arguably the best d line in the league though
i was saying this during the game the browns d line won as hard as ive ever seen a d line win they were in the backfield every play and were slowing our potent run offense all the ravens had to do was run scramble drills the browns just couldnt catch lamar even with penetration every play and lamar was finding his receivers on the run

people look at lamars numbers and go wow look what he did from the pocket nah he did that shit on the run the whole game and still posted the highest efficiency of the week the dude literally transcends the game there is nothing the browns could have done to stop it i mean it might be the most ridiculous performance ive ever seen from lamar individually because ive never seen him under that much pressure
and we still won 386 this team is already scary good but still has a lot of room to improve i believe they will dont overreact we didnt have a oreseason give these guys a few weeks to gel and get better as a unit the ravens are the team in the nfl with the highest ceiling
its going to take time to move on from yanda
looking forward to seeing how they deal with watt next week
idk i rewatched the game and did not see glaring oline issues shit happens but on big plays lamar had time to throw and thats how we scored
not too big of a deal imo the fact that tp is a rookie skura literally destroyed his knee 10 months ago and fluker was just signed a few months ago gives me hope theyll improve just as long as they dont end up on that list by november everything will be okay
correa making an appearance on that list too cant believe he found another team and is getting any playing time time and time again showing how hes not a nfl caliber player
im pretty much done with pff not saying that we were great but im not sold on their ratings meaning anything anymore

too handsome would break the servers
justin i still fucking got it tucker
ha you expect lazy ass ea to give a shit 8 years in the league arguably the best kicker in that time span still no picture
they want 60 bucks for the game and cant even pay to use a kickers likeness
hes the executioner it fits plus you can always watch those whack rofo commercials for your jt fix
the current generation of games cant render a god be glad they at least gave him a human form
if his pic wasnt in the last one no way to copypaste it into this one
it is a family game and he is nsfw
i am so glad i havent spent 60 on madden ever and havent played one in years god ea is trash how do you expect people to pay 60 yet you dont even have a picture for the best kicker in the league
concerningly small amount of truzz
i actually only play 2k with the updated rosters
is madden any good
they need to bring the game period

im actually surprised nigel warrior eli wolf and will holden arent protected holden might make a little sense with fulker playing swing tackle
we must really really like this long snapper
huntley needs to be on the roster and mcsorely on the ps

theres basically bots that make these headlines and post the videos for views if you watch both videos youll see theyre the same
hey if you place a bet on every horse in the race you cant lose
so i was just messing around this morning and happened to look at the list of ravens all time pro bowlers turns out there are only two positions that the ravens havent had someone make the pro bowl in


the ravens have never had a player make it in as a receiver or as a center im not counting jermaine lewis or jacoby jones who were wrs but made it in as returners im also not counting morgan cox who made it as a long snapper heres to hoping that changes this year with hollywood and skura

edit ravens had zuttah make it as a center in 2016 so looks like receiver is the only position left
i thought jeremy zuttah made it in 2015 or 2016
weve had receivers that should have made the probowl mason had over 100 catches a few years ago
hollywood 2021
very surprised matt birk didnt make the probowl in his 4 years here
i thought sss made it

just heard the clean version of this song last night wet and gushy
wjames a proche
incredible lmaoo

someone is going to ask where this is from so it might as well be me

the only way i can even tie together llamas meditation and social distancing is because of zen god lamar ensuring no defender even comes within 6 feet of him

im with you i love this fanbase decades of success yea it hasnt always been pretty and weve had some tough playoff losses we could really have 4 super bowl wins with some of the squads weve had i like watson but hes no lamar and i dont see him putting up 30 to beat us
love you too hunni


its the same thing we did last week it is for special teams coverage while moore is hurt

i met elvis dumerville once at the giant in pikesville he was incredibly nice but i still felt bad about disturbing his grocery shopping
i keep going backandforth in my head how tomorrow will go

most of me thinks this is just another opponent in the way and will a be a breeze just as last years 417 drubbing went easy win no questions on to kc

then my pessimistic side is like deshaun watson just got paid and is tired of playing second fiddle to mahomes and lamar in the eyes of the league

but bill obrien actively makes them bad i know the fact hes still their hc and gm is mind boggling but i digress an embarrassment on during the first game of the year on national television tack on a 10day break first home game with fans mind you and a relatively healthy team has me thinking tomorrow could be a trap game

we have kc on sunday night next week the only team that routinely has had our number during this past run im not saying were looking forward but if you said some guys were no part of me would be surprised hell im making plans already for next weekend

someone calm my nerves thanks truzz
well we should win but this is the nfl you never know until the game is over or at the very least the end of the 3rd quarter when lamar gets pulled again
im nervous but thats me every week as the saying goes any given sunday
isnt the chiefs ravens game on monday night next week
you know whats one of the best things about being a fan

other than some emotional investment or the illadvised sports bet with large amounts of actual money on the line the outcome of the game has little to no impact in the grand sheme of things for us as fans

sure maybe a small heartbreak here or there happens when the team loses an important game but we also get high highs a fun ride when things are going good right now my friend things are going great so to keep it short simple

just enjoy the fireworks
haha i wish that ravens kc game could be played with fans

although tin the grand scheme of things its rly not important haha but weve played them twice now in kc
id love to see the outcome in front of our crew and home field advantage
ravens roll houston doesnt have enough on offense to really challenge the ravens defense our ground game should pick back up this week and itll be a 3 score blow out
the ravens will win or houston will run all over us control the clock get some key stops and get an unlikely victory hopefully the first one
believe me im all for routes but i think one of the issues that we saw in the playoffs last year was that we blew so many people out in the regular season we didnt really know how to play from behind

obviously we win and lamar stunts all over them hoes just hoping the texans can offer some competition
we gonna stunt
were in great position rn on paper the browns have a great team yes they are the browns but they got the offense to give any defense trouble and we routed them next 2 games we atleast need to go 21 and well be in amazing shape after that we got 3 gimmies was cin phil im sure we can go 30 during that stretch playing clevelands offense then playing watson and mahomes back to back weeks would probably be any teams nightmares to start a season worst case scenario is we go 12 in these next 2 weeks
after seeing how lamar has handled himself since entering the league and his and hollywoods comments about sleeping on the titans i dont think trap games are gonna be a thing for this team at least for this year its gonna be a blood bath
i think itll be tougher than we expect hou does not want to be 02
i try to never get cocky just on principle ive only been cocky once in the past 10 yearslast years titans game

these posts are so fucking lame

harlan and trent green of course they gave the chiefs game to romo lol
i cant believe pats dolphins got romo last week

even more importantly tytus howard is questionable hes bad so whoever his backup is will be nothing short of awful
wtf happened to duke johnson dude is seriously made out of glass been injured like 75 of his career
this game is going to make the browns look good
texans rb duke johnson listed as questionable with an ankle injury is unlikely to play vs ravens per source texans signed rb cj prosise off their practice squad

texans wr brandin cooks listed as questionable for today with a quad injury is expected to play per source

that would be big im not worried if not though because lamar is 203 when playing football during the regular season
howard was fucking awful week one but that means the backup is even worse id expect a ton of blitzes at watson
how many of those wins was dhop a factor
watson has only been sacked less than 3 times in 12 games thats unbelievably bad
were gonna bully tunsil too
could be a factor but howard was horrendous in week 1
damn his sack numbers are crazy he holds the ball way too long

why doesnt watt have a game status doesnt look like a vet day if its a hip thing
holy shit i cant believe football is back and its amazing
im sad because i have to work tomorrow during the game im happy because no matter what next monday ill get to catch most of the game of what i consider to be the game of the year
i am moving to maryland next week so i get to have a new nfl team sorry falcons but you let me down too much go birds falcons will always be my 1 but lfg ravens
as an aussie member of the flock shhh im trying to sleep so i can get up in time for the game at 6am monday morning
all the 1pm games look awful i dont really wanna watch any of them other than maybe rams eagles
no its not its 1 am stop posting these earlier and earlier for karma
it has been for quite some time here in australia
not yet its 1045 in california
lets goooooo
bruh ive been up gotta hit the water for crabs
set my alarm for 615am im fucking ready
if we play our game houston doesnt have a chance
watching canesvscards the ravens need to get bubba bolden ed reed is coaching him up for us also i like tutu atwell and brevin jordan
i havent even gone to bed yet im so excited i dont have to wake early for a 10am pst kickoff for once
all the dogs in tha house
plan for today 1 prepare to watch football 2 watch football 3 watch more football ravens football 4 watch yet more football and enjoy the ravens victory
oh lawd where i am its not game day yet and youve made me realise i need to go to bed so im not messed up when i wake up at 3am for it
night yall
i work nights so im pumped we got a little later start time ill be waking up right as kickoff hits
anyone know how i can legally streampay for the game from a different state
time to stunt on some hoes
these hoes will be thoroughly stunted on
happy about stanley and jimmy playing
lets go 3113 final
meh its a 4 oclock game gonna nap some more


then its mf gameday
damn game isnt until 4 just figured that out buzz killed
where are the nfl live streams
gotta start fast score early and often and hopefully just kill clock and wear them down

i am a little scared because this is a textbook look ahead spot on the road with the chiefs coming to town next monday night




its hard to argue with he deserves it hes much better than tunsil

but also fuck
stanleys deal is a forgone conclusion at this point besides lamar the most important guy on the team is the one who protects his blindside pay that man his money
we can and will do it if the chiefs and the rams can afford to pay all their players so will we itll be even easier with earl gone too
he deserves it and i have faith in big dick decosta to figure out a way to give it to him
how can every position keep getting paid more and more te cb qb among others at some point the market has to stop getting reset
its frustratingi think we made a mistake not getting his deal done before tunsil maybe stanley wasnt willing to negotiate until tunsils deal got done but it feels like weve painted ourselves in a corner now
i know were in good shape next year for the salary cap but damn were still going to have a hard time paying everyone
give him on of those 10 year contracts with a lot garuanteed maybe hell take a discount lol

but seriously his cap hit is already like 13 mil an extra 10 wont hurt too much hopefully hes not trying to be greedy
well deserved

pay that man


oh my

just shot you a pm

where to cop
woot wooooooot
i need this shirt lmao
here yall go they have them in all colors


such a classy shirt do they ship to the netherlands hahaha
is it unpopular to believe deshaun watson does not belong in the same group as mahomes wilson and lamar i think hes an athletic and unique talent but i dont think hes transcendent like the other three his praise and glory reminds me of matt ryans in his prime treated as golden when hes silver at best and when he doesnt succeed its always because of everything around him meanwhile lamar has to prove himself weekly and does maybe its me
think you meant wilson and not watson in that first sentence but yes i agree he looked pretty just okay in the opener great athlete no doubt but not a great quarterback yet but his o line has never been good for him
yea it definitely isnt unpopular i think most would agree watson is a step below mahomeswilsonlamar
hes great when he has an all star cast around him but its becoming clear that without top tier players his offense is not that good feel like lamar could step in there and just take over and still make plays in all facets on offense
it was interesting to see that according to mike sandos qb tier list nfl coaches and executives still rate watson over jackson

it seems like watsons issues get excused by his subpar coaching and team while jacksons accomplishments get excused by good coaching and his athletic talents

for the record i like watson but lamar is clearly ahead of him
i think hes good but not great i also think he has boneheads for coaches and a fo that isnt doing him any favors by trading away one of the best wrs in the nfl in his prime for an injury prone rb who has seen his best years behind him
we still havent seen what watson does in a season without hopkins who is probably the best wr in the league i think he is being overrated by many and you need to consider his lone playoff win to be a fluke since josh allen basically gifted them the game but of course the agenda will be bill obrien is the one holding him back when he will play bad
i think watson is limited by his team and coaching not as good as lamar and mahomes but i bet if hes in reids offense he would be in the same tier
i dont think its unpopular here and maybe mixed with other subs hes a good qb dont get me wrong but i agree i wouldnt put him anywhere near mahomes wilson or jackson

i think this year without hopkins will really tell how good he really is
i agree it doesnt make a lot of sense to me he is clearly talented but he hasnt been able to put it together on a consistent basis the way the others in the group you listed have i dont understand the love and money he has gotten
tbf to him i think he was totally unprotected behind that line last year plus his hc is awful
ive been a fan of watson since he was at clemson and believe he could be maybe just below lamar and mahomes if he was in a different situation lamar and mahomes have taken their teams to a new level and deshaun hasnt but he does have by far and fucking away the worst coach and front office of the 3
i think hes good but not great he couldve been much better by now if he had a better coaching and weapons around him he probably couldve been as hot as lamar in a system thats more designed around him but im not sure houston has the brain trust to figure that out
i think its about to become more and more popular i dont think hes as good and hes always had stacked talent now his boy hopkins is gone
watson does deserve to be in that group
i dont think hes put into those conversations because of talent

i think hes there for the most part because along with lamar and patty hes part of the next generation of qbs

drew brees to their brady v manning if you will not the best example but i do think hell have some success
absolutely disagree watson is amazing the texans have allowed so many qb hits and sacks in the past 3 years i think even the best of qbs would struggle behind it
this isnt unpopular i dont think

whats unpopular is taking it a step further and saying that he doesnt even belong in that next tier and without hopkins he doesnt really offer much than slightly above average play

obviously thats yet to be proven but its been my thought since his rookie year he has gotten bailed out on so many bad throws by hopkins until i see him do it without hopkins i cant in good conscience rank him above or in line with the likes of rodgers brees brady tannehill dak or whoever else you may put on that next tier down after the top 3
i like watson and think he is a great qb on that level very talented and often creates something from nothing hard to succeed with a bad oline and bob even with those obstacles they shouldve beat kc last year in the playoffs completely choked that game away i feel bad for him if anything how do you give hopkins away for peanuts and then spend that money on cooks and johnson just abysmal fo decisions
i blame it on bob
yes its unpopular because its wrong and a dumb opinion
he reminds me a lot of earlycareer andrew luck people would act like hes the new face of the league but hes only betterthanaverage

watson has a ton of potential but potential doesnt make you elite

i dig it
post this to some of the nfl meme subs and itll do well good work
the circle of life
this is incredible
great work im sorry the talents of your quarterback and your fan base are being squandered by the bob era my friend wish you better days ahead
this is great we can only hope it will be this easy
all memes aside what subject is this anthropology and human origins is a topic that ive always been interested in
what the hell is this format its dank af
jeez guys thats ruthless a

as a seahawks fan im getting a little triggered watching yall collapse that pocket on watson over and over
a thing of beauty



quality content
dark and macabre but i like it

i would put ingram at rb2 and start snead at flex for the best chance of winning
rip bye week
lmao uoure 10
hokie flock baby
fuck the haters this rules
hey another tech fan too love it
no offense but that fantasy team is terrible
u winning today
the sad part is this is actually better than a lot of yall haters teams
wait so whod you take in the first round then cause hopefully it wasnt lamar lmao
i thought i was too much of a homer with jackson tucker and our d
guess youre conceding the bye week
terrible lineup
i will clap and maybe even say yes if they do so

i want mark andrews to score a touchdown
clap do you mean applause n approval or praise expressed by clapping
i believe lord baltimores ravens will win the american football game against sam houstons texans
clap clap
i concur

im too used to ravens past i was waiting for a loss every game of the 12 game win streak
nah this team is driven they arent gonna be listening to any talking heads on tv
yes but im superstitious and weak
im still nervous for every game tbh the anxiety keeps me humble
nah i think im done being nervous in the regular season we finally have a team capable of carrying the load on both sides if the defense sucks lamar can easily hang 30 on this team if the offense is stalling i can see the defense containing watson

the annoying part is we could win this game 2717 and analysts would start asking are the ravens starting to slip lol
no in the short run any nfl team is dangerous the games are notoriously flukey and everything could come together either against us or for us but in the long run the ravens are a championshipquality team
its always good to be a little nervous about teams like the texans teams that arent flat out bad and that have the capability to surprise you like they have talent and that talent can show up for any given game but the coaches cant make it gel from week to week

that being said i think our d is gonna feast on that oline
could be a close game or could be a shutout
some analysts are predicting this to be close stephen a and mike vick even called for the texans to win
im always nervous no matter how good we looked last week i have ptsd from the boller days and flaccos inconsistency days
hell no im predicting that too cuz its happening

107 both lines lookn suspect for the ravens so far
im nervous because ofc i want this team to win but i also dont want watson and watt to start off 02 deshaun is amazing i just dont know why he had to face two of the best teams in the league in back to back weeks

i just want a close game regardless who wins

you do realize the monstars lose right

i like this
i have an obligation today so i cant watch live so i want to attempt to not look at my phone or any other news until a few hours later and hopefully find a source of a recorded broadcast any ideas where online might have the game im out of market fwiw
get a trial of youtube tv and record it
google nflfullhd up same night if not day after
edit i watched last game 5 hours after kick off on this site
lamar jackson
you mean the corner cut from the jets this is a ravens sub lol
lamar fast go vroom

i thought i could hit him i tried to blindside ray he ran me over
ochocinco telling the story of getting absolutely laid out by ray lewis from a different game week 5 of 2009 is still one of the funniest things ive ever seen i almost couldnt find a link online anymore but thankfully i had shared it in an email in 2012 and it still works

the hit

the explanation
ray said take a seat
chad was great
very funny

i am sticking with dj fluker
living in galveston my 1st chance to see the llama mvp in person and i cant
my wife and i were going to fly down for this one
true but at least you get to live in galveston

someone had to make it obviously we are all bronco fans today who else are you rooting for i personally hope la destroys the eagles
lets just all get into a prayer circle and hope every raven makes it out healthy cause the nfl reaper has already gotten solomon thomasnick bosajimmy g drew lock and saquon so far
steelers looking like against the fairly anemic broncos defense
take my all of my energy denver
the nfc east is looking like absolute trash to start the season good news for us
bosa out

that sucks
im starting to get very scared with all these injuries happening
the broncos are awful badly coached horrible qbs best player out injured
lets go hurst
the rams are legit this year
fuck the steelers
good to see hayden hurst get a td
dallas lol
nfc east making every team in the league a championship contender team lol
broncos some straight ass
mark andrews has the same amount of tds as the new york jets this season
steelers choking
gojags sure why not go jaguars
so many injuries so far
daniel jones looks bad this giants bears game is producing some ugly injuries saquon out montgomery fell on his neck
fuckkk not bershad perriman too
absolutely horrendous everybodys hurt right now
having backup good qb is absolutely something every team needs feels so bad for denver
wow dalton is in for dallas

dak is back

are pringles a sponsor
for ravens fans who want to chat with other homers about our rivals game while waiting for our game
ive seen better hands on a clock

thats a good line
steelers barely win against broncos practice squad bodes well
lol wtf is this offense run the ball on 2nd and 23 and still lose yards then a checkdown on 3rd and 25 i thought these guys were supposed to be better off without the elite dragon
lock got blasted yikes
did anyone else hear that

wtf was that
yeah im switching to the lions packers game drew lock is out juedy got speared this game is done
what a joke of a penalty
steelers return guy is dangerous
23 single handedly losing this game for the broncos

good boy no bad boy
our boy hayden hurst just scored his first touchdown as part of the falcons im proud
he making my fantasy team scary
hey there fellow atlanta ravens fan
so happy for hayden i really liked him almost bought his jersey well those new atl jerseys are pretty tight so maybe ill pick one of those up

jim rome said that kyler murray is a more explosive runner than lamar


people are crazy
kyler is a great runner should probably run more often but the stratosphere that lamar is in running the ball is different kyler is lightning lamar is a fucking nuke running the ball just fucks everything up your eyes ankles soul etc
i didnt know jim rome was still alive
its jim rome dudes a clown
what the hell is wrong with people
well his runs are more explosive but thats because his runs are almost exclusively scrambles these will inherently be bigger than designed runs

however lamar is still more explosive but i can see why someone would say that about murrays running
now lamar isnt running enough you say
he just seems more explosive because he has shorter legs and therefore sorter strides makes him look super fast

lamar with his longer strides just looks like hes almost coasting as hes running ie look at randy moss
this season sure overall no way in hell lamar hasnt really gotten it going yet on the ground but i think thats mostly by design teams are terrified of him gashing them for big gains so its been a huge part of their game plan but this offseason he focused on getting better at passing so he doesnt always have to do that and so far its paying off
i guess by some measures he arguably might be i feel like he can hit zero to sixty in a straight line a little quicker maybe but hes nowhere near as elusive and doesnt have the same change of direction as lamar does
maybe but lamars vision and elusiveness is the best a qbs ever had
even if true it only means they are both explosive af
everyone just flocks to the new shiny thing

theyre both awesome but murray isnt the open field runner that lamar is
if you compared him to last year lamar than youre absolutely right something about this year tho granted only 2 games where he just hasnt been running at the same level as last year
rome is a very excitable dude
explosive runner lamar wins

explosive offense sorry guys but kyler has insane receiving weapons and a pretty good rb too
seems like the lack of preseason gamescontact may be catching up to some teams with the insane amount of injuries today hope everyone on both teams both sides of the ball can come out of todays game fully healthy
dont go on rnfl today yall its looking like an obituary page in a newspaper
shoot tavon young is injured you jinxed us
you jinxed us
amen to that lots of casualties around the league so far today no more
rip tavon hype
lets us pray yall
yeahhh id rather lose than win but take as many injuries as the niners have today that would be essentially if we lost lamar dobbins and judon in one half
bless the knees
aged poorly

he is about as wide open as my relationship status jeebus
he played really good well at least until that onside kick
i cheered so hard
its only been two games but hes really breaking out this year good for him

and in the immortal words of bart scott

this steelers game is boring af

those kicks are clean might have to cop me a pair
this assures victory
i copped those kicks when they dropped a couple months ago specifically for sundays at the bank theyre cleaner w white laces
fucking love the jords wish i could get me a pair

i bought my black lj jersey just in time for last years game vs the seahawksweve only had one loss when i wore that on game day

i got a color rush one now so im passing on the luck of the black jersey to you
love those kicks too

yoooo that is siick
where did you get those shoes my dude

sick kicks

dumpster fire
lol why am i not suprised
its ravens gameday and were still talking about the browns smh

someone needs to tell advertisers its honestly ok to have a football commercial without baker in it
texans we need a stop to get deshaun the ball back



haha big truzz go weeeeeeee
someone gets ejected and no one considers showing a replay
please change the game clock to 4 seconds because a player thrashed around like a 5 year old
we need some typa marlon play rn a pick or a forced fumble something man d needs to wake up
i havent seen the ravens make an interception like that since ed reed
again earl who
wait you can have a first possession without a td
thank god we have so many doctors in this thread
tavon young is the michael campanaro of cornerbacks
lamar looks mad hes gonna scorch these guys
what the fuck is this western cat commercial lmao
matt almost judon
this team was going to play us hard from the start were in their house and we embarrassed them in ours last year i still feel good about our chances but we cant give up big plays like the cooks catch
i swear judon busts through the line like a madman once every ten plays and then just totally whiffs
what the hell the refs literally giving the texans time
you guys are ridiculous that was a bs penalty on averrett the refs gifted them that drive
what happened to will fuller

marlon fuckin humphrey is what happened
gotta admit last year spoiled us up 13 on the road against a playoff team and were griping

still feels like this team should be playing better
big bois

little bois
line is low key horrible today if we had flacco he would have been sacked four times that drive and it wouldnt have even been his fault
bal 20
hou 7
refs 3
queen just jumping ontop the dog pile lol
this is a road game ugly win is a good win
it feels weird being up 17 and still not feeling totally satisfied this team is so good
i feel like we just sleepwalked into 30 points
woke up at 3am for this game totally worth it
off topic but good god

andy slaterandyslater news to report patriots rb james whites father was in a car crash today and did not survive his mother wasalso in the car and is in critical condition whites father tyrone was a captain with the miamidade police department james was told and is inactive tonight
i know im spoiled when they score over 30 and i still feel the performance was middling
have a great day from down under ravens flock

enjoy the win and sleep well

big fucking truss boys
im really happy about that td but i this tavon young injury really killed the mood for me
what a freakin int dude can you guys believe the rams traded that man to us how fucking stupid
the lj stands for lamar jackson fort
judon needs to step up if he wants to get paid
kung fu ingram is my favorite ingram
no one deserves it more than ingram an unselfish player who has been the heart of this team
ok deshon elliot has arrived
anybody want to clue me in on what he did

looking at u announcers
discussion about last years playoff game

and i was having such a great time
yanda youre gonna have to start eating again my dawg
why arent they replacing averett with jimmy smith
im the joker baybeeee
ravens all right were done

jk lol
refs must be on draftkings
that shot of watson on the sideline
sam koch has the easiest job in the nfl
the texans fucked up doing that their defense was playing well and now they just gave us momentum and good field position
how the fuck do the refs add 3 seconds on the clock with no flag and no time out what the fuck
administrative failure lololol
will someone please block for fucking lamar
justin reid just caused us a missed highlight forever
we scored 33 and you can tell lamar is gonna be hard on himself
prayers that tavon doesnt have a serious injury
lamar bout to go off after not liking the ending to that drive
the o line looks like shit

signed ravens fan since 96
i love tucker but i hate field goals
where the hell is jk dobbins
calais campbell is built like all of my rpg characters
the texans are a lucky bunch being forced to play the chiefs and ravens backtoback
what happened to their main target hes getting locked up by some all pros on defense
queen just jumping on top of the pile lol
lmaoo that split second when peters was confused what to do with the int
run and pass blocking have been shit both games so far very concerning
we missing yanda big time
do we have any more 5th round picks to trade for a nickle corner
missing tavon already
anyone see queen just yeet his way on top of the pile
i get that we all want the game in hand but overall its been a well played game against a playoff team

were not just gonna dick down every team we play
when he started kicking the texans logo
its hilarious how a couple of years ago i wouldve been stoked on scoring 33 pts but today i feel like our offense was a little off haha
3316 blowout and the ravens couldve played even better
im glad kc won because i dont see mahomes losing twice
still fucking got it
quick someone feed yanda before we get the ball back
touchdown on this drive ends the game
offensive line you son of a bitch im in
you friccin morons you just got grammed
hey i dont know about you guys but im rooting for the ravens
gif request mark ingram punching then round housing the texans logo in the back of the end zone
are we all watching this cat commercial i can never unsee that
that pass to brown was the first one ive seen jackson actually miss all year
oh my god that is one of the best interceptions ive ever seen
daily reminder we turned a kicker and kenny young into marcus peters
i didnt see anything on averett weak call imo
that was such a stupid penalty on averret doesnt even make sense stills ran into him
ravens not up by 30 at the half we must be gunning for that 1 pick next year
houston isnt as bad as the week 1 game would make you believe
chiefs are loosing to the chargers

lets gooo
harbs saw hollywood spamming the wildcat on madden
big trusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
and they said ingram is washed
no little boy
alright boys lets not get cute with it lets run it down their goddamn throats
throbbin for dobbins
that looked very 27ish
the line actually looks horribe rn thank god for lamar tho
positives controlling the top

negatives the oline needs to do better lamar shouldnt have to scramble this much
7 pass attempts 5 rush attempts for lamar 1 rushing attempt by the runningbacks combined
its not fun ending a drive with tucker but its damned good knowing hes there
can we talk about the fucking swagger of don wink mullet big belly sleeveless shirts hes basically a cooler version of everybodys dad
dumb dumb call by texans to go for it on 4th
funny a tiktok ad on the day that tiktok is being pulled in the us
still want to say judon is just not worth the price we need real pass rush
bruh hollywood looking like an alien with that big ass helmet thats our guy
tuckers gotta be in on a fake fg someday koch to tucker for a td cmon harbaugh
man lamar had green infront of him
take your credit dude who called the marlon punch
it doesnt matter which lj it is they all score tds
how is marlon humphrey just so good when it comes to ripping the football out of the opponents hands its a form of artwork at this point
lets get a mp pick or elliott pick here
thank you vedvik for marcus peters
this sub

texans score we are trash we blow we need this we need that

defense steps up omg we are thr best i love this defense we are the best ever since the 2000 defense omg omg omg

ive missed you all
weak penalty
yoooo this is sus from the refs lol
administrative failure my ass
so wait they just give you extra time if you complain

what is this brady era new england
that shit on averett is illegal contact but that isnt a penalty defending andrews
woof wide open 30 yards downfield lucky watson missed
get averett out of the fucking game
biden what is your plan if young is out for significant time
dont know if its the doordash sushi or not but i have a funny feeling in my gut
the roundhouse kick is epic
thats a big boy run
hahahaha fuck you earl
its ok watson well all be your fans next week
mom can we get ed reed 20

mom we have ed reed 20 at home

ed reed at home reid 21 houston texans
since im watching from holland im going to bed happy very very happy no big injuries hope young is okay another w all good here
i see you chuckc36 way to lead them king proud of my guys tonyjefferson
excuse me im the most happy that were in the lamar era but can we cool it with the joe flacco slander in this thread

some of us were actually fans before 2019 lol
lmaoooo our fan base is so spoiled
its crazy how lamar was absolutely surrounded by defenders yet looked completely calm
wanted 7 but ill take the 3
we are doing alright but whats with the lack of rb runs
oline looking like hot garbage so far
pat ricard has twice as many career touchdown catches as nick boyle poor poor nick boyle ryanmink
the inability to get consistent pressure on the qb is really becoming a liability
man we need to start making some of those sacks great catch by fells on fairly good coverage by levine
lamar had plenty of space in front of him
fruit punch
fruit punch
thats a td baby lets go
pay marlon yesterday lol what a play from our all pro cb
that was one of the nastiest ints ive ever seen
marcus marcus peters peters
every play is a fucking highlight reel what a pick by peters rams fans are sooooo dumb for saying he wasnt good
that was one of the best interceptions ive ever seen
oline is a big concern and stanley is hurt again shit
losing yanda is already looking huge for us
bullshit penalty then stopping the clock and adding time what the fuck is this officiating
that gets called pi 99 of the time
bro wtf is ray doing in that picture
avarett is straight up trash and they know it
after two weeks im not mad we didnt drop bank on judon
yall act like nobody is ever going to get a completion against us
hey fuck pittsburgh amirite
td along with a roundhouse that would make chuck norris proud
i am so fucking gay for mark ingram iii idgaf what anyone says
you just lost to mark ingram at qb
also what a block by mekari

big brain move from harbaugh

if you lose the challenge you lose the timeout you probably wouldve used anyway to regroup before basically a gamedeciding call
the time the ref will be under the hood will almost certainly be more time than a normal timeout
you can luck out and pick up the first
did yall see what happened i didnt see a replay
i definitely feel like lamar was grumpy today
kinda wish wed let lamar get a td there somehow
dobbins said fuck yo defence
i like the call to hollywood but maybe they could have disguised it better regardless nice tackle by the texans defender
lamar got us 3 points there evaded like 4 sacks
ok guys time to put rgiii in
foh with these tik tok commercials
lamar said
lamar looked bored af on the bench
lamar in a commercial
fun fact lamar is 910 right now
theyre just targeting anthony levine since the tavon young injury
deshon elliot is a work in progress right now
okay now get some defense i want a turnover
good lord tuckers kick couldnt have been more on center
thats a touchdown
who called for the marlo play lol
im sorry 15 straight games with a takeaway is this even legal
peters is an absolute fucking chad
deshaun looked like he wanted to break that surface lol
this fucking interior o line is hot garbage
refs gifting the texans 3 points is pathetic
nice drive refs
what fucking garbage refs spotting the texans up the field there and even giving them time to get a fg
i think we downplayed the loss of yanda
the oline is booboo tiddy fuck today
pitkc going to feast on our oline if we dont get it worked out
brown is straight up getting over powered at the los he gets knocked back 23 yards instantly
yall acting like obj is not playing against jj fucking watt
averett looking like chykie brown
lj jumped on the pile

8 minute drive needed here
whats it like to root for a good team

sad nyj fan
yes the truss is still enormous
at first i thought it was lamar that took it then i was like why is he not running way faster lmao
big trusssssssss
thats my runningback
mi2 going fucking mauy thai on the logo is the funniest shit i have seen today lmao
earl who
i love this team
i just want a lamar bomb to the endzone and im good
cbs show some god damn replays what the fuck
grumpy lamar gonna stunt next week
tuck is definately happy today
shoutout to jimmy smith for not hearing his name at all today
i dont deserve this what did i do in my life to deserve being this happy every sunday
jk has such a bright future
i like dobbins i just think hes neat
dobbins is fucking legit
that dobbins run is gonna make it look like we curbstomped the texans with the run game today when thats not exactly the story lol
its funny to see players on the other team surrounding lamar after the game they are such big fans of him
man fuck all these injuries today wtf
slay kweeeeeen slayyyyyyyy
tough time for his first bad throw i think he had the td
the sound of the ball being kicked in an empty stadium is so satisfying
lamar has to take the space and get the easy first down i know going for tds is nice but on 3rd you gotta secure the first
3 man rush lamar should have scrambled that time
marlon the most underrated defensive player in the game no one even acknowledges it
it looks like lj got in
marlo and punching the ball out name a more iconic duo
marlons new sponsorship deal
not the lj who i thought would score today but ill take it
fort isnt a hofer and he may not be on the ravens all that long but fuck if hes not a great story and an awesome pickup love that guy
lj lj sb lv
somewhere ed reed is smiling
yeah marlo and marcus are going allpro again
i love mp juiceman
marshall yanda if youre listening if jesus can come back from the dead you can come back to play in the nfl marshall pls
refs are babying texans
holy fuck theyre really trying to get houston back in this game
move marlo into the slot jimmy peters to the outside 3 best corners on the field like last year dont want to see averett out there
late to the party but wtf was that illegal contact call why didnt the refs just give them 3pts
i dont like how much lamar is getting hit in the pocket so far this season protect the franchise
honestly thank god for the lj fort tdotherwise this would be an uncomfortable 1310 lead

we get the ball at the start of the half keep up the faith flock
harbaugh mask tastes good
thank god for tucker where would we be without him
averett stinks but that was a hell of a throw by deshaun
get averetts trash ass off the field fuck
trade or sign another cb averrett cannot play
bench averett play jimmy
offense needs to turn it up a bit defense is going to be a little gassed long drive
jesus christ i had no idea fairbairn was this good
i was wondering why lamar looked so slow until i saw the 21 on the jersey

ingram hell yeah coach lets go for it
we all feeling a little anxious with the game acting like 30pts aint our base line
stanley isnt known as a run blocker but holy crap was that great
where are all the greg roman is trying to be too cute comments
big truss no little truss
why is ingram always physically abusive to opposing teams logos lmao
big rb no lil rb
team looks inconsistent asf and we still drop 38 30 scary
mahomes is 1328


i sprinkled the old bay on my natty right before that drive good luck charm i think so
tavon youngs injury is gonna be a hit to the secondary
love that harbs trusts lamar
im a little disappointed with how little weve run ingram tbh
show the replay of the dq

why is the broadcast so bad about showing replays today
whens the last time tucker kicked 4 fgs
really puts into perspective how fucking incredible our team is that i somehow feel disappointed with todays game
dobbins only if you could broke that off for a td
dobby is free
pick your poison of which rb you want to fuck you up
wannabe lamar runs to get wannabe tucker in position for chipshot field goal
wonder how some of you fairweathers wouldve handled the flacco regime lmao
why do i even come to this thread when were not winning by 40
the ravens didnt finish with 200 yards rushing


jk you fricken moron
important to remember we are probably the best offense in the league every team is going to bring their best effort each week lamar making good decisions today o line needs to give him more time
dont forget to switch to incognito browser guys we about to watch a whole team get fucked by a beautiful black man
useless broncos
i still dont understand how ricard missed that block on 2nd down
that jet sweep with hollywood went so bad lol
fuck these indoor stadiums with concrete floors
were only 13 minutes real clock not game clock into the game and my anxiety is already sky high
this play calling is weird as fuck
what is going on right now is the offense not in sync this game
ok all these designed lamar runs why
its points ill take it
remember last year guys it was 00 against the texans late into the 2nd quarter we then won 417
i miss yanda
ill take that instead of watson getting sacked and then starting our drive in our own half
earl who
thicc ricc
heh my wife just called the last 2 plays i married a winner
no crowd noise being pumped in pretty sure i hear crowd noise
gonna be a close game but we got this
i swear hollywood looks like a kid playing with adults
were playing okay just a few miscues here and there no worries
thats a fucking touchdown
marlon humphrey is literally one punch man hahaha
thats a fucking touchdown
dude lj fort i dont know how hes so good but he is
thanks for cutting lj pittsburgh

edit trading
robbed the rams
thats mr mpjuiceman sir
i love ravens football
peters is an insane ball hawk
the o line is worrisome
these fucking refs hahaha
cobb was being a fucking bitch
they just fucking gifted the texans a field goal to keep them in the game what fucking bullshit
trash refereeing
on some drives we look elite other drives we look lost lol
bills beat the dolphins by 3 and now allen is leading the mvp race bills fans are so special
rbs need to be involved in the offense second half texans gonna keep getting to lamar if the playcalling revolves around lamar dropping back on 90 of snaps way too predictable
i know we are up two scores but it doesnt feel like offense is off sync and defense is struggling to stop watson not to mention the refs helped with two bs calls at the end
what the fuck is an illegal double team block
hello oline can you please show up
peters almost stripped the ball
fire averett into the goddamn sun
not having tavon in there is a liability hope hes alright
harbaugh looks pissed
week 2 ppl calm down
trade 93 he sucks so bad s
somehow held them to a fg you want to see frustrating block the kick

roundhouse kick the logo

what a fucking play
when in doubt truzzzzzzz
no little boi
hell yeah coach lets go for it
wildcat on 4th and 1 td
we want the chiefs

we want the chiefs
that brian billick offensive genius finally coming to fruition i knew he had it in him
mark ingram becoming chuck norris
calais campbell probably reminds offensive players of when they first saw california redwood trees shallnotpass
fairbairn aint half bad
horrible spot wtf
andrews held that block and that was a td
sad news to report patriots rb james whites father was in a car crash today and did not survive his mother was also in the car and is in critical condition

whites father tyrone was a captain with the miamidade police department

james was told and is inactive tonight andyslater
fuck the titans
i wanted mandrews td but i guess
bruh dobbins is fucking unreal
fucking chargers choked
we have so many weapons its hard to involve them all miles boykins looks really good so far
just because we havent scored 2 tds yet doesnt mean the sky is falling this will be a close game
if we blow out the texans itll be because theyre bad yet if the steelers go 20 its all about how theyre back just like the browns when beating up the bengals
this poor guy is so injury prone
tavon and injuries is an iconic duo i do not enjoy
i remember when we had mark ingram those were the days
roman trying too hard
patrick queen is everywhere wow the dude is so fast
jihad ward has 2020 foresight
i love yall but these comments have me seriously questioning yalls knowledge of the game
imagine not converting on 4th and 1 in your own territory and the opposing team scores a touchdown
i feel like boyle has been stopped inside the 5 like 45 times now in his career
ofc the best heisman house commercial is the one with lamar in it
lmfao these dudes cant get set and a play off in time with no crowd noise texans are bums lol
gotta start sacking this dude
justin hands tucker
hey guys fgs give us points too some of the people in here are wayy too spoiled
someone here just called for a marlon type of play good job honey
one punch man marlo
marlon is so good at punching the ball out
humphrey was destined to be a raven
marlon humphrey is like the one punch man of the nfl
man lj has been a beast for us
thats a fucking td
baller ass play so lucky to scoop fort
lj fort is a damn good player he was only a journeyman because the rest of the league didnt know how to use him
get marlon the brinks truck
man if we had a pass rush wed be nastyyyyy
i audibly yelled holy shit
even peters looked surprised that he got that as he got up lol
petition to change marcus peters nick name to mp grape juice man
haha why is mp wearing a winter hat in texas in september love that guy
so the wide receiver can just barrel into the corner and get an illegal contact
fuck off refs
every time i hear number 23 i forget who the fuck it is

then remember why i dont remember every time

averett is just erased from my mind
these refs are actually so trash
why is averett on the field when jimmy smith exists and brandon carr is a fa
what the fuck is that
these refs are actually missing chromosomes
what a gift of 3 points man
that was some bullshit bullshit calls meant to give the texans come points smfh i hope we come back out and destroy them
grade a bullshit ref texans should thank them for the 3 points
everything about that drive was horseshit officiating

lol torrey vs pollard
jk with the ray rice type crawl
offensive line is getting exploited today not good moving forward
damn our oline blows today
phillips is gonna lose starting position i bet dude is not great
that kick was reminiscent of the game winner in the playoffs against denver same distance and looked the same

also how the fuck was that not pi on andrews
oline looking shaky but well bounce back
o line looks atrocious today
we have arguably the best offensive tackle duo in the league but the interior oline is looking like a big liability that just cant stay the case moving forward
too many fgs today roman has to get away from drop back pass plays down field and run some quick slants draws or something to slow the rush because our o line cant
should be 27 7 smh
clay matthews is at home watching our abysmal pass rush
russ wilson looking like lando calrizzian
my names anthony averett and i use cable
get averrett off the field
averet giving chykie brown flashbacks
shocker averett getting bitched as usual
it feels like were playing so bad but were still up 13 with 1 quarter left i am becoming very conscious of how spoiled we are
if they get this its still a 10 point game just need to pound the rock
i love the home crowd boos when theres no home crowd
a long scoring drive would do a lot for us right now boys and the great llama still need to tack atleast 2 tds to his stat sheet
bill polian finally got his wish lamar lined up at wr
big nutz harbz
big boy no little boy
tucker got a lot of fantasy points this game too
toooooouchdownnnnn raaaaaavennnssss

and a beating on the texans logo


this is why we will always be that team to go for 4th down
chiefs are looking very soft and very beatable today love to see it
how did fort miss that sack
its crazy that this is an off day for the team
if kc loses to herberts first start
i think thats a good challenge lamar might have gotten it
aaaaaand unclench
was against the decision but i cant be mad with the outcome
im calling it defense with a garbage time int
this game was just so we could get jt some reps
dobbins is gonna be a superstar
yo dobbins is wild for real
jk but he aint joking
love watching dobbins speed to get to the edge tough enough to bang through the center and good contact balance to break tackles the future is bright
man itll feel like an eternity until next monday
so they just forgot about tucker butker best in the league
im going to run that play on my wife tonight
i much prefer when the ravens reach the end zone instead of the texans perhaps the ravens should do that more
the ravens are playing very well for my birthday today just a few observations

im liking a lot of jacksons decisionmaking a couple high throws esp the throw on the dig route that was caught by the jumping wr but overall hes been good

averett is not a starting db hes committed a couple dumb penalties and left his assignment open a couple times

i like the dl pressure on watson still stunned he got away from a sack

a solid 710 performance

the illegal contact calls were pretty tickytacky calls i saw a little bit of contact on the one replay that they showed on the first call but i wouldve not called either
how are we beating kc next week as if they arent struggling against the chargers right now

theyre obviously the team to beat and will be tough to beat but some of you need to chill
how is this trash o line going to stand up to kc next week
wtf is this play calling rn
wish we would run it more
decent drive sucks we didnt come out with 6 but miles better than our first drive
patrick queen is everywhere and i fucking love it
wish that att girl was my friend and nothing else
how did he get up so fast lmao
way to make up for last weeks fumble ricky
lamars about to bring me back from 40 points down in fantasy
got up like a man possessed
lol my boy ricard aint letting that ball go for anything
that cat commercial was terribly awesome
we need to trade for a real pass rusher tbh

an edge
the only time we get anything remotely close to a good pass rush is when we scheme up a blitz that gets a us a free runner to the qb we dont have anyone that can beat their blocker
annoying hope the defense can clean up a bit like last week too watsons obviously better than mayfield though
watson is good guys we are not playing against baker
bless u tucker
we fine yall even when the offense looks out of sync were gaining yards and getting first downs
fruit punch is back
he totally scored there
marlo has mastered the peanut punch
fuck kiko alonso
we ask for turnover we receive we ask for td we receive i love the llama era
lj fortmost underrated ravens fa signing ever
defense is nasty i just wish we had more of a passrush
lj fort is the ravens defensive mvp so far this year who wouldve thought
quick reminder that lj fort wasnt even on a team this time last year decosta has a knack for finding talent where no one else does
chiefs are losing i just wanna see that team become human
lj fort consistently proves to me why he deserves to be my new favorite linebacker
i like that from harrison
mp juiceman he got that ju ice in him
fruit punch straight to the juice man 2020 no fly zone baby
bro this defense is nasty
holy fuck that was beeeeeautiful
i would pay to have a live stream of marcus peters micd up
its just the browns right
what a catch
jesus h christ i love this goddamn football team
that pick might have been the best catch so far this game
man that int was incredible all hands full extension against the grain while going to the ground
give me mp juiceman over ramsey every day of the week and twice on sundays
okay justice hill in a commercial lol random
what an interception holy hell mp juiceman
get ronnie out
how long would it take marshal to put on 100 lbs
this game is a good example of badly we miss yanda not only his blocking ability but his line calls as well
good guy marcus peters lmaoo
pussy ass call
our pass rush sucks but to make it worse they cant tackle whatsoever we miss 90 of our chances at sacks which are already rare
sorry but these are just some bad calls not too upset with our d this drive
wtf just happened
what the hell is happening
these fucking refs wow
how much bob paying these reff to keep his job
thats such bullshit
what the fuckkkk these refs
still up by 10 and we get the ball to start the 2nd half
the ravens are going to have to dial up some quick hitters the texans are sitting deep like they did against the chiefs

lamar gotta look for his checkdown 3 sacks at the half against this defense is keeping the game from being a blowout
is it part of the defense exhausted fresh dobbins in gameplan or why on earth isnt jk getting any carries
man im so happy to have ray rice back
how was that not dpi mckinney never gets his head around
wheres our illegal contact call
its like were fucking shocked they blitz everyone on 3rd downs theyve been doing it all day
can greg roman realize theyre blitzing those situations and get some designed out of pocket throws
maybe we can finally get some pressure
averett did something

edit nvm
averette giveth averette taketh
why the fuck do we have avrett covering cooks
someone has to gif queen jumping on the pile
queen looking extra and i like it
me how are we going to beat the chiefs with this oline and without tavon

also me looks down and sees that chargers are up on kc 176
jj watt again is good at this football thing
ingram really just spin kicked that wall lmao
i cant believe that worked lmfaooooo
lol thought that was lamar
no little boy

this game has felt like just a fucking grinding slogfest cant believe we are up by as much as we are that fumble return was huge
did ingram just karate kick the texans logo merciless
omg that play design was so fucking good too roman showing off
what blocking on that play i will want to know what lamar did out there tbh
the force is with us
that td took watson soul you could see it as soon as he seen the td
lamar and hollywood on the bench there is so fun to see
why did they kick
time to run that clock out
now that i feel comfortable that we will win i will give props to justin reid he has been very strong for the texans in these first two games
he definitely got it
the gus bus is in full service
what did blacklock do
hey guys pro tip stop going out of bounds
no idea why gus and ingram didnt just fall down in bounds
cant wait for ravens wired this week just to hear ingram after the 4th down td
dobbins isnt human
that was a stumble away from a touchdown

dobbins future is so bright man i am pumped
i cant tell if the texans totally dont give a shit anymore or that was a truly phenomenal run
jk aint kidding
guys guys guys we are so lucky what a team we have
good win tavon young injury sucks but given what a bloodbath this sunday was i think we got off light
about tavon young

by video worry for acl injury his day is done and maybe season too many of those today 1 is too many profootballdoc
sometimes i wish lamar would run
i am scared for next week
we miss yanda
everyone is downplaying how good watson is dude is a great qb he is gonna make some good plays against any defense
go ravens fuck pittsburgh
back up qb gives steelers trouble

steelers fans ben is back

how are people picking this team to win our division
nfl contractual obligations lets go ravens
tavon exhibiting his allglass body again
the fact he was able to walk is a good sign
whos elizabeth patrick is the only queen i know
this sub was moaning 90 seconds ago were spoiled
lamar is doing everything the team need to wake up
lamar almost made that work insane
something seems off
i kinda forgot what a fourth down felt like
solid drive
gotta use these rbs more

lamar can do it himself but he doesnt have to
still fucking got it
henry cavills like 40 and mbb is like 16 who tf did the casting for this movie the age gap is absurd for siblings
so thats how that feels
well its a good thing watson didnt get sacked now
thats my quuuueeeeennnnn
patrick queen roty no doubtttt
houston decided the cleveland fake punt worked so well last week they thought theyd try their own dumb play in their own zone

now run the ball please
poor nick he almost gets there every time then somebody else scores the td
good to see ricard getting involved
i was watching ravens higlights from 2018 and nick boyle was one of the like 3 main players who are still on the roster
ricard making it up for last week
james harrison fan duel commercial greatest thing ive seen all day
there is no fullback in the game that didnt start off in baltimore that would have made that catch
imagine getting scored on by a defensive tackle
damn guys this the season with the worst injury bug to the league half the niners are injured and saquan barkley had to be carried out the game with a knee injury damn i really like barkley and his season might be over in week fucking 2
any updates on tavon
pass rush is fucking ass wtf
pass rush needs an upgrade asap
texans run a pretty similar offense to ours
thats ok will get it back
everybody calm down our shoutouts are fun but these dog fights make the game so much more exciting
texans are playing a lot more physical imo
they always try to jinx tucker smh
lets have a stop here
yall chill out were winning its early relax
humphreys right hook is legendary
challenge thats a td
fruit pawnch
it kinda looked like he scored there
my fantasy team would really love this to be a td thanks tony
i do not see how fort was down
theyre going to rule that a td
i dont see where he went out of bounds
lmao give lj fort some offensive carries
fort looked scary af running that ball
to think the steelers didnt want fort and his massive fucking biceps
wow fort looked amazing that scoop the carry the eye for blocking the dive at the end

he must have played lots of offense in high school or something looked natural out there

also that was a td
i love overreacting at the slightest hindrance but also screaming my throat out at play like this being a ravens fan is so fun
see yall relax
little known fact lj stands for lyndon johnson
dont get me wrong im always happy whenever we get a td but you just love to see a guy happy on the sideline happy for you fort
fruit punch
take in we found out about lj fort at our joint practice with the eagles last year he impressed and we stole him from their practice squad now hes absolutely balling
justin tucker with another kick hes getting tired

i love kevin harlan
thank god we finally woke up
my god what have we done
good shit peters lets fuck em up
god i fucking love our secondary
i almost yelled reeeeeeeeedddddd
holy shit

these defense is scary
im ready for rg3
lmfao imagine taking jalen ramsey over marcus peters
this is the greatest day ive had since last sunday
fruit punch and juiceman
we are going to be getting some bandwagon fans this year arent we i havent seen a ravens team this good in fucking years
damn obj is getting manhandled
we need to get yanda beefy again and get him suited up
wtf is happening with this line at least stanley is walking it off but fuck man yandas absence is hurting us
please be okay stanley
what is our oline doing 2nd last year today we look like 2nd to last come on now
what a bullshit call on averett
someone fire up the bull shit chant
how the fuck do they miss that hold on judon jesus christ
averet is horrible man
that was a bs call averett getting targeted
those are some shitty penalties how the heck can a receiver just bowl somebody over and get the flag
why did the fucking clock stop what
but they didnt have a to and didnt spike it
ill take a 2010 lead on the road while getting the ball to start the 2nd half but definitely had a couple missed opportunities

shoulda scored off the peters pick oline needs to play way better but overall a great first half
nontraditonal quarterback play how traditional we talking because im sure lamar is more throwback than most
the texans have turned the ball over 3x yet are only down 10 they held the ravens to 2 field goals and sacked them out of fg range for a third

this may sound weird but the texans defense is actually doing a decent job while sticking to their game plan stop the run all costs get the ravens to 3rd and long hunt

good thing our defense has been opportunistic our offense hasnt turned the ball over

w all of that being said the ravens could win this game going away if they get their ground game going tire out the texans defensive front this game is done
fuck yeah lets run with gus more

next play hit behind line of scrimmage
he didnt play that ball am i crazy
was that not pi the defender wasnt looking for the ball
how was that not pi
orlando brown hardly even trying right now
so thankful we have tucker
how was there no pi on that throw to marky mark bruh
i like running that clock down lets keep doing that
damn man 4 sacks wowwww
you know i understand we are winning and everything

but these refs need to call penalties correctly if that was the texans that would be pi on us give us a break
chances we see fluker next game
we are good but i feel like this team needs a wake up call
wilson looking like pablo escobar lol
get avrett some help
averett is so fucking bad
ill say it again averrett needs to be off the field
stop letting them hang around
wow 4th q already our first drive was amazing time killer now got to get them off the field on 3rd and long
hold em to 3 here and put em away next possession
averet out there giving me sharese wright flashbacks
queen jumping on that pile was a real ravens move love this kid
hopefully we follow up with a nice long drive for a score to ice it
lmao who yelled oh my god
seeing baby yoda made me feel a little less anxious
i dont think watt played in our game last year he has been the difference today
mark motherfucking ingram
big boi no lil boi
tears thats my running back
hahaha that kick in the ez haha
big balls harbaugh
big truss ingram
woo woo
six points
lol hollywood trying to bully through two guys for 3 yards and a 1st down was kinda funny especially when mark breaks a 30 yard td right after it on 4th down
only way i would have loved that more were if it were a direct snap to ricard who then threw a td pass to lamar because why the fuck not lamar needs to add not bad for a wide receiver to his resume
bigggg boiiii
i fucking love that creativity in the play calling
you say big truss you get a big upvote
i thought that was lamar lol
we scored 30 on an off day against a competent opponent we aight
feel bad for watson get my guy a real franchise
elliot is loads better than earl at blitzing
alright 99yd td to hollywood go
score again
i dont mean to alarm yall but the chiefs just tied with the chargers
good challenge low risk high reward even if he doesnt get it its just a qb sneak
why did 90 get ejected
any have a gif of what got that texan ejected
lamar humphrey peters ingram tuck queen andrews hollywood all killin it

but yo it feels so good when our support guys are making monster plays fort obviously but gus bus making big moves snead has been a monster anytime the balls been near him boykin making some huge blocks d line getting tons of pressure i love this team
pass rush has been better in the 2nd half
daaaamn jk
rides him down like a rodeo cowboy oo
seriously not fucking fair to have ingram gus and jkand justice hill
next weeks game is going to make me drink heavily
well a rookie threw for over 300 on this d hopefully lamar can do the same
no pass rush is going to be the death of this team
you guys are honestly the worst sometimes holy shit
t young is made of phone chargers
not again tavon
good thing we have cb depth
god damn feels so bad for tavon hopefully hes good
theres going to be sooooo many commercials
and the sunday of a million injuries strikes baltimore

queens got a motor on him good
queen was a great pick up never gives up on the play
run the fucking ball
offensive line does not look good so far
even with the oline woes and tavon injury we can all take some chicken soup for the soul and watch tucker work his craft
where can i get that face cover that harbaugh is wearing looks like the md flag but with ravens colors
tucker still fucking has it
offensive line needs help
53 wont hear the end of that
dont forget yall this is exactly how the game started last year we won no contest 5 times over chill
ward is too big for that shit
hey only we can do that
lmao dumbass bill obrian
great pressure those past 2 plays now turn this into a td

if theyre going for it on 4th and 1 on their own 30 you know theyre scared
just remember last year when we played the texans we started slow
yas queen
off topic but how the fuck did the cowboys win their game
what an amazing catch by project pat
i feel so much better now lmao
okay be honest who had picard picked for a td
celebrate good times come on
lol imagine giving up a receiving td to a defensive lineman
what a catch by ricard wow
and yall were worried in the first half trust in lamar
kc is getting beat by the chargers
gonna need to answer those short te passes over the middle
our pass rushers especially unblocked blitzers need to play with discipline in the backfield and stop blowing past deshaun every time
im out of beer

this is a tragedy
ordered some doordash sushi if i die i die
where is jk
still fuckin got it
glad were getting points but wish we could be turning those into tds
god i love humphrey thats a td
the marlo punch is baaaack
that was a td wtf

you know what im talking about to juju
marlo with the punch
thats a td
marlon fuck yea baby
fruit punch baby
that bounce off the fumble was perfect for fort

if this gets upheld the ravens better make it count
marlons punch is legendary
even if its not a score i think we can punch it in from the 1 hopefully with jk cause i flexed him in fantasy lol
give that man his touchdown
theyre reviewing the turnover can they change it to a td if they see it
thats a touchdown
pay llama pay humphrey pay stanley
our secondary is scaryyyyyy marlo with a big forced fumble
the way marlon punches the ball out so well reminds me of peanut tillman

fbi officer tillman is currently a 2020 hof nominee

all hail king marlon
lj fort was such a good pick up
i was surprised the broadcasters werent calling out that it was an obvious td
linebacker unit is looking very solid
i like when kevin harlan does our game
defense woke up just how i like it dirty
marcus peters legendary
peters grew three feet on that dive

my god this defense yall
juice juice juice
defensive play of the year right there
holy shit i think peters just pulled a micheal jordan and grew six feet for that pick
dear lord what a catch
but muh defense

you people are so impatient
has juiceman always been his name
what a pick dudes a bonafide stud
hope tavon is ok
we are almost too good of a team everyone is going to start hating on us
the talent on this team is absolutely disgusting
id like to apologize for my doubts when the game began
i literally yelled ohhhhhh when peters got that int
o line might be the only negative this half so far
can watt




love how the fg target line cbs makes for tucker is at like the 45 lmao
stanley down noooooooo
dobbins cant block
buying offensive line 10k west varrock bank
offensive line has room for improvement
this is like worst o line performance ive seen since like 2017 they got 3 sacks on lamar not even fucking aaron donald got a touch on lamar last year
shitty playcall considering how bad the line has been
averett has not had a single positive play his time here
how many times can judon fly into the backfield and whiff man
thanks refs
wtf why did they give them extra time
refs are the best players on the texans
houston clawing and scratching to just stay within 10
suck a nut refs
before that last drive i was just thinking how the refs have been pretty decent thus far this season after that drive what the damn hell refs you piece of shit
officials kinda lost the handle over that last minute
offensive is a bit shaky defense are killing it
offensive play calling is absolutely embarrassing when did we bring marty back
i know you guys think we need to win this game by 50 but i just want to avoid the injury gods at play today i will consider that a win
pollard acting like a clown on twitter again to no ones surprise
were playing okay considering everything o line needs to step the fuck up no more sacks
should we rotate fluker in at rg
im just gonna say we still adjusting to lack of pre season fans i mean these 10pts dont feel great to up by but its not like we down 8pts to a rookie qb right now
we scored 20 points on a playoff team in their stadium were doing more than fine
the ravens put in a run

this sub i pretend i do not see it and continue to complain about throws
just had flashbacks of ray rice dobbins is money
ahh you got me short of the first jk
long ass drive
shouldnt the defender have turned for the ball
awful oline man smh
that was a close one there tuck
still fuckin got it
i wish this game was more like our last matchup
this oline needs to get their shit together quick
didnt realize we were playing sfs allworld dline today embarrassing
this ol play is pathetic
this o line smdh

what was that sack number 4

need to get that shit straight
oline was shit week 1 alsothey had terrible grades
queen is fast as hell
dont even bring 23 home with us god awful
of course it was on averett how the fuck is this guy still on the team
plz get averett outta here
averrett getting absolutely demolished here
patrick leaping on the pile lmao
look i get being homers but the fact that a lot of people cant respect what watson does is kinda sad hes playing a great game so far they better not win or ill probably join the blind homerist discussion but at least give respect where respect is due
averett has singlehandedly put bend dont break back on the menu
need to put the nail in the coffin on this drive td and games over
not sure why youd go for 3 here
alright same drive as the last one and lets go home and get ready for kc
deshaun looks sad lol
i just creamed my pants
what a fucking play call
watching in my hotel room on stupid gamecast and holy tits im hyped
i love that we went for it on 4th there great call and great execution
ok low key was like wtf is this wildcatill sit down
22 on 4th down conversions
i cant wait for ingrams post game at the mic
watsons having a decent game today will give him that
do we have any update on tavon havent heard anything from announcers
tha j o k e r
i truly do not understand how some analysts had deshaun watson rated above lamar going into this season
good challenge
good challenge here dont get it we can go for it on 4th and we burn a time out which we may not need get it and its a 1st
challange it man he stretched out it should be good
go for it all aboard the gus bus
bleed the clock
all aboard the gus bus
gus edwards is the rg3 of the rbs lol show up to close it out
gus is a starting rb
gus bus lets go
theeeeeee wheels on the bus go move bitch
why did this guy get dqd
stop running out of bounds
thats like 80 seconds that should be off the clock roman fucked up
the two sweeps were really crap calls regardless points are points gg houston
why did that player get ejected i didnt catch it
the shots of the texans sideline makes them all look depressed


jk just ripping off 40 yard run like its nothing
man i wish hed of scored on that would of made flexing him worth it
rides him down like a rodeo cowboy wat
i almost feel bad for the texans after getting pounded by ingram and edwards dobbins comes in and absolutely gashes them
yabba dabba dooooooooooooooo
can we talk about half time adjustments both weeks so far especially the oline this week rbs have had great vision but oline just blasting holes
20 bring on the chiefs
no lie the la stadium looks amazeballs
ok that dude kicked three 58 yd field goals two in a row after an ice timeout
sometime my inner masochist wants tucker to kick my balls his amazing leg caressing my scrotum would truly be sensational
people are acting like the texans are a bad team they were literally up by like 21 or something against the superbowl champions in the playoffs last year this game isnt going to be like last week
with this oline the steelers might have a fucking field day with us gah damn
cbs production has been very poor today
this sub is spoiled as hell tho why the hell are some of yall complaining when were up 10 and getting the ball to start the 2nd half on the road

ill take this shit every week
this subs annoying if we arent crushing the other team
what the fuck is our offensive line doing theyre traffic cones right now for the texans and oh boy stanley might be injured again just great here comes another game where lamar has to do literally everything for the offense
talk about keeping a team in it at the end of the half
refs gave them 3 points
texans are such pussies for taking a fg although i guess it was fourth and 15
oh i see the chiefs are clearly going to win lol
cbs needs to hurry and put this game on lol
damn judon almost had him
im fucking done with tavon lets draft slot cb
a sight all too familiar to us flocktavon young making a great defensive play and then limping off the field
the number of big names going down to injury today has me quite concerned for our boys and even more so now
they should ban turf
please fucking run
what are they cheering about a helmet to helmet hit lol
today is fucked ill die if lamar gets hurt
lamar showing elite composure rn
i get that the texans are running 8man boxes all day but do we only have one rush from an rb so far
i miss yanda
playcalling reminds me of the bills game too much trickery i guess were putting it on tape for the chiefs but we
both o lines look terrible dshaun must be use to by now
dang nice moves watson
big props to ward for letting that sack go and avoiding the horsecollar had both hands inside the jersey at the neckline
good gracious what a freaking escape by watson
already in fg range sick
lets go joker szn
tells you what they think of their chances today that theyd go for that
good shit elliot
lol bill obrien is fucking stupid
at least the texans failed on that 4th and 1
hell yeah
man my stream is sloow
lets get ittttt
lamar really making project pat work for that td lol great play though
pat looked like hes made of rubber
is is me or did joker just play that like e dub and force watson to call timeout
wait theres no crowd noise then where is all that cheering coming from
damn it i hate when they get first downs
wow that was sloppy no pressure and left wide open
pass rush is garbage when just 4
we need pash rush right now
whos fault was that on the deep pass elliott
thats fine respond right back
wheres the pass rush
i hope the downers here realize in the game of football both teams usually give up a touchdown or two a game not every game is gonna be 456 calm down everyone
fuck off baker we dont care about your book club
lamar looks unbelievably calm out there amazing how he continues to get better
i hope we invest in the online next year hate seeing lj run for his life
sam koch can secretly throw tucker can secretly catch i think we found our next qbwr duo
mr automatic
we arent sneaking up on anyone texans are facing 02 and theyre ready for us
how perfect is it to have a fort on defense
no fucking way this team is incredible
damn thought he was in lol glad we got that all the same
thats what im talking about d lj fort marlon
thats a td
lj taking over the game
i love marlo

this game is about to get ugly cant help but feel terrible for deshaun he deserves so much better
fruit punch
pay peanut holy fuck what a play by fort theyre gonna show that all week
yeah thats going to be a td
definitely a tuddy awesome stuff pretty sure judon got blocked in the back on the rush too
tuddy all day
goddamn the defense does not look sluggish
td confirmed
i love marlon
lamar jackson fort
dang harrison is fast
what a pick
im gonna nut
god i love our corners
we feasting today bois
ballhawkin peters wow
mp juicemannnnnnn
after a slow start ravens are back baby mp juiceman in the house baby
marcus fn peters
dude should be a wr lol
lets fucking go marcus peters

defense rolling now
about to be back to back years of having two all pro corners
holeeeee fuckkk what an int
deshaun looks scared against our d just like last year
mp juuuuuuiiiiceman
hell yeah d
yall have no faith
im so fucking glad weve got peters for a 5th rounder
mp juice man they thought it was sweet but it was really sour
this is a championship type defense turnovers are strongly correlated to super bowl runs
ravens mvp kaare vedvik
dear god i remember like 6 seasons where we didnt have a single wide receiver that could make that catch
lamar just felt bad that watt hasnt had many sacks lately and wanted him to feel good good guy lamar man
how much farther back is tucks fg target line than other teams
weirdly poor pocket presence there from lamar had an opening to his right but twirled into that sack
ronnie stanley is hurt
yanda come back
ronnie pls
online is awful today
lamar having louisville flashbacks with this o line play today
anthony averett is def our worst corner
why does it take literally our entire defense plus a couple camera guys to tackle watson
averett needs to be off the field right now
lmao fucking bullshit call
omg these calls
that ol is not ideal
soft as shit call
levine averrett having shit games
fucking home job
jesus christ averett is piss poor per the usual is their no free agent or practice squander out there
seeing averett out there is giving me flashbacks to last years browns loss god he is awful we need tavon back
what the fuck is that call
what in the world
id rather have canady than averrtt hes just horrible
what the everloving shit is going on with the refs on this drive
i think were a bit spoiled its the nfl were not going to dominate literally every playdrive of the game were up 10 at the half kc is down 8 we are an elite team but we arent perfect lets not lose sight of that
refs fucking called shit illegal contact then stop the clock
not getting points off of that turnover is rough
either flag us or keep the clock running wtf is a 4 second add
im mad but im also just plain confused wtf rule are the refs invoking here
blatant hold on judon right after the wiped sack
can someone get the oline motivated can we make some running lanes and get these backs going strong
we seem off offensive game plan seems off without the def td it would look a lot different at half hope we can adjust at half and settle some these guys dont look like they can play with our guys we should run them out of the place
we get the ball after the half just have to settle in more we know we have the talent
joe flacco kirk cousins
if theyre so disappointed in the run game how about running the ball more lol
boykin is much improved
harbaugh sucking on his mask looks so weird lol
is dobbins hurt is he active
exciting even when he gains one yard
when i drink stout we play questionably when i drink tequila we play consistent as fuck i know what i must do boys
teams are doing a better job of closing off the amount of space lamar has to work with
oh you thought he was down jk
wow what a play shades of ray rice vs cinci yearsago
how was that not pass interference

4 sacks today o line butt today
yo o line is straight trash
roman needs to run some screens
tucker out here doing trick shots on his fgs now
237 sounds a lot better than 2310
really need to rally that ol during this defensive series
taking a second to to admire tucker that fg was beautiful close but most would not have made it
they are abusing tyree and brown whew
ravens should have swallowed their pride and brought back osemele oh well
if this stream drops audio one more time im going to report it
everyone bitch in about this team even the play calling is fine we are not kc down 11 to a fucking rookie
watson is a tough mf to bring down
nanny mcphee seems to always be getting in the backfield today still goin strong
omg averett is garbage how do you give that up
averett is literally so fucking bad please cut his ass and start tucker
picking on averett bad
averatt is just getting demoralised
averette is ass
yeah get averett off the fucking field
avarett is not good i agree you just have to feel bad for the guy though will be picked on all game ever since both marlon and mp caused turnovers
averett consistently gets beat
damn what a throw watson
oh fuck off trent green
lol pq leaping on top of everyone else

this is my pile
they fucking dogpiled him lmao
it looks like we put in jimmy for marlon and gave marlon slot duty back while young is out
averett is showing why hes the 4th option
its not that he sucks its just that hes not a onehalf and two option on a starting defense
this drive has felt like forever
ohhhh my gawd
now lets just grind the hell out of them for 10 minutes and end this with a td

not sure why but ive got respect for jj his brother although good seems like a dirty player
watt has played really well credit where its due
big truzzzzzz
big boi no little boi

thats how you 4th down it baby
god i love this team so much
with the roundhouse kick lmao
errybody get in here we did a run block
kick that fucking bull lets fucking go
so everythings back to fine again
dis that dirty biiird gameplay i was promised
someone link the replay plz
harbaugh balls for calling a play like that
that was some tomfoolery play and i live for it
dang so many big name injuries today
why do i feel like 17 points still aint enough must be that cowboysfalcons game from earlier plus ill never count out watson
lmao hollywood dancing menacingly towards david johnson
a lamar td pass to hollywood to end this game would be absolutely pizza pie for me

hes the jokaa baybeee
deshaun gonna make some money he keeps this up
warm up the bus
here comes the passrush
time to feed those running backs
unpopular opinion we extend ingram for 2 years
lamar throws a somewhat wobbly pass for a touchdown and lamar gets roasted and mahomes finally ties the chargers and he gets wow just wow
203 career start not bad for a running back
kc is scary but at the end of the day is just about getting to the playoffs and being hot at that time
texans damn lucky that was an inch from being a touchdown
jeez i forgot we play kc next week huge game
yeah challenge the spot he reached that fd
i like this challenge looked close and we can just use it as a timeout to figure out things anyhow
assert dominance go for it and go long to hollywood
thats how you do it
the fake fake
big dick harbs
gus is a gamer
gus could legit be a 1 on a bunch of teams
this is why you pound the rock they know its coming and cant stop it easier for oline to runblock than pass block too gus has earned more touches
lightning mcqueen leading the team in tackles again loving this guy
please explain why is this player disqualified i dont understand ty
tickets please


the bus will be departing soon
replay of foul
anybody know what just happened
i want harbaughs neck gaiter
why do they keep running to the sideline cmon
cant believe we didnt throw once on that drive
i hope the people saying go for it arent serious
super bowl confirmed
thank god for that graphic i wouldve never known that guy won mvp
the ravens have generated 22 pressures today
dobbins yesss

run of the day
dobbins drop the taco judon get in the freaking bus

next week is gonna be a crazy game
texans have no heart left they do t give a fuck lol
i want a lamar touchdown
oof if kc loses to la theyre coming here fired up lol
ooo im so hyped for next week

lets gooooooiooo
here we go with the refs
dobbins needs to learn how to block
play calling seems to be a lil too cute right now
i dont like these play calls things feel very conservative right now
hollywood be frying niggas man lol butt ass ass naked out there
who the hell just said marlon needs to wake up the d with a big play damn sorcery
o line needs to step up but not as much as the officiating does i dont know how you miss the td live when its right in front of you and then the 2 illegal contact calls and the absurd pause to give the texans enough time to kick a fg is just inexcusable shit this crew shouldnt get another game this season
anyone concerned about the score is a 2019 era new ravens fan
o line is officially the weak link of team

some of you became fans of the ravens last season and it shows
im not sure where all of the chastising is coming from these gameday threads are literally all just hot takes its what you came here for and its just the nature of these threads
its kind of depressing without crowd noise
defense was pathetic that drive
ravens 20

texans 7

refs 3
averett shareece wright chykie brown maurice canady and dominique franks are the same give up a 10 yard catch on 3rd down corner change my view
lets fuckin feast
broncos keeping it close
lol denver is really pushing the squealers
looking at all the injuries this week i hope our ravens will be safe
you had one job denver
thank god we play the giants at home metlife field is ending everybodys season
jimmy gets by with a lil help from his friends 3
good shit jimmy
great 1on1 stop by jimmy
good start lets get it
i swear the biggest cheat code for our offense is 5 wide but we barely ever do it smh
i love how long nfl commercial breaks are
is tavon young made of glass
wow well its our turn i guess what a terrible day for injuries man
looks like he came down on that left leg and the knee just flexed out to the side no bueno
he was limping off i bet hes ok
someone spiked the nfls gatorade stash with bone hurting juice apparently
young is made of glass
could be ok fingers crossed
yaaaas queen
queen is gonna be a beast
fuck i thought the ball was out but it was just johnsons red shoes
how many times am i gonna have to watch mahomes play cornhole smh
run the fucking ball
lol run plz
does lamars balls look zippier today to anyone else like last year they looked solid but today the just shoot out
apparently everyone in here thinks they would be a better oc than roman
the oline doesnt exist today
i miss yanda
yanda plz comeback
what the fuck is our oline doing right now the texans are using them like turnstiles
why do teams still use turf jesus
can lamar not hit the hard ass fake field with his throwing hand cool thanks
the texans are playing great defense
on 3rd 7 why do we have 3 players running routes underneath the sticks
texans are playing well dont forget theres another team on the field we looked good enough
whats up with the fans on here making crazy takes after 2 drives same thing happened last week but for the defense
damn everyone in heres a better play caller than greg roman i guess from the sound of it
that was impressive by watson to break free from ward
ward just got daddied
jesus what a hell of an escape
earl who
fantastic fucking stand
holy fuck what a terrible decision
it pumps me up that our offense is so good teams have to take shots like that 4th and 1 and our defense is tough enough to shut it all down
lmaooo that was a ballsy move

opposing teams feel the needto be aggressive with us just like the ravens when we played kc i dont blame them going for it risky but it has to be done against high scoring teams
great clean stop

we got to punish these stupid decisions lets get 7
if we dont get 7 off this imma be pissed
so our offense is so freaking scary teams are running bad 4th downs in the hope they keep us off the field feels damn good
fuck yes
thats my blocking tight end fighting
pat ricard what a unit
big bois gotta eat what a play by ricard
what a snag
project pat
great catch
pat really redeemed him self from last week there
my erection enters the chat
going for it on 4th in your own territory is a bold move against this offense
awesome catch by ricard but poor boyle can never get in the endzone
captain ricard made it so
hopefully tavon can come back this year
cmon jimmy
fuck that was a nice catch by ricard
yasss its lamar
seahawks gonna bring cam back to reality tonight i think
thats a big yikes
thats on elliot

i never understood why some underestimate deshaun hes one of the best qbs in the league

ingram heard yall talking shit
put tucker out there in the slot
going from joe to lamar feels illegal
holy shit romeo crennel still exists
i love this belichick commercial lolll
feel like he couldve picked up the first
clean game so far no penalties no turnovers no sacks or pretty close to none

any turnover is gonna be big
d needs to step up no pressure at all
i swear i saw someone comment that we need marlon to force a fumble literally a few minutes ago
who needs a national game when you get kevin harlan
how is that not a td
thats 6 come on
humph with his finishing move
under review
lets gooooooo awesome
thats a td
i really need harbaugh to challenge this for my fantasy
bro imagine thinking youre gonna beat the ravens while giving up defensive touchdowns
lets go marlo
thats a td boys
humphrey graduated from the peanut tillman school for dbs in case anyone was wondering head of his class too
pay marlon
all pro marlo
fumble td
marlon hammer fist humphreys
goddamn that was an effort at the very limits of human capability for fort to get that in there amazing
tucker practicing his bending techniques on these kicks
mega hustle from fort

all right defense dont let up should be well rested after all the tv breaks and reviews
ya know arizona looks great this year
queen in coverage over a wr


fully erect
this team is fucking good
holy fuck peters
marcus fucking peters

what a fucking play
mp juiceman
i love mp juiceman
holy fuck what a fucking pick
mp grape juice man

oh my word
our defense is hungry

mpjuiceman looking like ed reed
what a game so far after that slow start

our elite corners showing out today
so what edge we trading for
td halftime td game
now its time to step on their throats and end this before the half lets go boys
lets gooooooo

chance here to pull a belichick special doubledip before end of half and we start the 3rd with the ball
mp ditched his man in the flat and double backed for the snag such a sneaky fuck love it
holy crap that int was fucking beautiful
peters took a page out of ed reeds book with that int
watt is destroying obj
i want you all to just take a moment to appreciate this special roster of guys we have right now dont take it for granted
i miss yanda
not today watt any other day is fine
not stanley
online playing like total dog shit today
oh fuck oh fuck not stanley please
averett is a bum
are you fucking kidding me
queen is an absolute beast
averett is such a fucking liabilty
fucking averett you know hes going to the sideline
lol wut
wtf averrett is allowed his field what a joke
fucking dammit you cant let deshaun do that
having not seen averette for awhile i completely forgot how trash he is
wtf just happened
houston a bunch of pussies
not worried couple of gifts from the refs there
lol thats bullshit
that one weak and simply wrong illegal contact call on the sack made the whole drive happen but that doesnt excuse every other play that was awful
refs were dogshit down the stretch that illegal contact on the sack was soft as fuck
this texans team is so trash were keeping them in the game god it must suck to be a fan in houston
that was legit you cant delay the game because the ref fucks up same thing as moving the chains if they arent set the refs can pause the game because they fucked up not the other team
dear god i hope uncle eric is on the phone calling someone to play corner next week
im still really confused why the refs gave them a free timeout not suspicious at all
were up 10 but only have 5 rushes by rbs i understand letting the defense pick their poison but you cant just allow them to get us out of our game
hey greg think youre gonna run it more than 5 times in the second half
pass protection has been crap need to run some drawsscreens or roll lamar out to slow them down
did dobbins get a single snap in that half
once again the coaches are forgetting that the ravens are a runfirst team
anyone else want to see some more 2 te sets and jk dobbins in the 2nd half

we need to slow this pass rush down
also our dline has gotten pretty good pressure but watsons athleticism is phenomenal
dont know why a lot of you are angry deshaun is going to make plays hes arguably a top 5 guy and were so lucky d hop aint playing with the texans anymore texans are bound to make more bone headed tos and bad plays we got this guys
its never worth to return kickoffs anymore because all of the flags and the small likelihood of actually getting past the 25
maybe the gus bus is like the texans kryptonite
ah yes the ol akron pros
dobbins staying up after that contact was amazing
dobbins aw jeez looks like you got me


that was ray rice like holy shit
jk ray rice
good read and play switch by lamar
dobbins good
wow thats was ray rice chills man spooky
obvious pi dude could be kissing mandrews
how was that good coverage
excuse me i forgot what does an oline do
scaring me there tuck
that was snuck in there damn
thank god we have tucker
almost had to burn down a village there for a second
llama gonna need some ice packs after this game
ok wtf is going on with our o line
god wont allow tuck to miss i swear
missing yanda so bad
this iol man
dude if our line is this bad call different routes spread them 5 wide call a screen do literally anything different jesus
i would really like fluker to start at guard for now he wouldnt get bullied in the run game
well its a good thing he overthrew that lol
wink bout to send some heavy pressure on the right side
i do think we see fluker at rg next week but yall saying brown jr looks bad and yanda made him good have apperantly forgotten who hes going against damn near every play id like to see a tackle playing next to a rookie guard that doesnt get eaten alive by jj watt
even with that sack watson looks like hes covered in oil lmao
why is averett on the field
fucking averett
averett cant keep up
what a fucking throw by watson
cut averett hes always the culprit
averett needs to be cut
picking on averett alllllll day
averett sucks
cant let them get more than a fg here with the amount of penalties and tfl we have had lets shut it down
avarett is already playing garbage time
please bench averett asap
line is starting to get pressure
queen be like i want the tackle too
we need tavon back man
yeah we do not have to do this averett experiment just play jimmy
i miss lamar 3
man i hope we can pound the rock and burn some clock on this next possession
i love winks scheming fuckin 8 defenders on the los
we need to put the texans away now this is the way
lol people are still roasting averette
herbert has 3 more completions than mahomes and 125 more yards
cactus jack sent me
its early but our ol just doesnt look the same in the run game yanda retiring skura not being 100 are 2 reasons why both opposing defenses have sold out to stop the run as well

as the new ol builds cohesion i think theyll start to dominate on the ground again
did lamar just reverse summersault
snead has the need for speed
i really like snead iv he shows up every game for something and that was a toughass run after catch
murray runs so weird
kyler murray has me worried if we meet them in the sb hes so much better this year
the best part about lamar is how much he just loves the game and everyone included breaks two tackles falls over the guys gets up helps them up and hugs both of the texans players
this just in lamar jackson sandbagging so that he could play a full football game

hell yeah coach lets go for it
so much for eating clock but fuck it lets goooooooo
not bad for a rb
he just cobra kaid their logo dayam
hell yeah coach lets go for it
cant hang thats fucking baltimore football right there
ingram was so hyped
thats how you do a 4th and 1

he busted roundhouse kick
we some kind of 1920s football squad
absolutely amazing blocking should be game lfg
ingram i love you

roman and harbaugh what a play call hats off
big boi run
the hays in the barn
we own this bitch
for all the problems with the oline were still firing on all cylinders and beating these mfers handidly
i love this team
i am suddenly a wildcat fan but only for one play
just when you thought this offense has done it all 4th down wildcat for 30 you have got to be kidding
lets get a 3 and out we can basically end the game

lets gooooo d
when deshaun has time he is absolutely surgical
calais there showing why he is great
elliott has been playing great safeties have been refreshingly good these last two games
stop turtling d
yeah we cant play like theres 2 min left
the pressure today hasnt been bad honestly
geeeeeez elliot

is watson blind lol i dont think it couldve been more obvious that we were sending the house
please eat the clock
not to be greedy but another lamar td would really save my fantasy team
gotta tighten up that coverage and pass block a bit better for kc next week other than that solid display of football for us
down by 17



kick a field goal
how are you not going to go for this
how the fuck do they not show a replay thats absurd cbs
that was a crazy play call
lmao im so glad we want to demoralize them and go for it
that scheduling does suck for houston i agree
hope houston destroys the steelers next week
now we are just demoralizing them
gus looks incredible right now
chargers about to score a td

they on the 3
damn gus is the closer
gus bus is so good
having gus is almost dirty we run ingram and dobbins all game then we send in gus against a completely wore defense
did anyone even see what got 90 ejected
235105 on the road
cunningham has a done a good job containing lamar credit where its due
running out of bounds on back to back plays not smart football
lamar td here pls
in the least weird way possible deshaun watson has got some smooth skin
kick the fg go up 3 and lets roll it out
if we score another td im gonna be 1 point off on the lucky guess thread thats gonna suck
its crazy to think about how we havent lost a single game since the browns week 3 might change next week but a 15 game winning streak is insane
i love kevin harlan
jk dobbins is electric
get him down


yo thats gotta be demoralizing as fuck

these little flashes of jks ability makes me hyped for how he is going to develop in this offense
ravens have 223 rush yards texans held up until the 4th and then boom
we almost have 4 guys with 50yrds rushing wonder if thats ever happened before
mahomes just picked up 3rd 20 on a run wtf
oh god here comes the pat mahomes comeback
settle for a tie cowards
fuck the chargers

were gonna do it by ourselves
lamar 37 for 46 398 5tds

































our o like is playing like shit but lamar is so good that hes only been sacked once
whew i feel so much better after we didnt score a touchdown on 100 of our possessions

lol yall need to chill
is watson covered in oil
the texans player placed the ball and then the ref kicked it backwards i guess that means they get a free timeout to get a fg
meh 10 up at the half ill take it
our oline couldnt block a light breeze today let alone a dline led by jj watt what the fuck are they doing
get avarett out ffs
bro fuck this announcer saying that was a penalty but the shit on andrews wasnt
god mahomes is going to fucking expose averett
niggas keep trying to tell me edwards is just a product on the offense dude is good
probably the most human ive ever seen lamar play
this was the weirdest blow out ever we had to try hard for it a lot of the other ones felt effortless
the hay is in the barn
i know our play calling has been questionable and the oline sucks today but shit are we spoiled with so many people complaining about not blowing out a good team
the other team is still allowed to score guys
fuck this call it a tie and try again next week

save the knees
tavon can sneeze and get hurt
18 games in 4 seasons for tavon if hes out for the season
literally the same start as the browns game go up 100 have a shitty defensive possession

tell me whats next
this offensive line is so bad
play fluker and mekari
we need to put a big hit on watson weve allowed him too much time and space to build confidence
kinda feel bad for the texans right schedule hard af kc us then pittsburgh next week damn
not surprising they picked up that 3rd and long on averett get him off the god damn field
30 to 13 but i feel like weve been playing pretty bad idk lol
steelers have a lot of game left the tv will cut to our game at the start wont they
steelers really blowing this shit lmao
broncos fucking suck
well if theres anything we learned its that the steelers defense is overrated
something bad teams have in common not blocking obvious free rushers haha
steelers almost lost to the jeff driskel broncos spooky
hope ingram goes off today
strap yourselves in here we go
kevin harlan lets gooo
campbell just reached out and grabbed that runner otherwise he was going at least several more yards
lol way to hold em jimmy

jimmy say heeelp
always hated jets sweeps
levine is just the best
ahh lamar shouldve probably tried that 5050 ball down the field on the right hand side
theyre clearly scared of watt disrupting the rushing offense
welp there it is
tavon looks like hes in a lot of pain
no tavon
ffs we were just talking about avoiding injuries thankfully he seems to be ok
goddamnit who put kneebreaking shit in all the fields this week
tavon pls no be hurt
meanwhile lmfao falcons they are the biggest choke artists in the nfl
walk it off young one
i had a bad feeling the rampant injury bug thats been hitting the league would bite us today
fucking week 2

edit i mean the amount of injuries around the nfl has been rough this week
itll buff out
anthony averrett
yas queen
queen with the hustle
why arent we even trying to run the ball
oline looks like ass
this oline play is terrible
rip tavon
at least he can walk thats good
hollywood could have blocked watt and was like lol no
all these injuries today has me fucking spooked for the lamar running game
maybe our front office will dial up some trades or something for the oline on the level of how they retooled the defense midseason last year
we had a slow start to the texans last year and still put up 41
always said o line is overrated the reason why teams dont get sacks on the ravens is because of lamar
let the ravens gain momentum theyre just powering up
we have 3 stellar rbs for sure dont hand the ball off once in a quarter
let lamar get a feel for what they are doing and he will adjust a bit
okay that was impressive
thats it im getting a beer
this is going to be a very fun game battle of crazy athletic qbs
evade 100
deshaun lamar jackson watson
that was honestly best case scenario because it could have easily turned into a horse collar
come on dont be shy slander the ravens defense some more
cant give the ravens offense great field position getting a td here would be huge
why do teams always try dumb ass 4th down attempts on us hilarious
hell yea boys lets get 7
watson loving the jump pass
bob is such a dunce
fucking huuuuuuuuuuuge
hell yes defense
how idiotic lmao
that was not a good decision two weeks in a row teams getting too cute on us
this game is already waaay better than the denver pittsburgh game
front 7 looks light years better
we just got the ball within justin tucker field goal range
it was actually a good thing that no one wanted to tackle watson on that play
man with all the speed on this offense boyle looks sooooo slow
you owed us that ricard
feel better now boys
ricardoh yea
lamar 2 td run yes
love this drive
patty ricard thanks bob
touchdownnnnnn ravens
great play from project pat
much better play calling lock clockwork when we on
thank you sweet lord baby jesus
the texans wanted to be us so bad by going for it on 4th down
has dobbins played a snap today
flip over to the wft at commercial just in time to watch haskins get pancaked

edit scary terry appears
bill obrien mvp
good shit ricard
first td

more to come
imagine using analytics and probabilities to get an edge in a football game only to see the effort benefit the other team congrats youre bob
i havent heard anything about it so im assuming clark still has the green dot
our run d is looking decent
also i do hear crowd noises pumped in do you guys not hear it
hell of a blown coverage

double fuck
if watson had time that was a td
does anyone know what pacific time the game is
need the offense to come out big this drive let the defense get some light under their feet and get back on top of things
this pass rush is gonna suck so hard next week
tavon being out does actually hurt us
ate a whole wedge of triple cream brie and its got me fucked up
fuck earl thomas bum ass for costing us 15 mil this year
bro ingram takes a fucking beating when he has the ball
oh my god if lamar starts working voice inflection into his repertoire thats it call it the mans in total sheriff bradyrodgers territory
lamar to tucker is now my ultimate dream play to see recorded in a regular game scorebook officially somehow
all i want this season besides a super bowl is a tucker tuddy
what cant tucker do

hollywood brown making catches like hes 69
lets go is it just me or does hollywood always land funny when he goes up for a catch
fuck running hes gonna be lamar rodgers from now on
tucker for wr
doctor my eyes just saw a pass from jackson to brown
lamar throwing way offscreen its going to hollywood
that was a fucking zinger to andrews but good defense
little too much on that throw

also fruit punch
did i just say i want a to yes i did

yaaasssss give me them turnovers
who in here said we needed a turnover td what a prediction
humph punch
build that fort and watch it stand

humphrey is such a beast

hes in come on
texans cant be serious
its not a td
the ball hit the pylon before he went out
oh wait we dont have to challenge because all turnovers are reviewed and they review the entire play this review will end with us kicking a pat
lamar jackson lj fort mchenry is in baltimore lj fort illuminati confirmed
lettss fockin goooooo

the wink defense has nasty punches peanut did it all the time too
all these great players were going to have to pay
went the bathroom guess that was a mistake
for you ravens fans to give some context here the wr that caught the ball does this so often he gives us flash of hopes and then does this and now will not play for the next 4 games probably lmoa
thank god that def looked like a legit td
im surprised but ill take it td
thats a touchdown
lets goooooooo ravens


houston blaming lack of energy on lack of crowd noise pretty sure houston would be silent regardless after that last td
marcus motherfucking peters

what a catch
holy fucking highlight reel
i think the d heard the shit you all were talking
mp juicemane
mp juiceman

thats a catch by a mile
good afternoon houston the juice man is here
oh yeah dont forget we have a defense
juice man
we starting to heat up
what a pick
marcus gonna start clowning them looks like lamar aint playing in the fourth
m p juice mayynnneeee
mp juiceman
mp juiceman god we are so lucky to have two stud corners
people still try to act like we dont have 2 of the top 5 corners
mp juiceman mp juiceman mp juiceman
turnovers win games turnovers lose games we on the right side of those tos
gimmie that
juice man juice man
yesssss what a catch
lj fort and mp masking our oline getting manhandled and the lack of a pass rush
td here and after the half and cruise lol

we are fucking scary i love it
bud light guy needs to brown bag that beer
lmao they making deshaun watch the pick
we dont stop the clock for out of bounds anymore
i love peters so much
gotta feel bad for watson honestly dudes just going to end up like andrew luck
i fucking love peters and humphrey duo keep them together
mp stands for magic powers with how he caught that oo
we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs


we want the chiefs
unfortunately for the texans theyre stuck playing the ravens on allmadden difficulty
man obj is having a rough start to the season garret last week and now watt
im not used to seeing stanley and brown getting pushed like this
well that wasnt good
stanley no
fuck it let tucker try it from ther e
what the fuck oline
o line pls
so i guess stanley now has injuries to 3 parts of his body
we cant lose stanley that could be devastating to the offense
do we actually have an offensive line
ok the entire oline needs to step up now without stanley
can yanda start eating again maybe he can make a comeback for week 4 or 5 just need him to get in lineman shape
the oline needs help idk why edc thought a third round rookie was gonna fill in for yanda
lmao an interception and the texans are gonna score
bullshit flag
averett is fucking trash
again come on
learn to tackle
what shit way to end the first half
averted shouldnt even be on the team anymore
rather have levine play corner than averette
remember when averett jumped over the fumble in kc and missed the ball entirely
our ilb is our best pass rusher good lord
shit needs to be said in the locker room shit needs to be said
damn our o line looking like a bunch of beanbags

wtf was that
we stayed really healthy last year you get some soft spots exposed if guys start getting dinged up
why did they give them time
fuck off come on
o line needs to be addressed asap
fucking unreal
actual bs but whatever
offense is just not getting it together defense keeping us in this game lets hope oline can get it together and lamar comes out angry in the second half to put together a td drive
this o line chris jones and the chiefs are gonna be licking their chops looking at this on game film

we need to get this shit straight

thank fuck lamar can throw cause the run game has gone to shit
when they stop the clock to call a penalty which ends up getting declined dont they have to impose a ten second run off
boykin is a tight end now i guess
boykins not a te
lamars composure today

but id like to see him scrambling to avoid those sacks a little more bully them into submission
these announcers called deshonn eliot a c and boykin a te so far
watt is a legit superstar his presence is felt this game
gus aka the bus
the ol isnt helping but the playcalling has left a lot to be desired so far
this is exactly why we should keep feeding the running backs
our backs are the best downhill runners in the game
omg close up of harbaugh eating his mask
feed gus
we had 3 lead blockers on that play and 3 players on the defense were around lamar unblocked within 3 yards
ray rice flashback
need i say im throbbins for dobbins
amazing play by dobbins staying up
i want to see a bomb to hollywood lol
dobbins is such a great pick
way to go jk
ray rice vibes
andrews almost got a hug for a td
thats a pi if the roles were reversed
yeah the oline is a worry
dude hollywood was wide open

andrews wanted to moss him so bad i would have nutted
i have faith in phillips but hes just not it yet
phewwww still fucking got it
this fucking oline already
o line is booty
tucker really scared me there
o line stand between the rusher and lamar pls
i miss yanda
thank god for tucker
offensive line straight dog ass
orlando let that blitz right in untouched smh
still fucking got it
is our ol bad or is houstons dl good
the oline is lookin like swiss cheese
just seeing how close he can kick it to the upright without touching it thats all totally intentional
these field goals are killing me total yards edge and 2 turnovers we should be up a lot more than 13
it cant just be the loss of yanda somebody on that offensive line has regressed
tucker just tucking it in
ngl im scared lamars gonna get hurt if they dont fucking block for him lamar getting hurt could potentially end the season
orlando brown looked good playing next to yanda last year but now holy shit
we arent used to winning and it not being close in all honesty the team needs to overcome and pull through games like this this is what sharpens our blades
i hate looking in this sub and everyone being so negative when we are up two possessions
mcphee almost blew that up
watson just fucking go down jesus christ
lol there were so many humans in that pile
our front 7 is going to wreak havoc against a less athletic qb
anthony averett not anthony everett
averett jesus christ do your job
get averett out of there bruh
averett suuuucks
averett shows up just to get fucked next play
averett is a horrible football player
averett is pain
what ever happened to iman marshall has he been injured
dog pile
do we have any other corners aside from averette who could sub for him
this drive is giving me agita
guess ill take it this team kinda playing like butt and drain the quarter for 3
can someone explain to me why bernard pollard hates harbaugh link
im ready for one of the cbs off the practice squad averett has been trash since we drafted him
we jumped boo
prince amukamura is a fa

yeah hes too good to be a fourth corner though
oh look now they have a manageable 3rd down
lol who laughed there
great job d
good stop
houston out here trying to throw on humphrey good way to not score touchdowns
long td drive please even a long fg drive would be nice
still pissed off they replaced jake from state farm into a handsome and fit man i miss the old one
we need a long fucking drive like its nobodys business
jackson is so entertaining to watch
slippery like a rain drop
she is so fine
slippery as a raindrop


i need a houdini play
did not know bout andrews diabetes huh thats crazy
jj chillplz
jj watt is not a human being
lowkey forgot how good jj swat is lol
lets go
lets go
fucking ingram
i fucking love this team
what a call g ro
the ravens are my favorite team
bruh my jaw is on the fucking floor lmao holy shit
was that a direct snap to ingram
best blocking all day what a time for it to come

big truzzzzzzzz
ingrammmmmm what a play god damn that was sexy
20 baby
what did that net do to you ingram
gro is a handsome husky genius
yes sirrrrrrrrrrrrrr
what a clean run jesus gotta love ingram
meet me outside the bankwhen we get back
damn jake from state farm buff af
bob so mad he took the mask off
still 10 mins to play lets get a to
texans are known for having a bad oline and we have given watson lots of time
watching the ravens play prevent towards the end of games always infuriates me its so bad
block the fg plzz
deshon desean

i traded sammy watkins to my buddy for hollywood like 20 mins before kickoff and now watkins is hurt holy fuck i just got that one off
props to faribairn for also staying clear of the illness affecting nearly all kickers this year and being pretty money for his team today


bruce lee
damn easy on my qb fucker
clock killing td drive here we go
god i love football
we going

good thing the refs couldnt see that blatant hold from andrews
not a bad challenge gives them a to to go over 4th and 1
knee wasnt down
good challenge if dont get it its basically a to
he got it
how the heck didnt they spot that as a 1st lol
god we are lucky
yup houstons done
gus fucking ramming them
time to load up the gus bus
tha wheels on tha bus go round and round
gus bus ride the man
i know these are garbage time yards but i love edwards
damn gus showing off

gus bus taking us to w street
gus lives for the 4th quarter
blacklock dude is lucky he has an l in there
they just ejected blacklock
imagine having like 5 guys we trust to run the ball amazing

this fucking team guys
member back in the first quarter omfg were gunna lose


gus 79 ypc edwards
can they stop going out of bounds
ok so it was a 5 minute drive with a fg still works
wasted a minute dumbass outside runs there
another week it feels good to be a raven
i like the implications
pick 6 coming up
houston sports fans all collectively gathered outside the stadium as you can hear the boos
rgiii time
so whos our player of the game the whole team felt like a collective effort
its rg3 time again lmao
that will just about do it yeah
j k all day
oh yeah dobbins is gonna be nice

holy shit jk
im so fucking hungry for next monday
who screaming get down
ride em dobbins
dobbins is a great open field runner the turf monster almost got him there but he was crazy in college
pray that greg roman doesnt try and fancy it up
lamar looks a half step slower since he bulked up overall probably a good thing but we may not see another bengals type play
ray rice
watson a bitch begging for flags like that
hey jk maybe block somebody
listen i had a really hard week im gonna need you guys to chill with the doom and gloom unless were down 20 points in the last 2 mins of the fourth
looks like were feeling the loss of yanda
seriously pass defense wake up
71 was way up field on that is he eligible
poor tavon young is made of glass
brown won on that route gotta give him a chance
fruit punch
whats the point of having ingram if we dont use him cant just deep ball everything
got the best cb duo but also the worst cb in the league to balance it out
why add time this is rigged af
pass interference 100
refs robbed us of 7 wtfff
danny lee jesus d j fluker please
dont get me wrong i love our usual offense but this type of offense hits different
lets fucking go boys and girls
dobbins is new but he should of got that block for lamar coulda been a 1st
tavon just cant stay healthy
that dude is fragile as fuck jesus
stupid drive but points
ok the missed tackles were probably just martindale playing 4d chess for good field position
anyone else think this defense could be historically good
complete to tucker
we need to run the ball
was that a catch
oline keeping the texans in the game
opening gameplay was bad this game texans got rocked by the chiefs run game we came out passing the biggest downfall of this team is game planning and play calling same shit happened last season
nice to see the refs only robbed us of 4 points instead of 7
we keep scoring and have no turnovers and everyone is screaming at our offense
should have kept carr
lets go offense lets put a nice drive together
why are we running outside the tackles right now running out the clock is far more important than scoring
run the score up
bob paid the refs smh
damn refs hate you guys too must be an afc north thing
i know were winning but there is plenty to improve on right now

lamar had an open run lane for a first but instead threw it offtarget to hollywood in the end zone lamar in general is accurate today but his pocket presence is off

line is trash both offense and defense

offensive playcalling is offrhythm no dobbins little andrews extremely poorly done chance at end of half to capitalize on peterss pick

we better come out with a fire under us
if they dont go for it theyre throwing in the towel
im more worried about staying healthy that i am winning this one i mean i want the dub but want everyone to finish the game healthy even more these 1pm games have been brutal with some huge injuries
unrelated but can someone explain the bills hype to me they had the easiest schedule ever last year and this year theyve scraped by the jets and are losing to the dolphins theyre a slightly above average team at best
aww denver finding a way to screw it up
fucking denver
okay rsvens time to reclaim first place
me before the season denver with the help of talented rookies such as jerry jeudy and with drew lock as qb will be a legit contender for the playoffs


me now
ok can we just end this trash pittsburgh game and get to our coverage
hell yeah contractual obligations
im so afraid of todays match and not because of the match up but because of all the injuries around the league like people dropping all over the place smh
i love being in the zone for the game this week and not having to jump through ten hoops to watch the game
how are yall watching the game any streaming services
it is really good to hear kevin harlan
purple and white is such a sexy combo
in other news herbert is starting
here we go
hey do you guys think mark andrews will be a raven long term to buy or not buy a jersey
good 3 and out there
3 and out baby
imagine punting on 4th 1
we suck at sweeps
lets fucking go
get a turnover and get that momentum going
alright we can just start the game for real now
time to wake up guys
cmonnnn tavon down nooooo
and hes gone again


at least hes walking
oh no another injury
oh tavon
fuck tavon young hurt again
oof that definitely popped out slightly
call ed reed i know hes bored and not doing anything right now for old times sake ed
dude if he is injured again idk how we can keep him next year
knee sprain lets hope be strong tavon
tavon young is injured again god fucking damnit this guy is so frustrating to root for
maybe tavon will be ok
ok ill admit it through 1 game plus a quarter i was wrong about queen dude is a stud and i cant wait to see him develop
yas queen
queen kept fighting
dt brandon williams is dressed but backup justin ellis started the drive and just went out for derek wolfe something to watch jonasshaffer
anyway i can watch the game without getting dmca notice my mom got one for last weeks game and it freaked her out lol
where was the protection i like jj watt except now
who remembers 2013 when we were literally ecstatic for first downs
terrible play
that guy with cleats same color as the ball got me excited for no reason
lol are we gonna run the ball
i hate the head to head flag but how was that not a penalty
nice block by boykin
guys we will adjust remember last year when we played them
run the ball
guys its the first quarter calm down
that was a good throw
fuck it throw it to andrews every play no one can stop him
lol he did not need to hurdle at all though just go around
the cbs broadcast is fuckin awful we keep missing the start of plays
where tf is our oline
boykin again
looks like boykin might have a day
alrighty i am scared as shit
big first down
were rolling now
dobbins ingram gus
the way lamar throws is art
well at least doubtful means its probally a knee sprain and hell be back at some point
we dont run the ball anymore apparently
o line give lamar a second plz
pound the rock
i get so worried when lamar runs lol i feel like his mother
lamar i iove you
roby is out there headhunting wtf every single tackle hes going headfirst like shazier
holy fuck free rusher on every play
why is hollywood in the backfield
got tipped i think

take your points brick by brick
jesus fuck

just a nice job my deshaun hes a more likeable big ben
i miss suggs
its one thing to get outran by watson but to get stiffarmed by him come on lol
ravens d just got lamard
gotta be honest that was impressive
hes greased up with oil and butter
gotta get him down but honestly that kind of pressure no matter how experienced watson is has to rattle him on some level
cant believe he wasnt whistled down i think ward let go
queen is the smart one and not going for the kill to make him throw it out
how tf did we let him go lmao
fuck lmao watson is legit
gotta stop this here
fuck off the field fuckers
lol i love our guys but he made us look silly there
bruh did they just call elliot a corner
any known streams for the out of towners
i get watson is slippery but damn dude tackle the man you practice against lamar
big oof
what call was that
bob things
fuck yeah
bill obrien gonna bill obrien
d is playing their asses off we arent sacking but the pressure is for sure getting there dbs doing the damn thang too
and this is when we pile on that was a mistake
wasnt queen i dont think
fucking bowser got thrown like a toddler that is not how you get the big money extension
what in the fuck was that call i mean go ravens but damn so dumb
wink def knew they were gonna go for it and took the timeout
great screen play
nice set up on the screen
lamar is throwing darts
interesting to see if dobbins gets the touch here at the 1

edit gus bus
man i thought he was gonna get there
boyle looked so dejected that he didnt get in
touchdown ricard
ricard making up for last week
touchdown ravens

just run the ball
solid drive lamar throwing lasers

what a catch damn son
thank you bob
richard is dat boi
damn akins a big dude
come on defense work hard to get lamar the ball back
wake me up when the playoffs start this scrub watson wont be there
a moving presnap defense will typically be a good one add the talent in and youve got a great defense
whose the person out there responsible for coming up with m words to rhyme
where tf was marlon running
llama looks sad

ffs you gotta get ahead of that throw they just got 36 yds
wake up d
come on lets get a to
this is bullshit
fells is killing us
ugh no thnk u
okay yea that definitely shouldve been an ineligible man downfield
defense forgot how to defense
i miss tavon already
baker belongs in a book club
levine out of his depth back to back he should only be a special teams player
mark andrews time
can anyone comment on how the chiefs are looking
was that duvernays first career catch
jackson is such a pimp
who gets ball at halftime
looks like this year lamar is going to be much more of a passer than runner

more practical but not going to lie im going to miss the nutty rushing attack
coaching adjustment lamar doesnt always have his mouth guard in when hes handing it off defense can easily key on that

nice catch tuck
we need some trick plays to get tucker in at wr


s odviously

lol justin tucker the legend



massive first down we need a touchdown here
i get the feeling they wanted ingram as the vet to be the primary ball carrier against a texans d line led by watt and out for some revenge from last year
am i the only one noticing mark ingram being open asf on those fake runs where he goes short to the side like why not even try that
fun fact i still have to mute the tv when jt kicks i know hes mr automatic but im still scarred for life from hauschka sp and cundiff
lol fox for cardswft just called watson vs jackson an nfc showdown
i dont understand why dobbins hasnt been in more he looked good last week i hope they get him involved in the second half
fuck i love marlon hes always forcing fumbles
harbs had the red flag in his hand challenge coming up
oh lort lj fort
fruit punch
marlon humprey perfected the peanut punch
of course it was humphrey who punched it out
punch master marlo
hold that ball tight when humphrey is around
looked like he got in
holy shit
snowball is about to get extra snacks tonight
aaaaand hes short by a yard damn kevin
whats under review to see if its a touchdown

yo that wendys pretzel burger looks sus
can someone explain the fruit punch to me apparently i missed a meme
blanket fort
ok everyone take a breath now we got this
more good news chiefs are getting cooked by justin herbert

building the fort in the end zone
were taking no prisoners
im glad that were getting the train going but can we just appreciate that it wasnt dan fouts that was officiating when this happened
buy von miller for the low edc
we gotta knock watson on his ass
charles tillman looks at humph highlights and probably smiles
fucking peters

allpro punch out by marlonhumphrey ravens
mp juicemannnnnnn
mp juiceman
mp juice man

mp fucking juiceman
my god is that clean

odell in shambles just got shivers down his dang spine
the defense has finally woken up haha
i might cry guys
yall thirsty have a damn juice box

what a fucking catch by mp juice man most receivers couldnt make that catch
ravens need to pay lamar
that was incredible
marcus peters is a fucking hawk
what a pick
holy shit
i wanna see hollywood in open space more
stuntin on these hoes
mp juiceman lets go out there and get a td before the half

what a fucking pick
pick 6 shawty
our defense may not be our all time best but it is fun as fuck
score here then get the ball first in the 2nd half
watson tried to break that tablet
mp juice man

hey deshaun we aint the fucking chiefs you aint throwing that shit easy on us
watts just damn good
too many sacks smh
i know its jj but obj is getting burned
qb1 is pissed at that line
jj watt is great when healthy lamar jackson is not bad for a runningback tell me something i didnt know
orlando brown is getting bullied
where is jacksons protection dang jj watt is good and handsome
jj watt is good relax guys
again wtf
fuck im filthy with our oline weak weak weak
my god this oline lmao
im cri
at least we get the ball back at half
man our ol is struggling today
lmao pathetic protection

gotta call faster routes if they cant protect lamar better than this
please stay healthy
greg roman forgot his specialty is running the ball
they are pinning their ears back need to call a screen pass or draw to ease that pressure
fucking finally
its okay to miss watson once hes crazy slippery just stay on him
if the oline showed up today wed be up like 30
wheres jimmy smith i hate having averett out there
the oline has been atrocious but god bless lamar and understanding that he cant give the ball away









bruh how we about to let watson do this and get momentum going into half
averett more like ayy catch it
anthony come on man
very nice sack
get averett outta there dude is a liability
please let that flag be on houston
theyre blitzing every play just start calling screens until they soften up
averett is not very good man
you would never guess averett is a former alabama db by looking at his play in the nfl
what the ever loving fuck was that bullshit
soits still 207 right


damn only up 10 with a fumble return td and pick
put in mekari or somebody on the line we need some stability there
we made good adjustments at the half last week lets hope we do here
why we passing so much wheres the run game
up 10 at the half despite a shakey olinerun game play and we get the ball back all is good
definitely too much passing in the first half as well we got 3 good backs gotta get them involved
fuck off refs

wtf was that call
cant show the replay because nothing happened
did they start pumping in crowd noise this half
today our kicker became a wr and one of our wrs became a te
gus bus
beep beep its the bus
the gus bus has no brakes
yall werent ready for the bus
so whats going on with dobbins doghouse injury in pregame he had gotten 0 touches
best this century
we finally seem to be getting the running game going

holy ray rice deja vu
i see ray rice
theres dobbins
way to get us a first down dobbins
he looks so much like rice
dobbins is special yall
he wasnt even looking at the ball
dobbins using that rice arm
just had a realization about our time of possession on this drive unreal
its nice having ray rice back
this drive has officially taken half the quarter

lets end it right boys
olgeez man
jesus christ line
philips is killing us at rg
no pi
oof that was close
holy shit tucker got me worried
i get we are up but this o line is really sad today
nailed it



47yd field goal for tucker
man what is up with our o line
tucker playing with us lol
phillips is fucking shit
oline is worse than dogshit
bozeman is our best lineman at the moment stanley a close second and that makes me suuuuper nervous
lamar needs to throw it to the check down it might be a difficult throw but its the only option
cmon defense step up and get the ball back
fuck yes
brought the house and it fell on watson like the wicked witch
bwill getting pressure i see you big boy
bowser has been amazing so far
watson is so good jesus
that was a good throw
averett sucks
what the fuck
we cant do better than averett god damn that mother fucker sucks
oof amazing pressure but averett not quite there
that was a fucking beautiful pass
im so sad about tavon

has hump even allowed a completion
line needs to get better at picking up their assignments

i know yanda is gone but this has been an inexcusable amount of missed blitzers
can watson not set his feet and throw anymore he does that highschool jump pass even when theres no pressure lol
i know we have a 10 pt lead but it just doesnt feel like it bc we can barely stop the pass and the o line cant pass block to save their lives and before you ask no im not a bandwagon fan from last year
we need a touchdown
houstons wr corps is allin on blazing fast 2s lol
get 6 sirs
points or bust on this drive
any news on tavon
if you ignore the fact we are up and only look at the bad plays we are playing god awful s
own td game over
is there a way we can run the clock for 1410


good job snead
nice to see the ravens having multiple receivers with decent hands
remember that flacco era game where jj watt basically singlehandedly destroyed us i cant remember the specific year
man jj watt has been an absolute beast today
i really dont care for plays to ricard
go for it
going through his reads
get em
go for it
hell yeah coach lets go for it
what a call
ingram yasssss

this fuckin team man man united and the thunder suck right now but the ravens are giving me life
chiefs about to drop an l
there goes our offense big truss wooo wooooo
not sure ive ever seen a play blocked that well
thank you thank you thank you
anyone just see that dropped pass in the kc game lol
clay matthews had 8 sacks and is still a fa edc
i feel like theres a decent amount of holding not getting called
thats what im talking about
another sack
theres the sack

joker szn
there we go deshon
finally starting to feel good about this game pls football god dont jinx us
lets eat some clock
lol kc is not taking that l
boyle gives up on blocks so fast
amazing tackle stopped a touchdown
what a freaking tackle i thought he was gone
jackson had the whole outside and ran straight into the defender
kinda disappointed that we didnt take that to the house lmao
well at least were still terrible when it comes to challenges
yo again i ask where can i get that neck gaiter harbaugh is wearing
good win obv but you gotta feel bad for the wasted talent in houston
fake punt sam koch td pass

ill buy a koch jersey immediately
i feel like stanley not having a good gameis this true
gus bus is sneaky big
i gotta say edwards looks a heck of a lot more explosive than ingram so far this year
gus the bus
i heard gus was once called the bus
damn gus bus is fucking doing it today
gus is going to get paid next year
gus bus jerome bettis
the bus lost its brakes
run up the score on them
you know whats an improvement last season lamar had trouble keeping an eye on the play clock but this year he seems to be in complete control
boze on that play tho
gus is so damn talented i hope we dont trade him
these timeouts yikes
lets see jk run it down their throat
still think gus should be our 1 i love ingram but gus is my man
jk in the doghouse for something what he do
chargers up 3
lets get lamar another passing td
lamar jackson td coming up
running out of bounds lamar hmm
also i was thinking this earlier i dont think jk quite knows the playbook yet and thats why hes not playing as much but im just guessing
props to the texans lbs theyve been keeping up with lamar for the most part
why we extending the game lol run up the middle lol
this was a gutsy win but our blocks were so loweffort
today was a good day to have tucker on your fantasy team
rg3 time
anyone else just get a big ass smile looking at lamar on the sideline
gg guys lets gooo
remember when people in here were just saying how our defensive pressure is awful

lol we really out here adding insult to injury like this
43 yards from 3rd string rb yes please
glad we came out of this game with a w and mostly healthy
this is tough for houston they havent looked that bad these last two weeks but they seem like they have no heart left two games back in the division already too
oof not gonna be able to physically watch the game next week gonna have to listen on 98 rock dont have espn anymore
lets goooo 20
lol game over
chargerschiefs likely going to ot if the chiefs dont win outright
can we make sad texans a new meme
lol he really called a punt there huh
the crowd noise in this la game is annoying like an annoying constant buzz
our oline is straight trash
if lamar made that pass his haters wouldnt shut up
tavon injured what else is new
we arent playing particularly well today guess im spoilt by our great play in the lamar era
laughably bad play calling here yes our line is bad and will offer no protection so why arent we dialing up a short pass or a draw
dobbins needs to block
another day another tavon on ir
whelp there goes tayvon young
im pretty sure tavon just ended his career i really hope im wrong
holy shit we look like ass today andrews is the only consistent player
lamar is carrying us rn lol goodness
is the field super shitty lamar keeps slipping
i know deshaun is good but you have to get a sack there embarrassing
lmao tucker
tucker is a new wr
put tucker at wr
judon is getting close though someone who told me clowney sucks cause he doesnt get sacks
now our obj is acting like a homegirl
time for fluker at rg
the next texans completetion ravens reddit is going to call for bisciotti to sell the team
amazing how these announcers really forget about the person who got this mobile qb trend started with cam
do not go for it if we dont get it
miles boykin is such a good blocker
best in the league
averett is fucking trash what the fuck was that
tavons just going to be one of those guys isnt he fuck
can we trade for jj watt at halftime
online is having a hard time yes but it seems lamar is picking the wrong of the two holes every single time which is extremely uncommon though no real blame on him considering he usually always picks the right hole
didnt get promoted buy a car

we definitely care about women amirite fellas
well that was flat
comeon rookie you got to make that block
first drive lamar scrambled during a 3 man rush he usually stays patient at that point

2nd down play reminded me of the bills game
come on matt gotta make that play
tavon is made of fucking glass man
every fucking year poor guy
mahomes playing like shit today
mahomes is 28 for 14 yards after 1 quarter i mean theyll almost certainly still win but that is pretty wild
the texans are going to gain some yardage but make no mistake there is absolutely nothing there for them right now anywhere on the field this is some vintage ravens defense so far

damn first bad pass from lamar
seriously fuck this week
fuck our oline is terrible
extremely lucky to be up by 13 now
temper tantrum
well just make the ref fumble and theyll add time for you
the defense ended the half with a penalty filled choke job think the same thing happened last week but we escaped without giving up anything
ive seen a lot of bs officiating in my life but giving time back to the opposing team so that they have enough time for a fg thats beyond ridiculous
dude was open
shit coverage by queen
why the hell was queen playing at corner
was nervously waiting for a flag there on marlon
i never watch broadcast tv except during football season damn these commercials suck even worse during an election year
imma need mandrews to go off these next 7 minutes to hel my fantasy team
that was so risky
put gus edwards in the ring of honor
props to the oline theyre winning the battle when they know whats coming
theres no reason for lamar to carry let alone go out of bounds there
take 3
run up the score plz
ferguson cant even get off a running back bro
imma be honest dont flame me fellas i think bakers commercials are funny
this play calling is trash
honestly its not spoiled or annoying for wanting to have the team mix up the plays use the running backs we have they can help
mahomes will eat this secondary alive were going to have to blitz 6 the whole game

please broncos
steelers bout to lose to a back jeff driskel
i really hope this game finishes before our game starts
at least theres no way for this game to go into ot
still not over
will the steelers play against real football teams this year besides us
man this game sucks i cant wait for lamar to put 60 on the steelers fts
broncos choking again

every time i see a score that shows the underdog making a game interesting literally within two minutes of me turning the game on they fucking tank and do something stupid
had to switch over to the washington game really cant sit through this steelers game until ours starts
ravens game day boys lets go
damn steelers always getting lucky against awful teams
im watching sunday ticket wheres the game
oh yes harlan is commentating im so happy
texans won and elected to receive they know if they give the ball to lamar to start theyve got no chance
all the homies love kevin harlan
we are off
lets go
bow shit hol up movie
did cbs fuck up and not show us the first 2 plays
nice 3 and out to start d

3 and out
hell yea jimmy
smith did his job there nice
nicely done defense
harrison is already starting wow thats crazy
i love it when teams receive first
r a v e n s


whats up my dudes couldnt watch last week so this is my kickoff today

and to make it all better its kevin harlan on the call

lets fucking go

lets go d
no tavon
jesus christ man
tavon again oh no
oh god no tavon

tavon pls
goddammit tavon
thats not ideal
oooph bad landing



that did not look good gotta feel for tavon man second year in a row what a terrible day for injuries but not a good way to start
what even happened there
what a surprise
hopefully its just a knee sprain
the falcons are having the hardest 283 flashbacks right now
fuck man was so excited to see him play this year w mp and marlo
id rather see jimmy outside now and marlon in the slot
watson does have good escapability that was nice pursuit
good pressure there and nice play by queen
good defense
good job d


finally they got him down
not a sack but ill take pressures all day everyday
hope my dude young is good wearing his jersey that i never wear too much and of course
ok shake off the last drive and get some momentum here
i like how weve already touched the qb more than we did last week
come on guys you need to have faith have faith in my bobby
lets fucking do something now
ditched my wife making halloween decorations to watch the game im in trouble but dont care
watt is just good
what the fuck offense
78 you awake
run the ducking ball
ffs we gotta protect lamar


jj is gonna be disruptive lol
andrews there we go
nice but no need for the hurtle there mandrews
helmet to helmet
handrews do be looking like white drake
those first few offensive plays were an hommage to our prelamar days
gotta love how the texans pa people accidentally made the fake crowd cheer during a big play for the ravens haha
literally zero runs lol
have we ran the ball at all yet
the o line is looking like an issue early
big boy boykin
good play boykin
god the people in this fucking game thread man you would think we would be down 21 by the way people are talking
hell yea myles
offensive line needs to wake up
lets go miles
run the bal
yes boykin nice slant
how bout our runningbacks take some carries
has anyone seen our o line
the oline looks awful whats going on
there he is
now this looks like the ravens offense
is stunting happening
oof that injury report does not sound good
we rollin now boys dont forget the texans are still a good team
is tavon done for the year again that would be devastating for him
they aint running the ball cause our interior line had some trouble against cleveland last week how yall think they will do better against the texans dline who is 10x better than cleveland
ravens cornerback tavon young knee doubtful to return aaronwilsonnfl
damn it need young
lamars doing a good job avoiding injuries so far
oline has been hot shit lamar keeping the drive alive every play
both tackles seem confused
nice route by boykin
lamar such an escape artist
finally seems like the o is getting a rhythm but itd be nice to get the backs involved
what a run
shame lamar got caught there they faked out watt real good
i like the 3 definitely wanna see more running plays to our rbs though cant complain about the drive though d is holding it tf down
both defenses came to play today
tackle and damn watson is strong
damn dude i hate those plays lol
dang is ds greased up

sneaky watson
credit to our secondary for holding it down through that 3rd down
are you serious ward
we have to finish these tackles guys
sack that mf goddamnit
bruh the play clock was on 2 just let it run out
watson is really good at breaking tackles
watson just too strong lol
so this is what other teams feel
fuck yeah
want that face covering harbs has anyone know if its for sale

thank you very much
horrible call by texans
lets gooooooooo
thats embarrassing
aw yiss motherfucking pressure



get your fucking weak shit outta here
lets get a td here

oh yeah i like that
ingram took a hell of a shot and didnt even flinch
havent seen a screen in years
goes for it on 4th down in their own territory and doesnt get the first

the connection to your peer has been lost
reminder we were only up by one score at the end of the first quarter of last years texans game then we feasted
wasnt our score something like this after q1 against texans last year
that was a strange move by bob no fans low energy 30 game you just manufactured energy for the ravens man
dunn is a big boy
bozeman block was fire
bob is glad he has a mask on to hide his red ass face rn
i have it on good authority that greg roman read all of your complaints tyfys
yasss screen
boyle just cant buy a td
omg boyle almost
i thought thats was 6 for sure
ill fucking take it
gotta lead him just little more llama lol
we jivin now
im happy to see hayden succeed today but were still good without him

good work patty

ill take it lol
nice job ric
juiceman pick 6 plz

i say texans you say fuck em texans
whats the rule again for blocking kicks seemed like a lot of texans lined up on one side
anyone from az know why our cbs isnt showing games today its three hours of paid programming in place of the game lol
come on d
pass rush needed desperately
seeing lineman just standing around as a play ends give me war flashbacks to middle school and i love it

oof marlon abandoned the te was he expecting help
whos man
double awful yuck


alright get one back


lets go
its really disappointing that ferguson or bowser arent starters at deolb yet we need a serious upgrade in those positions
ibm watson hahahahahaha
need a touchdown drive here

texans are a good team watt is back and were in their house after blowing them out in ours last time
marlon tried to pull a peters and jump the outside route ended up handing fells a first down
levine showing why he stays on special teams still after this whole time
lamar is sharp

lamars throws just look so much more crisp this year


love devin
beautiful throw
wheres jk
how come our fake hand offs look a lot more fake this season
interesting that were not trusting them deep yet
yeah man its not as easy for us to run to the right without yanda
jk time
lol tuck
i fucking love this team


thats an easy 26 yards
hollywood always seems so close to turning those jets on


tucker is automatic
ill take those points thank you very much
i wish we were running as much as we were play actioning
now this might be hard for you all to understand but jk might not be a good matchup against this d line also hell be much fresher later when the d is tired
yess i started dst
i just creamed
just when yall were losing truss
hell yeah lets punch this one in
i think hes in
humphrey the hammer
i liked that
that fucking punch
marlo is that motherfucker
thanks for the ball houston
fruit punch
humps got that peanut punch in his bag
lets gooooo also how the hell did they miss that hold on judon
lj fort
oh come on ref give him that td
thats a td baby
letsss fuckkiiiinn goooo
hell yeah im wearing my humphrey jersey today too
fuck yea
are you fucking kidding me
fort td lets go fort
lets go
wow i didnt realize fort fumbled that after the score almost pulled a mosley
hollywood was gonna let deshaun eat shit into the bench lmao
holy shit mp juicemannnn
what a grab by peters
fucking peters
great catch
that shit was beautiful
what an int
holy shit that pick
what a fucking catch
you love to see it
that was a beautiful catch by peters

that was an incredible dive
mp juice man
i love our secondary
mp juice man
now we gotta game goin
announcer should know it doesnt matter if it touches the ground as long as hes in control of it when it does
fuck he could have been a wr lol
lets fucking go
im just picking up on it
whats up with the lack of deep play attempts is it because of the amount of pressure lamar is under
can we get some fucking protection for lamar please
jimmys turn please
watts still got it dang

can we actually protect lamar
watson looks like he wants to end it all lmao
why arent we running the ball
were making the plays but the texans are manhandling some guys out there a lot more physical

rare bad play
he looks ok
holy shit bad goes to worse
not stanleyagain
please be okay stanley we need you
no reason to call such a play on offense you know our o line cant hang on for more than a few seconds so theres very little chance our wrs can run a longer route need quick hits not long slow developing pass plays come on
stanley doesnt look too distraught
alright defense no points lets go to the half
roman needs to play all to their strengths gun the whole game
wouldnt a pick 6 be fun here
terribly managed drive there that was a chance to really put the texans up against it
such a weird game
anyone got any oline players for a 5th rounder
this new overly pass happy play calling along with our struggling ol is really pissing me off now
oh yeah we can get sacks too baby
shocked that we were actually able to tackle watson there
theres the sack we needed

bowser deserves a contract extension over judon so far
i got excited for a sack but nvvm
judon needs to break down and tackle he keeps diving and wiffing
bs call

averette is bbq chicken
ofc a convenient penalty
can we fucking tackle jesus christ
defense shitting the bed now
home game clock operator is friendly
nice referee escort on this drive
okay ref what are you seeing
whats the noise i hear in the broadcast i thought they werent pumping crowd noise at the stadium
put jimmy on the outside man this is why we signed him
we just rushed 2 wtf
we need to chill tf out
what in tarnation
we adjust and get the ball back next half were still up two scores people
as long as the line play is cleaned up next half we should be fine
6 point swing cause of that sack oh well still in good position
this is defensive battle imo neither of our lines are holding up
chest pain wtf is that lol
not apart of the local market and the cbs game for my area is the chiefs game fuck me i guess

how is the game so far
what is pollards beef
damn that washingtoncardinals game is speeding theyre already 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter
we knew oline would not be the same without yanda
stanley is hurt and looks like it and brown jr is getting embarrassed by watt we need to do something
omg bullshit flag

great job boykin
boykin te
boykin the tight end
wait boykin is a tight end
boykin just chilling where he needed to inbetween
did boykin play te in college
there is a reason they keep calling pass they arent able to get enough push on oline
gus bus
where is dobbins
nice run gus
lets get the bus chugging baby
tha wheels on tha bus go round and round
the gus bus rolls
da busss
love boykin
gus bus lets get that run game going
lamar has been deadly with his voice today
now we running
dobbins might not be a strong blocker yet
keep gus in over mark rn if were just gonna act like jk doesnt exist lol
gus is a beast for bit dls

even if jk is an everydown back i love rotating power and speed backs
i love seeing gus getting physical

that was some terrible blocking lol

jk rolling
dobbins you fucking stallion
i like that dobbins
love that second effort by dobbins
dobbins giving me ray rice flashbacks

get jkd
looked like ray rice
dobbins has received a target from his coach dobbins is a free rb
amazing play by dobbins
dobbins fresh in the second half lets get it
jk had has the hand like ray
orlando brown i love you man but you are getting eaten alive against watt today
fucking oline
ugh oline
obj is getting worked
i want to see an option play with llama dobbins bus ingram and fuck it why not rg3
can our ol block
where is our oline today texans d is not good yet we are getting manhandled
really not liking our oline play
kinda fucked up that you cant challenge a nocall
damn you could see the shadow of the ball on the goal post as it passed hard to get closer than that without hitting still the goat
man i miss yanda his presence made the two guys next to him better and its showing these first two games
dont think phillips was as ready as harbs thought he was skura is playing slightly scared it looks like which is to be expected coming off such a serious injury bozemen has held up decently though
start fluker and start dobbins
lamar ran straight into that sack phillips picked up the stunt pretty well tbh still unsure about him but that one wasnt a miss
come on d make a play we need yall
eww ray look creepy af in that pic lol
13 pt lead not bad
come on defense tighten up
there we go

big baby
that tackle holy cow
nice tackle averette
thank god we sacked him cooks was wide open

yeah both of these olines are trash today
23 powned
what the hell did watson do to piss off his own center this much
jesus christ deshaun is a beast

that was a great play god damn
nvm lol
how did that throw arrive
come on man
i thought that one was pi
this ad is worse than the champ is here very 2020
we need to rally back on offense next drive go down field take time off and score a td field goals will win it but we want to win with confidence
stills smiling at humphrey like he even came close to catching it
need a stop here defense needs to show some fire
goddamn it calais
nice hold
we drained 15 minutes of game and kept the margin 10

i consider this an absolute win

this is the way
run the ball convert with mandrews on third get it done letssssss gooooooo
that right there helping up the opponent is what makes lamar jackson an awesome human
willie pinballing through the d

slippery as a rain drop
watt is definitely showing up today
im so conflicted these are two great plays but they are moving down the field faster than my fatass when its meal time
i want 2 td passes by lamar
gus is freaking unstoppable
fuck it go for it
damn i wish we had a big physical wr like boldin used to be
omg yes
mark ingram or lamar jackson i cant tell
and this too is the way


what a play call
lets goooooooo dagger
lets fucking gooooo
god i love mark ingram
no lio boi
fuck yeah
i was questioning not getting 3 there but lol me that was awesome
30 yardz baby biggg truzzzzzz
thats ball game big boi
mark mf ingram
hahaha fuck yes ingram still got it



drink to that my brothers we can relax now
what a call thank the football gods it worked or it wouldve been a terrible call am i right boys
der d
holy shit one of our lineman got their ass handed to them on that last play
make em work for it d nothing fast
ughhhhhh this what yall dont need
is it me or is ward getting no push on that left side
elliot is the enforcer out there
cmon defense game aint over yet
not sure if texans looking good on offense or our defense not on point
i hate this prevent d were playing
that was actually a really good route by cobb
is tht a humphrey sack

deshon szn
im glad were getting to play a game this physical and seemingly close defense needs to fight through the rest of this quarter
lets get that score go ravens
i really enjoyed the ingram td with lamar at wr and a rb at qb
ah here comes the pat mahomes comeback
i need some gus in the 4th quarter

how is mahomes so good
chiefs looking at our game so they gotta come back lol
great stuff that ingram run was chefs kiss
that would have been six if it wasnt for that tackle
is jah reid available
damn mahomes that was a crazy pass
just no reason for designed lamar runs in the fourth quarter up 14
thats a first wtf refs
go for it
saved the touchdown


fuckin mark needs to finish that block
send it

big truss here on this call
i havent been watching but i assume herberts been balling
if it ends up being short i dont think its a good idea to go for it even though weve been very successful in the past
lets go for it coach
challenges make me anxious

was that ball game
wft coming back a little
gus is so fucking good
this dudes got balls the size of texas
kc roughs the passer on a 3rd down play where it was an incomplete pass
wind that clock
is ingram not fit to play
they have hardly played dobbins today
guys the bus
boykin blocking downfield is awesome kid is the unsung hero of this run game
gus bus
gus for mvp
chill edwards i can only get so hard
fuck it lets see a strike into the endzone here brown or andrews

was that 90s second
did the chargers bench tyrod for herbert
gimmie another lamar td for fantasy purposes would prefer rushing but will settle for passing im not fussy
somebody stay in bounds


ugh thats kevin harlin hes totally obsessed with me
fuck it play action lamar to hollywood touchdown

s kind of
texans quit on themselves
somehow chargers let mahomes scramble for 21 when they needed 20
good job team
tavon young likely out for season
few bad plays and we trash again gtfo fake ass fans
oline needs to get their shit together man we should be up 27 or 237
guys its one bad drive reeeelax
and tavon might have torn his acl again another sacrifice to this bloody sunday in the nfl
not sure why weve completely abandoned the run ingram and dobbins just not getting any touches on two drives already
trash ass offensive line
blatant fixing by the refs there
rgiii has the best smile
i dont think people realise how good texans d is we cant be super human all the time
i told you guys oline was gonna struggle those of you who downvoted me owe me money
just bench lamar too risky to play him this week everyones going down
pls run the ball
trash first drive
some guys just have awful luck plays in 2nd game since 2018 gets injured again and it doesnt look good
young injured again big fuckin surprise
dude andrews needs to stop jumping
just protect the ball pls lamar
might want to consider shuffling up the oline looks terrible
texans are such a dangerous team glad we took the points there but dang a td wouldve felt great there
we left our tackling at home
thanks bob
not looking great
elliot looks slow there
where are our corners this should be an easy strap up man coverage kind of day by marcus marlo and jimmy
im really starting to hate the fake crowd noise about as much as i do laugh tracks on network sitcoms
lamar cant throw


hot take duv is going to be our next jacoby
nice catch by tucker
nice pass to tuck
put tucker in hell get a td
i feel like the offense is being too cute rn
two possession game after the refs gifting them 3 lmao keep helping them refs they need it
hope our oline shows up for the second half
yall need to settle down lol the world isnt going to explode if we dont score 3 touchdowns per quarter
everyone is blaming the ol for that sack that sack isnt the ols fault
theyre just driving up and down the field smh
this game is far from over especially if they stay uptempo and we play prevent or some nonsense
excellent block by bozeman
go for it
run the fucking score up fuck rg3 lol
i hate when lamar takes knees because it hurts his rushing stats dudes gonna take like 50 knees this year and his ypc average will drop a bunch
why was queen outside guarding 1 on 1 like that
i honestly expected more from us big ups to the texans for making us earn it
greg roman you dumbass you need to run kill clock and hit the field goal but no you wasted the turnover and now stanley is injured

man we could see the makings of a bad oline in the browns game but now its really hurting us against a bad team
im glad the refs can just give free timeouts whenever they want

nfl hates us cause we love our players and support blm
yall always gotta complain about something huh
unpopular opinion but i get a lot of entertainment from some of the content on tiktok ill be sad to see it go
i could care less what they did before the game i dont need a kneeling update every week on what the team did and what anthems they did or did not stand for
ugh 4th down
the interior oline is still weak i see
dammit tavon young just cant stay healthy
he can never stay healthy
tavon and injuries man
well we resigned jimmy smith to a one year prove it kind of veteran deal and he yet again cant make the field


correct me if im wrong but i think averrett is in instead
another year our return game doesnt exist lmao
why sre they trying to kill lamar call a fucking run
the o line has regressed so much what a damn shame
llama gonna run out of energy by the 2nd quarter run the damn ball
ready for dubs for both my ravens and lakers today
im sad i have to miss the cards and chiefs game because im focusing on ours but at the same time we the best so am i really missing out
i dont hate mahomes i really like him but i do hope he lays an egg in his game because why on earth is this not the national game
tucker with the godly catch
marlon punchfree
this is why you run the ball to freeze their ends and give yourself 3rd and shorts the play calling hasnt been good this game has been all our defence our only td came on a 30 yard field the offence needs to establish the run idk why we keep passing on 1st and have given dobbins 0 carries last time we abandoned the run like this was the playoff game
there are going to be problems if they bring this play to pittsburgh
we dont need yanda its week 2 chill
refs trying to bail out the texans and make this a game
weve played very sloppy and still are up 207 we need to wake up now
learn to wear a mask you fucking ancient zebra cunt
any way we can realistically improve our pass rush this season like who we can trade for or something
not sure how you make that play with him shoving you like that blatant pi
you guys are new to lamar jackson if you think this o line punishment is new to him all that chaos is way too familiar to him
averett with a good play
if young is out for a while we really should trade to get someone other than everrett
cant have those mistakes right now make a play d
awful throw
not good for lamar stay inbounds
man do we have the best 123 rb lineup in the league or what
the gus buss gas mileagebattery range just went up
the bus is just working them right now
gus buschoo choo motherfuckers
where was andrews all game wtf

bad start for the offense
ugh we need ronnie stanley

i love boykins block there how come we havent ran the ball a single time except for the sweep running backs
uh run the ball bb
oline looks baaaaaad so far
roman you are really confusing me here
wow what a throw also olinehow about a second or two
did not like that landing from mandrews me no like helmet hitting ground hard
isnt lonnie johnson the guy who misspelled his name on his sat
mandrews nice block by boykin too
are we just passing vs afc south teams or what
beautiful run by lamar there
lamar nice
finally a decent run
cool cool i think they just needed a series to remember that not every team is the the browns
boykin has much improved
fuck youngs done for the day probably
ravens marching
yes slants to big body receiver finally
fuuuuck poor tavon
t young knee problemno dah
well crap young likely done for the day
fuck we need tavon
classic lamar right there love it
gus almost plowed through that tackle
tavon young best nickel cb in the league for 1 game you get out of him a year
llama is showing off
yes but slide feet first lamar
omg lamar is so fucking good
hold my breath every time he goes face first
a cleanse of pallet after watching my man burrow try to be lamar lol
lamar is good
love gus even on 3 yard runs
good drive by the offense the defense is getting some good rest with this drive
3 in a row
no one went to pick up lamar
lamar fast
any decent slot corners available losing tavons a big blow to our depth
broken ankles
cunningham is pretty good it seems
i miss yanda
hollywood wants nothin to do with watt lol
go for it

we dont seem to be using the fake handoff look that we used a lot last year
a lot of new fans were not here when every game was within 3 and came down to the last play i see lmaoooo
houston would have 7 on the board of we had just picked baker up in the draft shit
its early in the season they are showing some looks for upcoming teams to study
defense make a play
everybody dont care anything else but please stay healthy until the chiefs game
how is lamar so young
run d looks good
but yeah let jkingram run a little
stuff these fuckers get um off the field
least we forced the 4th no 1st down but jeeeeeeezz we need better rush
i know tackling deshaun isnt easy but that was awful
really suprised that wasnt blown dead
when did the texans pick up russell wilson
shit i was so stress lucky he got out so many tackles he shouldve thrown it away like 20 times that play
fucking make the tackle

hell yeah

lol watson had no chance
big oof
bill obrien wow
who had the qb pressure
trust bob to make a horrible decision
lets go boys
unrelated but where can i get that neck gaiter that harbaughs wearing
im gonna need two tds to hollywood for my fantasy team
i know nobody cares about fantasy but i just traded watkins for hollywood minutes before kick off im stoked
bob is gonna bob
theres my ingram
angry ingram
texans had a mini bye everyone chill
jk dobbins td incoming
this is a nice drive
ram this one in like its jenna jameson
theres ingram
lamars a gunslinger

hot damn
alright d lets get it
d just punked em hard forced the to
why did the texans decide not to pump crowd noise
wide open
too much time

just like that
false start

fells eating our lunch
burn the clock and get the ball back next half and double up on scores
those passes to the te who is so much bigger than our dbsreally hard to stop even with perfect coverage dunno what you are even supposed to do there
pls respond rn offense were fortunate that bob is an idiot


damn first flag clean game
lets get it

jacksons ability to turn an aggressive blitz against them is just fun to watch
yes need more ingram
we got this
move those chains move those chains move those chains huaa
oh boy
tuck with the catch goat
that was harder than it needed to be
lamar and the receivers are playing great
lot of open receivers down the field
man he juuuuuust barely got hollywood



tucker is so damn good
that show actually looks good to me
great special teams play by board
where the hell is jk dobbins today
this is a good game to get out if sync texans are really good and if we can grind this out it might show some of our coaches and players our deficiencies before the game vs chiefs
and just like that we run away with it
lets fucking go defense
and thats how you get back d
fucking cowards give my man his pick 6
fumble td lets fucking go
long texans drive here for a td to end the half would be bad lets get hype for the first time this game defense
just thought to myself we could use a fumble

fruit punch is in season

please let this stand
falcon punch
you love to see it
marloooo lets gooo
hey thats a touchdown
lets gooo
our defence just played right
he aint even step out
marvin for defensive mvp

nothing to review here ravens ball
thats a td right looked good to me
he made a football move after catch the ball its a fumble
marlon is gonna get his bread soon

i called it

ahhhhh yeahhhh
lets go
big willy
lets do it again
if tavon is out do we sign tj
herbert winning against mahomes lamar best qb mvp
fuuuck yes
cant let them score here need to go for the throat early

lets fucking goo
watson slightly overrated hmmm
end it here
no one even close to open
guys when did ed reed come back wearing 24
watt is just fucking terrorizing is god damn
got damn o line
jj owns our line when we play in nrg
brown kinda stopped onn watt a little early
need to get obj some boyle help
brown gotta move his feet there
fg target line is that corrected for tucker
lets get enough for at least a fg
i like a td here but if we only get 5 yards and a fg im happy
its jj watt dude is a fucking beast not surprised
oh god
i mean shit o line
man o line is getting torched

can we not
dont ruin our chance to see tucker kick a really long fg its not fair jj
whats with all the pass plays
damn why yanda
god damnit
dobbins missed that block
bro our oline nooo

he looks fine
ronnie pls be okay

we love you ya big bear
not that the online has been stellar but that was an all out blitz
ronnie stanleys ankle again
no points for them cmon stop them here
offense hasnt felt as dominant on the texans side of the field as id like to see
all these people crying about these sacks but lamar aint drop the ball most qbs would have dropped that ball
these tes are killing us
finally a sack
looks like the texans woke up
cmon defense
obviously im not a coach but if theyre rushing the linebackers and we have very fast wr why dont we run them down the middle
i hope stanley is okay

instead of clock running out now it stops

averrett is trash i dont want anyone to convince me otherwise
int calling it by clark
averett is a fast frank walker
okay didnt see the ref kick it ill allow it
thats fucking crazy
still blame the lack of a rush
bull shit
skura is just a shadow of his former self absurd to play him in the condition he is in
just saw a local political commercial that was literally this but with wrestling techniques instead of guns so so dumb

great protection there
wow the line held up lol
lamar had time he needs more
cunningham is everywhere
roman run the damn ball
hey guys a run
gus the bus
he really do be looking like a bus sometimes
ok as much as ive been loving seeing jacksons upgraded passing abilities its nice to see some running too
this is why we should be running
honk honk
the bus is rolling
gus running mfs over
the gus bus stops for no one
if there werent other guys around gus would have 100 broken that tackle on his previous run
ingram might not be as fast as he used to but he still runs hard
played wr at notre dame
always forget how explosive gus is
gus should get ever 2 yards to gain even time
look at that stat fuckin beautiful

these ravens are something special
lamar doing work with the snap count
ill take that
hollywood deep
lamar tapping into that bradyrodgers energy get those free yards make them think twice about jumping the snap count
gus doesnt get enough recognition man


lamar making espn highlight reels
are you all happy you got your planned run with lamar now
jk is in
keep him in you fucks
good job dobbins
i love that from jk
damn i cant believe he stayed up for that
fucking right dobbins

thats some rice shit right there
sick tackle break jk
atta boy dobs
nice fucking play dobbins
way to stay on your feet jk
nice job
dobbins making plays
oof lamar
lets go jk
feed jk
what offense are we running air coryell
im not looking these called qb runs havent worked well but once
finally got dobbins involved
good shit jk

jk out here turning cbs into fools
jk lol
what a catch and run
is something wrong with ingram
jk but we aint joking
exactly what im talking about no way we let gus go with jk perfect 12 punch
reminded me of another 27 with that
when our run game is working we are almost unstoppable
that was a money throw

need a td to hollywood here
dobbins is so fucking good
mckinney turned pretty freaking late on that one
jesus fucking christ online is total shit today
gimme 3

i want an oline plz
wheres the line

line looks fucking awful
god damn this oline sucks
whew close one there tuck
shew that was close good time eating drive and points at least
is ronnie playing or is he still on ir
bruh its 2020 why is james harrison in commercials
our line looks a bit slow processing stunts hopefully it improves as the rook gains experience and these guys get more playing time together
queen go zoom
our running game hasnt looked good that last two weeks
mcphee looked 24 there
he down
how tf does phee still play songs hard
watching the ticker 49ers lost a few players today eh jesus
ah fuck
oh boy
we need to get this oline together and need an actual pass rusher with some speed

1 offense td feels bad hope we can get one more and sure up the game
calais noooo

we finally stopped their offense
yesss baby yoda
ok that was the handoff deception ive been missing so far
be careful mark
thays mah boy

hell yeah in fg range
lol everyone thought washington was gonna be good this year
here we go long clock burning td drive
i love this announcer lol

perfect qbs draw and quick slant to snead thats how to slow down the rush
i hate when they say shit that jinx us dont talk about the damn no turnovers
dobbins wide open on the dump off
line is really struggling with those interior stunts
thats what you get when you dont wrap up for literally no reason
go for it
oof he needed a few big macs for that

5 wides go for it
fucking right
fortune favors the bold
wow what a play call
the big fella
wildcatttttttt babyyyyy
blackjack 21
thats how you block
lmao wow

the road to 20
hell yeah lets go for it coach
hit that bull ingram

lmao lets fucking go
big boi shit
lets go mark
poor giants
alright d please no points

cmon d
come on defense dont do that
marlon humphrey a slot cb
jesus another obvious missed hold
apparently sammy watkins suffered a possible concussion in todays game
can we keep playing aggressive a lot of time left
i would not wanna be watson there and have campbell fall on you
bowser in coverage
another sack whiffed
how did whoever that was miss that sack
that block by project pat on the ingram td amazing
id like to see the oline and the rbs get some realtime chemistry going for the rest of this game were going to wantneed it at some point
justin reid is very good
damn that was a clutch stop on lamar ngl
go for it
surrender index is gonna flame us hard if we punt
anybody know if the neck gaiter harbs has is avail for purchase cant find it on any of the main sites nfl shop fanatics fansedge

also solid overall game go ravens
look like llama said ill do it myself lmao
not worth it thats how mahomes got hurt
the cardboard fans are kinda creepy
i wonder why lamar doesnt have audibles like mahomes does yknow how mahomes says 35 to signify snap it on 2 lmao
i want us to score 7 more i dont want to see us let up lets make a statement that even on our off days were better than most afc teams
lets make it 37

score again
one more score and put this thing to bed
can we just start with the gus bus from now on like let the man ram that dline a bit then swap in ingram dobbins to get loose on em then let gus carry the team home
wildcat dobby
did he hit lamar late
its not an officials timeoutthey were waiting until the ejected player left the bench area before resuming play
uhhh okay
buh bye bud
lamae ts plz
o line got it done on this drive
lamar td plz
well now it is time for kc it is on big time
go ahead with your bad self chuck clark
david johnson singlehandedly stripped the sack daddy monicker

someone said 90 was stomping lamars head is that true because wth
best back drafted this year
did we play gus so much as cover for the chiefs
dam we make it look to easy
now i just want them to put in justice hill to get his pounding in against the texans

how do ot rules work again
bowser is looking look so far hes been very active in these first 2 games always seems to be around the ball maybe 7 sacks this seasonalso boykin on offense but lj has so much weapons
tavon mr glass young smdh
that wasnt great lets just hope it was a rusty start
man im hoping its rust but our oline hasnt been good squeelers will eat this line alive
this is a closer game than it should be weird play calls and a shaky o line really not making me feel good

i fucking hope nobody falls injured here

that series was uninspired lol
it didnt look like anything even touched him
tayvon young hurt again wouldnt be surprised
roman calling this game way too cute run the god damn ball on first down
roman passing too much just like in the titans game
boykin is such a good ass blocker
sometimes i forget how spoiled we are with lamar
lamar needs to start sliding feet first
need stream plz my power went out no direct tv for me
boyles block game needs help
that wasnt holding ok
yea ive lost hope for this offensive line
oline doesnt look good

why make the texans do anything why not give them 3 points and call it halftime
rushing is not working at all which sucks
boykin the tightend
play calling is horrendous
i really want to see fluker just to see if he can make a difference he looked good last week
fuck with out those turnovers our defense really isnt that good so many wide open targets no pass rush cant finish tackles in the back field letting deshaun finish plays things that will not pass against playoff teams
has there been an update on tavon
lol houston fucking sucks so mad theres a 7 seed now they may make the playoffs
you cant park that bus
great block from boykin
oh yeah boy lets get that run game working
were getting lucky with the turnovers tbh this defense is suspect
little off today texans d not quite that good
throw short on 3rd flacco is that you
were also up 13 points so yeah while the oline play is frustrating i really doubt we lose this game
im very nervous for this game our pass rush is god awful and watson is a magician i also think our run defense is lackluster im nervous for every game though well probably win by 3 scores lmao
fucking hell tavon young mr glass needs to be cut he doesnt do anything for us besides leave us hanging
why the fuck cant our defense play defense right
this is probably the least hype ive been for a ravens game in a while lol
can someone pxp
clearly lamar took notes from kyler murray the goat of getting out of bounds rnfl had some great advice
obj getting used and abused by watt
defense looks shaky
havent caught the game today but from what ive seen a bit it seems lamar is a bit off and so is the line
the fact that it takes 50 people to tackle 1 person is concerning otherwise good d xd
cant believe were winning a home game 3016 in the 4th quarter and these dorky ass doofus in the booth spent more time talking about other teams qbs
sorry ass pass rush
does anyone else think watt is a huge douche
never was a fan of t young dude is too small for a cb
watson sucksbig money for medicore play
do we want the chiefs coming in after a loss i cant imagine them 12
are we going to see rgiii
idk what game yall are watching oline looked much better that drive held the pocket for lamar on most throws and had good run block the only bad play was the sack and they blitzed

so many casual fans
gonna be honest lamar has made the ol look worse on a number of plays this is looking like the steelers game hes seeing ghost rushers
our defense
i hope they dont try to draw a pentaly

you could pull that shit with cleveland but this defense is way too disciplined to do that
where to watch
lamar carrying rn

been watching redzone during commercials and all i can say is andy reid must really hate how he looks in a mask to go with the shield again
where was marlon going lol he just got up and ran the other way
offense looks sluggish today
jj watt make the executive decision to start juicing again
man the pocket was good there lamar ran into a sack
so sad that there is no ravens football next sunday

why are we not running
fade me
cant take a sack there ngl i was thinking hand it off and try a long fg lost 3 points
anyone else just watch peters get fucked up lmao
wow we give our running backs the ball and it works who woulda thought
lol go for it s
shit gotta punt imo
lol random challenge
why the fuck is bob calling timeout
beep beep busssss
gus bus
feed the bus
wheels on the bus going round and round right now
the bus
pat is such a boss
these refs are so fucking incompetent
is it sexist if i say melanie collins is hot
if we lose stanley next week is a done deal loss
lamar is panicking in the pocket we need the o line to step up to calm lamar
too much lamar running
what is lamar doing do you see the blitz get out of the pocket dude
can you guys not start blaming the refs that was an obvious penalty on averett he sucks
shades of romans playcalling against tennessee
tavon younggoing to be a meniscus or acl
who is this play by play announcer pretty annoying
there is no way they were snapping that ball waste of a timeout
we should have at least tried the hard count before throwing the challenge flag
thats shameful how did they possibly not get watson
is it me or has calais just not looked like his pro bowl season last year
how are we beating kc next week
these dumbass mistakes are going to doom us
all the hype just for 2 3 outs by both teams
aww go for it
honest question
how can we afford to pay stanley 22mil when the other 3 or 4 positions on our line are so bad against good pass rushes
wouldnt it make more sense to trade stabley draft a o line piece and pay someone who commands less 1215
jackson needs to do a better job of handing the ball off on the read option
is this an unpopular opinion i dont really think proche is that great as a returner
imagine being lamar jackson and instead of scrambling you collapse in the pocket smfh

edit thanks for the downvotes but yall know im right
stanley hurt now dude is so weak
what team is going to trade us for a corner this year cause me thinks we need one
terrible kick he almost missed
alright that state farm commercial was pretty good lol

were going to get lamar hurt we need to stop doing designed runs for him when its not necessary and he also needs to slide
going to lose


feels like as with what happened in baseball the lack of a preseason is causing more injuries


pas vegan mais content de voir que je suis pas le seul qubecois ici
vegetarian here currently enjoying some morningstar farms buffalo wings lol
meat lover here coming in peace
so what gives it a crab like flavor
im not a vegetarian but i love vegetarian food

man that guy was awesome i was so hurt when i heard he was off to the niners ive been a huge ricard fan as soon as they started having him line up in the backfield
only one thing

ricard is better
it throws me back to vonta leach
love me a nastyass fullback like a caterpillar d9 with an attitude and shoulder pads
juice looked very good because checkdown joe threw him the ball a billion times a game still very good but i dont think hed touch the ball nearly as much in this offense

fort has provided positives for us in that pick up starting from his first game edc and then coaching staff have taken full advantage of his hard work

what a fucking interception
i am reeling
that int was a thing of beauty
highlights are already up on youtube 432

damn shame we didnt capitalize on it though
that is some ed stuff right there

dont forget commercial star
once the jackson to tucker connection is mastered the league better watch out
hes also a pretty decent tackler when he needs to
just when the league thought they would catch up on our offense we sneak peak in a new clutch wr gameplan that bitches

lets not forget he also had a mean tackle in preseason a few years ago iirc the man is a swiss army knife
i wish hed run down the sideline and pretended he scored a td then spiked the ball

goodluck he will just take his all pro self and go to another team
stanley is one of the best offensive linemen in the game and is only dealing with a nagging ankle injury the past few weeks pump the brakes

i couldnt agree more levine is too slow averett gonna get exposed
averett made me want to waterboard myself
if your playing the chiefs that showed up today chiefs have zero chance beating you

we are playing a decent team up by 13 every game cant be a blowout homie
texans are a good team
were not the kd golden state warriors bro
were up by 13 and have won 13 straight regular season games everything is more than fine right now

we cant dominate every week this isnt madden
our oline looks crappy but the chiefs oline looks worse right now
our offense line wasnt good last week either and now the cracks are showing more and more we dont have the line we need to win it all currently

respect the instant ask lol
came here just for this
i need it
i cant think of a better celebration in recent memory the fact that he came up a bit short on the spin kick made it so much better

someone just posted sort by new
its on the ravens twitter
marky mark

no one knows what it means but its provocative
its like truss but big real big
its a way of life
big truzz is love big truzz is life
its like big chungus no one has a clue what it means but they love it

so were throwing spinning shit now
id love to see the whole run from this angle
strike first strike hard no mercy cobra kai
i said it in the other thread someone please superimpose the steelers logo
he looks like a power ranger lol
that net is dangerous
loved this play call
thats a spinning rear leg side kick
nobody giving respect to the double punch

cant wait for decosta to snag some great ol for a 9th round pick thats where the team needs it the most thankfully lamar has been so calm in the pocket
were like the antipackers in that regard lmao


bob trading his 1 target is still baffling
i sorta feel sorry for watson hes so legit and is with a coachgm that is gonna waste his youth
i like watson hes got great pocket presence and can extend plays

bob is just a dipshit ruining his and jj watts careers
i feel so bad for him
ive loved deshaun since he was at clemson and he deserves so much better than hes been given in houston bob is ontrack to waste a onceinageneration qbs career just like indy did with luck and its a fucking tragedy
that trade of deandre hopkins was epic stupidity
he looked so dejected that entire game
his talent is being wasted he deserves better than what hes getting
i feel bad for him i can never talk bad about him
he shouldve never resigned with texans they are gonna waste his career
thats life in the nfl somebody is going to lose
im rooting for him fr
the game thread was so shocked over how evasive he was i hold my breath every drop back i really dont get why people think hes overrated
my mom laughed louder each time they showed him frozen in rage and said it needed to be a meme
i wouldnt have signed the extension if i was him even if he outlasts bob chances are the next hc wont be significantly better and the organisation will continue to mismanage the pesonnel around him
the rules are simple

submit a playercoachposition group preferably in bold to stand out easier add statsreasoning if you want

make sure your nominee has not already been submitted

previous weeks

week 1 lamar jackson

this weeks nominees are
marlon humphrey

right hook from marlon swung the momentum completely and the texans never recovered
marcus peters marlon humphrey lj fort and patrick queen
the runningbacks

ingram with the swifty 4th down td

edwards with a bunch of backbreaking runs

dobbins with the nice 44 yard run to get us over 200 again
justin tucker

he didnt need to score a game winner but we havent given him the opportunity to often thankfully

his consistency is easy to overlook and take for granted but he kept the distance which is crucial as we play best with a lead so even when the offense couldnt get it done he got us some guaranteed points
tucker for always being reliable
gus edwards that drive was the backbreaker

dont get me wrong defence made plays like crazy but it was that drive where i wrote game over in my notebook
marlon humphrey

led the team in tackles 6 solo 1 assist and the clutch forced fumble
lamar jackson

im 100 percent convinced he makes this offensive line look decent if its any other qb we would have given up 10 sacks put fluker out there at rg and help orlando that right side was abused today
overall gus but forts play really turned the tide in our favour and he flashed in other plays as well
lamar dude kept so many offensive drives alive especially in the first half his stats are good but he played so much better than they say
defense other than anthony averett
decosta for gems signings like fort
mp juice man
the bus that couldnt slow down
so many people here are posting about the running backs but how about my boy patrick ricard blocking for all of them and opening up some massive holes to run through not to mention his layout goalline grab for the td
the gus bus making no stops and taking no prisoners since 2018



all running backs
defense made plays when it mattered and held our lead
while we had a good game and good players the oline got pummeled today albeit some of those were because of lamar running around but still gotta hold them boys back
everyone for sure lamar being lamar all the running backs putting in work mp and humph being great tucker not missing as usual not much to criticise other than you know who
another team win

humphrey killed it lamar did great ingram had an excellent run td jk with a game killing run gus controlling the clock fort picking up the fumble juiceman with the int elliott stoping that 4th down and a sack

everyone played well and still we got stuff we know to work on
secondary not named anthony averett

marlon and peters played lockdown coverage all game and each came up with a backbreaking turnover elliott had his first sack chuck kept everyone in position and jimmy played well in his limited role
lj fort looked like a rb on that pylon extension that defensive td is what first allowed us to pull away and we didnt look back


whole squad effort

pq looking like royalty marlon swinging harder than myles garrett lj fort taking it to the house mp juiceman out there pickin like its apple season

i thought some of lamars throws were a bit shaky today and ol was slacking but thats why this is a team our receivers made plays defense stepped it up and as always tucker gets it in

lamar wasnt bad by any means and did a fantastic job dealing with the pressure of an incredible texans d i meant moreso some of his passes were just on the edge and required good moves from our receivers the ricard td that was a bit low comes to mind at this point our competition is only ourselves and perfection is the standard we go by

defensedoes that count
marcus peters
offense gus
defense fort
greg roman gut punch with ingram wildcat completely demoralized the texans they were shell shocked after that
lamar and the run game

that ol in particular the right side did them no favors lamar was super fucking comfortable under pressure like usual and was on point even though he couldnt go deep like he wanted gus mark and jk albeit late but man that fucking run was electric were on fire
fort has fumble recoveries in back to back weeks and this one he turned on the jets let the big man get this one
running backs
gus edwards


lots of good plays and turnovers from them took a while to get some sacks but they eventually came through
running backs
going defense on this one creating turnovers and getting pressure on watson

gus edwards

marcus peters

that was a great interception you could give it to a bunch of guys as its a true team effort this time but im fine with spotlighting peters
im going to say boykin he didnt have the best game statistically but his presence was felt on the field at times he was invisible last year as a pass catcher run blocks well
ingram for the roundhouse kick and fooling a lot of us thinking that lamar got slow somehow
i cant pick just one so im going withour pro bowl cb duo

marlon humphrey marcus peters

i dont think marlon allowed a single completion and both contributed to turnovers plus the peters int was thing of beauty
lj needs some credit

of course its a team win but fort did a total tempo shift with the scoop and score

humphrey lamar the game plan jk they all work they always work

forts instincts and good angles and pure footballin got the game going the right direction

lfing j fort
the entire defense
marlon humphrey

the punch played great coverage all game and was bringing the energy the way he attacked the lead blocks on one of the plays had me hyped
marlon humphrey and patrick queen
marlon humphreymp juice man
one half of the best cornerback duo

marlon fruit punch humphrey
i vote for the secondary they did a great job slowing down houstons wr core and allowed our front 7 to go to work marlon had the big forced fumble peters that ed reed like interception and elliot with that sack
gus edwards marlon humphrey marcus peters lj fort lamar jackson and calais campbell are the players of the game candidates and the emmy goes to

lj fort
for me it would be the cornerbacks and tucker obviously
marlon humphrey forced a fumble that led to the gamebreaking td and made fuller nonexistent
wink martindale for the second year in a row he had the perfect game plan to stop deshaun watson coverage was excellent and he devised a good blend of blitzes so watson had no time to throw
marcus peters channeling ed reed on that pick

233 i think before the kneel downs so i think we ended up with 230 total
as far as i know he is an impending free agent after the season

i feel that we have to retain this guy hes fit in well with the scheme and lamar just wanted your thoughts on retaining him for next season
honestly hes amazing but rb is the one position where we can lose a guy due to our depth ingram jk and hill are an amazing trio if gus leaves just depends on how much money he wants
give me gus over hill

havent really been impressed with hill
yeah hes worth more to us than he is in a trade next year itll be jk and gus 1 and 2 cut ingram to save cap space but maybe hell resignrestructure on a cheaper team friendly deal

hes a rfa next year
gus probably gets a deal on some other team we dont have the cap to go for him we probably pick up a rb day 2 or 3 if not another udfa it is sad but with c ap dropping so much and the paydays we have to make he doesnt fit in the books
ill say gus is a killer late in a game with the fresh legs we provide him
honestly for the future ill take gus over ingram cause mark us getting old
i really think edc would be amiss to not resign him hes a great 1b 2 back and his 1 cut power style really fits us on 3rd and short

hes got great vision between the guards and fights for yards


id really like to resign him to a deal similar to kareem hunts you then match him with jks contract
gus is a rfa prolly pull 35millyr in free agency

ingram is gonna cost 633 next year can save 5 mill with cut but can prolly pay him whatever we would have to pay gus to keep him

justice is gonna be cheap still

probably trade gus to the jets to replace bell extend ingram keep hill and dobbins
i saw ingram shaking his head and talking to someone on the sideline on his last run its pretty clear mark thought he shoulda scored but it seems like gus is more worried about contact or just doesnt have the elusive necessary no one may have notice but mark points to his head and you can tell its regarding gus not being a very innovative or creative back

i might be an idiot here but isnt it 22 wins

i thought he was 71 rookie year 132 last year and now 20 this year
lamar 2020 make america truzz again build back better baltimore
10 terms please
holy shit this picture
in god we truzz
presiden ollama
i would vote for him for actual president over the two morons currently going for it
we should definitely lose one of our next 7 games so we dont go 283 heard those are cursed numbers


this is gold
make america belee again
2 playoff games and 142 last year 4 losses still amazing
youre forgetting two games
oh president my president
my mom thought this was real lol
hes lost to as many teams in 25 regular season games kccle as he has in 2 playoff games sdten

as bad as this sucks for him we gotta restructure that contract paying him lots to never play a full season
3 missed full seasons now
really feel for the guy hopefully averett can step up because he was getting dotted up all game
the best ability is availability
well he only has season ending injuries so i didnt expect anything less
dude needs to retire
tavon is a great player but at a certain point out for the season just becomes who you are 3 of these now idk how much hes got left
are you fucking kidding me thats just shy of 2 full seasons missed in two seasons
man tavon is such a baller cb he plays way bigger than his size and was an incredible find i wish he would get rid of whatever luck is plaguing him
so can we go get carr back from the cowboys practice squad i dont want to see averett on the field trying to stop any of the chiefs receivers next week
time to restructure that contract
come ongod dammit
what else is new
this sucks
really unfortunate for him
fuck this
what team is tanking so we can pry their slot corner away for a 5th
i feel fucking terrible for him cant even imagine what hes going through
im not sure he should be cut next year right off the bat but at this point weve got to plan as if hes not in the depth chart
bro hes good but he gets hurt so much hes missed over 30 games now he should retire
dude cant catch a break next man up
hate to say it but he cant be relied on he shouldnt be on the roster at the start of next season
fuckkkk this one hurts
it certainly seems destined that tavon young deshon elliott are not supposed to play together whenever one is healthy the other one is injured ever since tavons contract extension he has played a grand total of one full game that signing sure looks like one of decostas worst decisions as gm right up there with the et3 debacle

it is a shame because he is a pretty special player when available however it feels as if he has been injured more than jimmy smith lardarius webb combined im exaggerating of course yet another reminder why brandon carr should have never been let go too bad they had to learn this inevitable predictable lesson the hardest way possible
on february 21 2019 young signed a threeyear 258 million contract extension with the ravens making him the highestpaid nickelback in the nfl


cant predict injuries but this hurts
really sucks but hes gotta get cut next yr he was one of my favorites on d too
yep i knew hed get hurt he gets hurt every year
should have resigned carr cb getting super thin
this is probably the end sucks so bad really liked the dude
couldnt watch the game live howd it happen
anyone know how much wed save wasnt his contract right up there at the time i feel for the guy but with zero production we need that money for stanleyhumphreyandrews etc
5th round pick for the jets best cornerbackincoming
well that sucks and with the cap being extremely tight next year i can definitely see him being on the chopping block

its a shame but i think hes going to end up being one of the great what ifs in team history
they gotta cut him at this point its every single year
cut him forever who cares how good he is if he is injured for 50 of his career
there absolutely cannot be any other franchise that has ever been more ravaged by constant injuries to secondary members than what our favorite team has gone through for approximately a decadeplus but hey who cares about a guy that never missed a game in his career just let him leave i pine for brandon carr over anthony averett but those pipe dreams are long gone


holy shit your unread emails give me heartburn
how do you do this on i phone
wait how do you do this
can i get that picture from the widget

lynn is a coward
id rather play the chiefs coming off a close win than a close loss to a rival

how do you get that effort from your team and just hand the chiefs the ball stopped on 4th and 1 or punted to the chiefs 1 yardline you lost the game so dont take it out of your players hands
you cant give them the ball back plain and simple conservative football loses against the chiefs offense
talking about this guy like hes 1 of a kind
thats exactly what i was thinking
yeah i usually love romo but that was just a stupid statement from him
wish you wouldve posted the context no idea what youre talking about
as much a i love to hear the goat getting respect butker is literally the next one in line for career after him so one of a kind no but not many as good as him tucker just happens to be better
the main issue is that the ravens dont have to settle for those king attempts very often meaning tucker cant show case his skills as often
they all want tuckers spot but they cant have it
the chiefs sub really believes his comments to like no one could ever hit a 58 yard fg lmao
im fine with that let them forget tucker is the ravens best kept secret in the nfl
i mean hes paid to talk about the teams and players hes there commenting for
whats the big deal let em enjoy their winthey didnt disrespect tuck
i think we are taking this too personally

is the nfl converter bot still around the website is cancer on mobile

got a feeling we will be seeing the back of averetts jersey a lot next week
the turf monster got him it almost got jk on that 40 yard run as well
why did we believe he wasnt made of glass when history clearly shows this guy is made of glass


fool me three times fuck the peace sign
guys career has to be done he didnt do anything abnormal to injure it he just jumped and landed normal


the play he was injured i couldnt even tell what happened to him he is just made of glass

trade for a db sign a free agent or bring a guy up from practice squad give me your thoughts
if we base it off history well probably trade our washing machine for jaire alexander
sign lamar jackson right now
jimmy will go to cb and well likely promote from within at reserve safety levine will play a lot more in dime packages
i mean he was out all of last season too no
once carr goes back down to ps i think he was pulled up against this week i say we sign him on monday and bench averett
we play football

i mean young was out all of 2019 and 2017 we played the chiefs last year with carr averett and canady and lost on a 3rd down conversion

i think we will be fine
maybe josh nurse who was having a pretty good offseason could be promoted within and play nickel
trade a 5th round pick for strap harris
my guess would be jimmy to outside corner marlon to slot corner geno stone or nigel warrior getting more reps at safety

i saw the username before i opened the thread and i was like oh hell no no you didnt

id say trade for him but the dudes injury cursed
jj is a monster when healthy
i really like jj pure drive and talent while staying humble
jj honestly feasted against our o line they need to do something about the right side put dj fluker in at rg to see if hes any better for now
watt was a fucking menace against us
whispers win it all im rooting for you
i love jj watt and as a firefighter myself seeing him do the fire training is always a great watch
jj was their best player yesterday he was all over us
two humble classy guys sharing a hug stop staring perverts
sounds like yet another season ending injury early in the season thats 3 out of 5 seasons

sucks man just hate it for him
this is unpopular but he needs to be gone yeah hes good really good i like him but hes never available 35 years with season enders is too much and we cant afford to pay him for that
he needs to go man hes eating up too much cap space to be constantly injured
we better be paying everett in peanuts and bubble gum because hes doodoo
even worse is he wont get a good second contract


udrdilatory unsportsmanlike conduct automatic snf win
for context i voiced my opinion on a flag in the ne sea game that i disagreed with and the man comes at all of us like the dirty patriots fan he is oh well shows the class that new enlganders have




hes talking about the super bowl champion reigning coach of the year right literally the only former raven that has ever had this much of an issue with the organizationharbs dude needs to stfu and realize maybe he was the problem
pollard arguing with randos on twitter shows just how dumb he is and how big of a mistake it was to have him on an nfl team
he said he was kidding after torrey is too nice
pollard had too many helmet to helmet hits
for some reason i thought it was bernard pierce but yeah pollard is a dumbass
honestly its really weird that he still actively shit talks harbaugh this long after his career has ended

github whatsnew
honestly pollard sounds like hes got pretty bad cte
dude has been balling these last 2 weeks yet gets no love keep doing your thing 58
he gets no love he gets lots of positive praise
theres literally an lj fort appreciation thread on the front page you loon
pretty sure every raven knows lj fort i think i have even been able to forget he was a steeler
cant believe we got him for free via the eagles lmfao
he definitely gets noticed hes a great veteran presence and off ball lb to compliment queen and harrison
congratulations again on being 20 love you all and happy we could join you in that category
i have aaron and aaron on my fantasy team and theyre making me look like a genius
it was looking dicey for you all early but not surprised at all that the packers were able to pull away once the lions became the lions again
happy cake day
aaron jones is a monster
jesus yall have a scary team rn see you in february
thanks buddy

aww man its devastating for the kid all the talent in the world and the body just cant hold out i cant imagine the frustration cut him a break
no need for this imho the guy has played well and hard for us and rehabbed from multiple injuries

not his fault that hes hard luck

sometimes im embarrassed by my fellow fans
bro delete this
as we are used to being delighted with over 30 pts per game almost every week since last year however today the o line being out of groove almost costed things on offense and if this wouldve happened against a better team theres no doubt we wouldve lost this game

i like to focus on the fact that the game was won and thats all it matters but its becoming a serious concern that the offensive line will start affecting play calling and what can be done on offense
the offense wasnt able to take any deep shots or call any deep long developing plays since the pass rush was too intense which immediately took an effect on what hollywood and andrews bring to the table ingram struggled a lot at beginning same with lamar which seemed to bump into sacks since the guys in front were literally being pushed back im hoping since theyll have an extra day of rest this next week they can clean this up otherwise the chiefs defense can make life difficult for them not that theyre an elite defense but theyre pretty damn good if given the opportunity and their opponent is caught slacking
whats most important is how much better lamars passing is hes throwing absolute zingers all day
good points but most teams dont have a garretwatt wrecking shit either those two are elite talents lets see what happens against more pedestrian lines before sounding the alarms
i know im not the only one when i say that this felt like the least rewarding win weve had in a very long time hardly feels like a win at all and to me thats because of everything you just mentioned above

it felt like the last two seasons with joe flacco and marty nothing but dump offs and a few check downs our line effectively ensured that mark andrews brown and the rest of our textbook corp was effectively out of the entire game

oh and also where the fuck was dobbins this entire night besides his 40 yard scamper in garbage time did he have a bad week of practice or something what gives

also we are not going to be win like this against the chiefs or washington with our line so suspect
i felt at times lamar was doubting himself on the rush attempts a couple times i felt he was in two minds
unpopular opinion the ol wasnt as bad as it seemed on passing plays

i thought lamar ran into 2 sacks and was indecisive on a third unlike week 1 most weeks i thought lamar was feeling too many ghost pressures while not reading the leverage of pass rushers which led to sacks for instance tyre phillips had his man blocked on one play lamar scrambled in a way that allowed the dl to uncover and sack him tyre went from doing a good job pass blocking a guy to allowing a sack because his qb ran into the defenders path

the texans did a good job squeezing the pocket with their ends however weve seen lamar move brilliantly in the pocket in situations like that in the past today lamar looked like the lamar we saw in the steelers game last yr

also i thought jj watt in particular was great at readingand attacking the mesh point

either way lamar still had an efficient and productive day he is a great player i just thought he made the ols job harder than it shouldve been today in a few instances

the ols run blocking on the other hand wasnt good in the first half

honestly theres no one who consistently gets the short end of the stick as much as tyrod i really doubt herbert doesnt start after that performance sending all positive vibes to him but man just terrible luck in his career

selfish would love to have him back in charm city if anything happens to rgiii
he looked terrible last week and herbie looked real good today he wont be the starter
tyrod is not good he is a backup
if anyone watched it breaks my heart to see boyle apparently doesnt get along with humphrey
i think its just a joke between marlo and boyle cause if im not mistaken marlon always calls him a jerk and maybe boyle gets a lil hurt from it but i dont think they dont get along
havent seen it but who cares i have disliked a lot of coworkers over the years you cant like everyone
i think its a mixture and of things youve got a quiet ass white guy around a bunch of hype high energy black guys their energy doesnt match at all i dont think its as big of a problem as it seems tho
it didnt seem like anything to me
unpopular opinion marlon strikes me as the kind of guy i would hate to be around every day

that said hes a baller ass corner so who cares what my perception of him is based on limited social media insight
i honestly felt so awkward watching that it really seemed like boyle and andrews hated marlo
why what happened
man its the first im hearing about it but we dont need to more beef or drama in the locker room after the earl thomas shit
damn thats whack lol
marlon honestly sounds irritating lol


bruh these bandwagoners are something else
dudewere not invincible texans have strengths and weaknesses just like we do they have playmakers guys like jj watt are destined to make an impact relax well be fine
naw still feels like a win to me nephew
my god man the browns have garret the texans have watt those two are game wreckers the rest of the talent on those lines ravens oline isnt elite but its certainly not time to sound the alarms yet
found the fan that didnt sit through 201317
duv didnt score
we are 20 i doesnt matter if you win by 1 or 30a wins a win as a matter of fact how does a win feel like a loss
you fans need a damn snickers
all those problems and we still won by 3 scores which tells me we will probably be okay

also duv didnt score
the opponent is allowed to make plays they are professional athletes too
if outgaining our opponent by 100 yards controlling the clock and doubling the scoreboard is getting exposed expose me 14 more times we just took 3 knees inside their 30 to win fella sober up
chill its week 2
man i literally just sat here watching the game and said out loud i still cant figure out how to feel about putting up 30 pts a game consistently its such a change from every year ever no matter how bad the oline play was or how lethargic it seemed you still gotta bring at least a 30 bomb to stay in touch with lamarso far the only teams averaging that besides us is the packers and seahawks and most likely the saints after tomorrow

then you look at the defense and the packers and hawks are giving up 225 pts a game vs our 11 pts a game next best defense is the raiders giving up 15 a game

point is we are the most balanced team in the nfl bringing the most explosive offense with a tough defense neither has to be perfect and can give a little which is what you saw the last two weeks garrett and watt both did what they get paid for some of the best in the game on offense chubb and hunt are gonna get their yards on any night watson is gonna make plays and try to win but nobody is putting it all together like we are right now
you cant fault the o line for giving up the hits to lamar by jj jj is a top echelon defensive player who is capable of making any o line break down it just is what it is theyll get better but im certainly not gonna fault em for not being able to stop jj watt
holy fuck

we got some fans on here actually complaining about the offense not that they played poorly just that they didnt play good enough despite scoring 30 points likei honestly never believed that day would come im an old school ravens fan i remember production like this was rare and appreciated so im a little shocked at some of the posts im seeing its not in big numbers yet

but i would like to remind old and new fans just how good we have it right now old fans that are complaining remember boller and streaky flacco thats all ill say new fans take it easy its 33 points against what i consider to be a good team so hopefully this post puts some of the complaints im seeing into perspective

we are lucky to have lamar

edit furthermore the chiefs didnt do too well on offense either more perspective for you
ill take the w any day of the week you play to win the game
anybody that saw boller and flacco must literally thank their stars to have lamar jackson as qb right now he is far and away the best football player in the league and lets just be thankful we have him flacco was streaky sure but when he stunk he was a lot of wood under center literally
i was at work thinking huh off day for the offense then i thought huh i remember when we beat the bills like 137 only a few short years ago


bandwagoners man
agree with you but offense didnt score 30 pts just want to credit our d which in those days you speak of were also like our offense too today the d scoop n score reminded me of those days
we played a smart game managed our lead and ran out clock

it may not have been big explosive passing plays but it meant we didnt take any risks and maximised our chance of winning the game
new fans are insufferable kids cant appreciate shit
im happy with the comfortable w but am concerned about iol play and still have questions about our passing game we did not necessarily need it today but i still want to see what boykin and hollywood got we might get a chance next week with kansas city
its football lets be happy that we are getting scores from every way possible rushing throwing defensive turnovers well oiled machine
honestly im fine with it shows that as a team we can win different ways depending on how the defense is playing browns want to stop the run lamar throws for 275 and 3 touchdowns texans want to stop the big plays we dink and dunk and run our way to the win

and its only week 2 were 20 while not playing our best
only real complaint is too many sacks never didnt have the lead to complain too badly
idk about others but personally i was concerned just bc we saw what a welloiled machine we were last year and we still came up short im not ungrateful that we can finally expect the team to handle lesser teams but i just get worried what will happen we go up against true championship contenders those teams will exploit your weaknesses
im happy about the offense they are top 5 in the league just concerned about the line its getting lamar killed
most years a lot of teams dont gel until after 4 games this year with no preseason it may be 6 games im happy with the progress though and look forward to more
the bandwagon is real
im almost positive i heard him say he wouldve voted for russ for mvp last year but he lost his ability to vote because he didnt submit his ballot the year before essentially ruining lamars unanimous mvp ive spent enough time listening to him praise pittsburgh as is now that
he is a spiteful hateful sob that has consistently hated on the ravens just listen to that chicken neck fuck call a steelersravens game and youll understand that he is uber biased pos that is the reason why i dont trust pff one bit
ive found i really like tony romo jim nanz

edit charles davis
i believe a few people voted russ allpro but didnt dare vote for anyone else for mvp i dont think collinsworth was one of them though

he is hella biased in his commentary though for the team he prefers
and he would have been the lone idiot there was no one last year that was even remotely close to lamar there is just no arguement to be made for anyone else
what can you expect from a sad and ringless former bengal a team whos only job is to spite the afc division leader
people who think mvp just means elite quarterback with the worst teammates are wrong and stupid and bad
chris collinsworth reminds me always of the gimp from pulp fiction
lamar is still better then wilson
yeah i heard this too and was like what then he was laughing like yah i would have been that one guy oh well


besides all the comments here about bias my biggest beef with collinsworth is hes shitty at his job hell say stuff like that looks like a catch but i dont know what a catch is any more dude its your fucking job how about you look up the goddamn rule and learn what a fucking catch is

edit if i told my boss these javascript libraries keep changing i dont know how to code anymore id be fucking fired
hey wait as an old time fan i love chris collins collinsworth and he has always always had the ravens back as much as a color guy can he called both our superbowls before we even got to the playoffs


this image has been reported
no fro marlo
is marlon finally off the market cuz if you go to that megkurkowski chick in his comments from her instagram story she look likes shes watching his cat snowflake right now

sorry i was bored this morning

hopefully it grows it back
okay why did marlo cut off his fro
is that the joker suit
did he ride his bike to the game
why should anyone care bigger issues in the world these days

yea i heard that too after watching jtuck kick 4 fgs today
tuck wouldve made that 58 yarder too tho
oh ok i wasnt the only one to do this
i hope that next monday night justin tucker hits 63 yard game winner so then we can use the and i took that personally meme
seems people have already forgotten about that 61 yard gw but whatever
romo is such a chiefs blowhard i honestly am happy we dont have them for the chiefs he never sea impressed by lamar
i did the same thing
i felt the same watching the 2 pats games and the commentator going on about cams option read play and how long he holds the ball while making the read like seriously did you watch a single ravens game in 2019
tucker is the greatest kicker of all time
if i hear the words best kicker its a built in trigger in my brain itll catch my attention everytime
im not looking for a butker vs tucker duo jackson vs mahomes is what we are coming for
anyone notice the obvious hes playing in a fucking stadium when he kicks 58 yards go kick 58 yards in fucking charm city brother


i know all of reddit loves him but i really dont think romo is that great of an announcer

lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season never this type of adulation even before the season started alot of folks annointed russ the mvp
why was it so diff from lamar it seems to me russell is the perfect type of qb and face for the nfl they want to promote not the florida dialect heavy qb
lamar was voted a unanimous mvp i think he got his recognition
lamar got plenty of praise once the season was underway last year he was unanimous mvp

russell wilson is arguably the best qb playing right now and hes a good dude deserves every bit of it
if youre going by that broadcast than yea collins would suck wilsons dick dry if he could but right now wilson is dominating his numbers are ridiculous

praising one qb is not a knock on another
lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season never this type of adulation

lol wut did you not watch the games or follow the media last year

yes a lot of people are saying that its wilsons turn but his play so far has been worthy of being considered its a long season and if awards were given in the preseason the browns would have won the superbowl last year
people were all over lamars dick man

he was unanimous mvp cover of madden running on sports center nonstop people were constantly saying oh my god he actually can pass

it was glorious not sure what planet you were on but this post just sounds whiny af
bro dont be salty lamar gets tons of praise

russ has more tds than incompletions rn dude is balling

russells that good though
lets not have conspiracy theory crap here please once the ravens beat the seahawks last year it was nonstop praise for lamar last year or did you just conveniently forget that
maybe youre looking too into it granted russ was receiving a lot of recognition last season too and rightfully so he was doing great too but lamar did unanimously win mvp theres no more recognition than that and youd see a highlight of lamar posted every chance the nfl could post it russ is just playing insane at the moment and hopefully he can continue cause hes a baller and a great person
lamar was unproven at that point and announcersmedia just play it safe they know russ is great so they dont have to really face the music if he ends up playing poorly enough to lose mvp or mvp votes


of drew lock or haskins came out this season playing like wilson did they wouldnt get the hype from media people because the media people do not have much to work with from other seasons


lamar did get hype pretty early on though
dude there are many other players in the league who excell russell wilson is playing incredibly well right now the dude is making insane throws his production with the olines hes had is amazing lamar is doing lamar things he was the unanimous mvp last year its ok for other people to get attention

the media slobbed on our knobs all last year lamar won player of the week i dont know how many times like yes lamar has faced adversity for how he sounds but this just seems like a bit of a stretch to me
lamar never got praise what is this man talking about he literally got the mvp lol
lets not be like seahawks fans last year there is no reason to shit on russ to try and prop up lamar let russ get his well deserved hype and focus on the ravens

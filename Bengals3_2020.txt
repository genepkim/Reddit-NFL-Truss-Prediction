He should be your QB too because he should be everyone‚Äôs QB. It‚Äôs Joe fucking Burrow
"Welcome to Meet Then Enemy, /r/bengals Q&A Thread for each matchup.  
We figured the fans on each team's sub more about their team, so why don't we ask each other?  

This week we're inviting the fans over at /r/chargers   for some friendly Q&A. 
Chargers fans, help yourself to some flair on the sidebar!  

*No trash talk or flamebaiting allowed, this is a civil thread.*"
I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs finally here!!!! Let‚Äôs do this!
"Whatdup Bengals. I don't get a lot of the shit you guys get. Your team is low key dope as fuck. Burrow is gonna ball out all season and I'm glad AJ Green is back. GL this week, lets get a good game with no injuries."
"Hello weekly enemy. I am Bengals fan :) I like Chargers and Charger uniforms but do not like the Spanos. pls do not do an injure and I hope Joe Burrow does lots of TDs :)

fuck the steelers"
"Fun fact: Bengals are my second favourite team, when I was about 5 years old paying madden I thought the tiger stripe and lightning bolt helmets were the best(obviously they still are) but as I got older and we drafted LT that was the deciding factor for my fandom. But I'm still a sucker for the bengals.

Fuck the Raiders and Steelers!"
"Hey Charger fans, what‚Äôs your season at QB looking like? My college team is Oregon and I‚Äôve seen a few episodes of Hard Knocks, Herbet definitely can sauce the pigskin, but will he sit all year?"
"It‚Äôs really time man, I‚Äôm so excited for this season"
Obviously I want to win the game but for it to be a successful day I‚Äôm my mind we just need everyone to stay healthy and show flashes. Keep it a close game at least!
"I'm intrigued to know more about the Bengals Defence.

They got torn apart last year, by pundits, for their poor performances. How do you feel about your D this year? I suspect the Chargers will go in with a run heavy game plan, but I know you've improved there. How is your pass D?
We're missing Williams, but still have Keenan and some younger receivers who have shown flashes. 

Also, on a long-term note, what would Bengals fans consider a successful season? Taking into account a rookie QB with limited practice time and no on-field time?"
Just wanted to say as a Chargers fan I love this thread. Great idea to get fans to come over and talk in a peaceful manner.
u/ford9863 - are the scientific delusions coming back this year? Those made me laugh week after week!
"I'm a bit sorry for everything our defensive line is gonna do to your brand new fancy QB in Burrow. His first game speed experience and he faces Joey Bosa against Bobby Hart, and Melvin Ingram against Jonah Williams"
"Chargers Defense is pretty loaded


Ingram and Bosa are a very good pass rush duo with Linval Joseph stuffing the run


Hayward, Chris Harris Jr., Nasir Adderely (2nd round pick ball-hawk FS) in the secondary.


We have a lot of young promising players in the Linebacker, SS, CB, and second DT position.


Our defense is great against the pass and we are playing against a rookie Tackle and Bobby Hart so pressure is going to coming fast for Joe Burrows with very good coverage playmakers. But we have a history of getting destroyed by rookies, and the Chargers are a very unlucky team.


Our offense is using Run Pass Option, starting Tyrod Taylor. Tyrod has a history of not being a good decision maker, sub par thrower, and very passive about making big time throws. Expect a lot of short throws, QB scrambles etc. Tyrod also gets sacked a-lot because of his tendencies to hold the ball. Now he could come out and surprise us, but at this point of his career its unlikely. 


Our C Pouncey and WR Mike Williams are Questionable. Our Left Tackle position is a WIP and will probably be below average to bad and our WR group outside of Keenan Allen is 2 Late round Rookies and a promising UDFA.


Expect the Chargers Offense to be run heavy with QB scrambles and short to medium conservatives throws. While Joe Burrow is dealing with a lot of pressure in a new offense, but him and the playmakers getting it done to a certain extend."
"Chargers fans: Even without Derwin (awful injury, love watching that guy play) your secondary is still pretty legit right? This defense is a tough one for Burrow to play off the bat. 

I feel like this game will come down to Mixon, if he can eat then we can keep pace but I don‚Äôt think you can expect Burrow to light it up on the Chargers defense week 1."
"Joe Burrow: How many times are you guys gonna get past my tackles?

Joey and Melvin: Yes."
"LSU fan so I love Joe Burreaux. Will be rooting for y‚Äôall every other game.

I really wish we had Derwin so the first game of Joe‚Äôs great career would be getting crushed by an absolutely loaded defense.

What is yalls score prediction?"
"Just watched Hard Knocks and it hurts seeing James go down, especially with the same injury (different knee). I only root against the Chargers when they play us, have always liked the powder blue unis. Stay healthy etc etc"
"Bengals fan since I was little. We‚Äôve got a great team this year (as always). Super optimistic this year, Burrow and the Bengals offense are going to great things!"
"Howdy, Chargers fan here. Ready for some good clean fun and ü§ûno injuries ü§û"
How do you Bengals fans feel about your run defense? I expect the tyrod offense to be run heavy
plz be gentle Joey...
"How is the receiver position for the bengals looking? I know AJs been hurt, Boyd seems solid, and than from there it‚Äôs either Ross or Higgins.. it‚Äôll be a good matchup vs our secondary"
Where dey? Coming from LA. I‚Äôm interested to see the Jackboyz vs Burrow matchup! It‚Äôs going to be a good way to see how our defense goes without Derwin. Let‚Äôs have a good game!
Glad to see these again
"I expect this to be a really messy game without a preseason, honestly."
"I hope the bad weather stays away, but at the same time, a run-heavy physical game may be what we need to win with how filthy their pass rush is."
Fuck yeahhh football is almost here!! Good luck to all bengal bros. Hope it's a fun and healthy game for both squads!
"Ahhh the question everyone wants to know about, Joe Burrow.

How many times does my main man Bosa bring him to his knees?

For real though, what are you actual predictions for his first time being let out of the house?"
Hope everyone stays safe and Burrow comes out with a record QB debut! Lets see what our first overall draft pick bought us with him. FUCK PITTSBURGH GO BENGALS
Ok honest question for any charger or bengals fan the bengals didn‚Äôt have any full tackling practices I see that as a huge red flag heading into the first game have the chargers had any tackling practices?

"Well, at least we're having an NFL Season(I still think it's possible this season will be suspended, and finished by April, 2021). 

With that out of the way, this is the first time since the 2005-2006 Season that the Los Angeles Chargers will have the starting Quarterback of one of their games not named Philip Rivers. 

It will be a close game, and let's just have a fun, safe, and COVID-19 free game.

Who Dey!?"
"Some would say Bengals ML is a bad idea. I say fuck off, Burrow is bringing the W home today baby. Geaux Bengals!"
I would love to see aaron donald put on a show. We may not do so hot but i think Joe will take failures constructively.

"This year the teams can protect players each week (Tuesday at 4pm) that can't be signed to other teams before the next game.

Some insight as to who probably just missed the cut to 53. With Williams still coming back from injury and Ross/Green's injury history I bet Henderson and Morgan are both protected for a while."
"Moderately surprised Brandon Allen isn‚Äôt on the list. If for some reason he gets poached, and Burrow and Finley both test positive, I can‚Äôt imagine what we would do. Not saying that‚Äôs likely, and I‚Äôm fine with the players we protected, but that‚Äôs kinda where my mind goes"
Guess we're telling other teams to get out of our swamp.

Good group though."
No Geno or Dunlap? Who was previously a captain but is no longer?
"With that stache, I would follow Gio to storm down the gates of hell"
"Very confused that Geno and / or Carlos aren't captains. 

Not sure how to feel about it, if I'm being honest."

"Been running this for 5 years now. Usually see more than 5,000 predictions from fans from all 32 teams and get some interesting information out of it.  Here is last years [preseason prediction survey](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tblausey#!/vizhome/DraftNFL2019/rNFL2019PreseasonPredictionSurvey ). 

In 2016, the Cowboys had the highest homer bias score (68%), and the Seahawks, followed closely with a (65%) bias score, as the rest of the league was on the Cardinal bandwagon. Both won their divisions.

In 2017, I poked fun at the Jags, Bills and Rams fan bases, all of whom had 70%+ bias scores, calling them delusional. Many were huge underdogs coming into the year. I was left eating crow as they all made the playoffs.

I cannot find any reference to this in 2018, but I know I did one.

In 2019 the Titans scored the highest homer bias score ever of 80%, and Vikings came in second with 75%. While neither won their division, both over performed in the playoffs."
I got the Seahawks winning it all this year boys
Saints over the Ravens in the Super Bowl.
Hopefully I do better than last year

Relentless pursuit of greatness. I'm excited.
"Hey there Benglas fans!

I‚Äôm starting a new sports podcast (Sports Optimist) where we talk about how every team can win a Super Bowl. The first trio is the Jags, Washington, and of course The Bengals!

So I‚Äôm asking fans, how can The Bengals win it all for the 2020-2021! Joe Burrow could continue his insane winning streak, the offensive skill positions are loaded, there‚Äôs reason for optimism. 
We‚Äôll be reading the best responses on our podcast, looking forward to your answers.

The podcast preview is already out on Spotify, the first episode should be available Thursday morning!"
Please. Please just let us play a game before dealing with these types of pipe dreams
Not comparing him to anyone specifically but rumors have it our starting qb can walk on water as well as turn it into wine
The defensive line and WR from top to bottom those 2 units are the best in the nfl then you add a top 7 RB in joe Mixon
Two words: Joe. Burrow.
Our Super Bowl is winning a playoff game soo
It‚Äôd be nice but it isn‚Äôt gonna happen with a zero experience QB and a 2nd year coach.
"The offensive line improved enough to give Joe Burrow time in the pocket to make plays to his great WR Corp while also allowing Joe Mixon to control the game so we don‚Äôt have to rely on the rookie QB. 

Every unit on defense improved through FA and the draft (assuming Logan Wilson and ADG are solid).

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say in 5 months when the Bengals actually win the Super Bowl"
"Ryan Shazier is not an idol or an inspiration.

His tackling style was considered reckless and he was warned multiple times that his tackling style will cause injuries to others and even to himself. 

Let's not forget he could have injured other players and he has. Remember that awful hit on Gio Bernard in the head? That was Ryan Shazier. Good thing Gio wasn't seriously injured. NFL even had to change the rules because of Shazier's action on the field. That's how bad and dangerous he was. 

[Source](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/03/21/ryan-shaziers-hit-in-playoffs-will-now-be-a-penalty/)

There are plenty of online articles already documenting his dangerous tackling technique on the field:

[Source](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/steelers-film-room/2016/8/29/12684214/steelers-film-room-ryan-shaziers-tackling-can-cause-hair-pulling)

The worst did happen to Ryan Shazier. I am glad he is able to walk and be healthy again. Living a productive and healthy life is more important than the glories on the playing field.

But he was reckless and he caused this to himself.

If a reckless driver crashed his car and got paralyzed then regained his walking ability, is the driver an inspiration? In my honest opinion, no.

Let's not forget he thought he could go back to playing even though the doctor told him he would be seriously injured again with his condition and he blew them off like their opinions didn't matter. Seriously, this guy was way over his head.

He can contibute more to football as a coach than as a player and that's what he should be focusing on instead of the pipe dream of playing football again."
"I'll never forget Shazier dancing on the sideline celebrating a hit on Gio while Gio was lying motionless on the field and being treated by medical personel.  I will never wish harm on another person, but Shazier is classless.  I am glad he can walk, but I will never respect him.  You reep what you sow."
"These type of things are the epitome of why I hate the steelers...such a stupid bias, ryan shazier gets praised for the way he played. Fuckin changed a rule because of the guy. The entire world hated burfict and watched him play with a dam microscope.  It's just so biased regardless if your a fan of them or not."
I wonder how the steelers subreddit would react to this being posted in their subreddit lol
"The first thing that comes to mind is him lowering his head (the same moved that injured himself.) and Gio being knocked out cold and do you know what Shazier did?

He fucking danced on the sideline."
There's people in /r/nfl calling him a true hero. What the fuck
[deleted]
"100% agree. And I think the only reason people idolize or rather ""elevate"" him is simply because he got hurt catastrophically and humans and media just don't know how to react to it while being PC. But I'm with you, man. Dude was the classic accident waiting to happen.

Unrelated: you forgot to link your sources but I can almost guess the two plays you're referring to so that tells you how bad he was at tackling. IIRC, he had at least three instances of that at OSU that a Steeler fan none-the-less had pointed out on YouTube a while back."
"He aimed to hurt people.

And then he hurt himself using his malicious play style."
"Oh man. This sounds bad but it's too funny to not share. My brother in law, in an Xbox party with me, will not stop complaining about Shazier being in Madden (post injury) and having a crazy high rating. The next morning, I wake up to a message from him: a video of Shazier attempting to walk and the text ""97 Madden rating, my fucking ass"""
"Some things are unique to the current era, including rules that are (arguably) overprotective of the QB and new concepts like illegal cutback blocks and ""defenseless receivers."" The known danger of leading with the crown of the helmet/spearing is far from a new thing. Spearing has been illegal for years for the very reason that it could paralyze a player.

My uncle coached youth football in the 80s.  Whenever he saw a player lead with his helmet, either in a game or in practice, he would immediately pull him out. They would then have to read aloud the warning on the back of the helmet.  He rarely won any games, but possibly prevented serious injuries down the line."
Agreed
"I think you have to seperate this a little bit more.

Ryan Shazier should not be idolized for his reckless playing style. I don't think thats arguable if you watch his play.

He should be applauded for making the best out of a horrible situation. We all do bad shit that causes pain to others and ourselves, and I like to try and judge people on what they do after. 

Life taught him a hard lesson and he made the best out of it. Thats worth at the very least applauding.

\--------------------

i say ALLLLL of this under the notion of Forever and Always...Fuck.The.Steelers"
"You‚Äôre preaching to the choir posting this here. I‚Äôm happy for his road to recovery personally, but as a player I will not miss him"
As a man I'm glad he's healthy and not paralyzed. As a football fan i'm glad he's the fuck off the field and that has honestly 0 to do with him being a Steeler. He played dangerous as fuck year in and year out and his tackling style is among the worst you can possibly have in football.
"He perfected his tackling techniques at Ohio State.  The coaches had ample opportunity to correct him.  The Steelers allowed him to continue, and his leading with his helmet was glorified as ‚Äúgreat hits‚Äù.   Glad that he can lead a normal life, even better that he can‚Äôt harm anyone else in the NFL."
Tbh I wouldn't blame Ryan as much as I would the defensive coaching and the entire Steelers organization that prioritizes violence and cheap shots. He was taught to hit like that from the Pittsburgh coaches because almost all of them pull this type of shit. Wonder why there are so many injuries in Steeler games? They like a dirty game.
Unpopular in all subreddits but one lol
"Loved him as a Buckeye, hated him as a Steeler."
"Admired maybe, idolized is a stretch but I guess so.. But should he be looked at as an example of how to play the game? Hell no."
"""You get what you fucking deserve. BANG""

-Joker"
"You said all this much better than i would except i dont wanr him coaching at all, he will be the next jerry porter talking shit on the field when hes not a player in a playoff game and theres goes joes first playoff win"
"Yeah, fuck that guy."
"I think that Steelers Bengals rivalry was the most intense rivalry in the nfl, I don't think the rest of the league understood how intense those games were, where Burfict gets hit by JuJu and comments will say good what a bitch he deserves it. I think the Bengals are such a small market team that the rest of the league didn't take notice, but that rivalry is the most intense to me. I see other rivalry games and they're like normal games, but Bengals Steelers would always end in multiple injuries because everyone wanted to hurt each other."
NFL has to idolize him because he was majorly disabled by their own league. Would look shitty on their part if they didn't give him some attention after suffering such an injury. Fuck him tho.
You're not wrong but that's not an unpopular opinion on this sub
"The only takeaway from the Shazier's retirement should be ""Don't lead with your helmet kids."" I'm a lifelong Buckeye fan but fuck Ryan Shazier forever. He didn't play that dirty at OSU so that's coached on the Steeler's side. He danced on the sideline when he injured Gio. He played to hurt people and in turn got hurt."
Not an unpopular opinion here. Fuck Ryan Shazier
"I dont remember the Bernard hit, I do remember when he got hit and being scared because I always liked watching him play same with Burfict. Maybe Shazier was cocky then but ut kind of sounds like he sees his error now that he got hurt."
"It has always been weird to me the tone of Shazier's situation. It's never been a cautionary tail with highlights of him trying to spear people with his helmet..instead always a heroic tribute. I wish his situation on no one, and his recovery has been great. He should be spearheading a movement for why play like his is bad for the league."
Yup you‚Äôre not the only one. I said the same exact thing today and I‚Äôve been saying it since it happened. Glad someone else is bringing this up too
I‚Äôve been saying this all day. Dude was good and it was unfortunate what happened to him but he was a dirty ass player.
Its torture watching him getting all this praise
"As a fan of OSU, I knew it was only a matter of time before he caused significant injury to himself or or others. He was booted from games multiple times for targeting at OSU. He has a poor technique that he never corrected. He played professionally and should have adjusted his technique. He definitely does not deserve praise. He was lucky that's all."
"While i do agree his form was terrible,  he was a good player,  whose career was cut short due to an injury while playing the game.  Your driving comparison would be spot on for nascar/f1 drivers. Anybody that gets hurt doing what they love, and attempts to fight back to do that job again should be looked up to as an inspiration for anybody that gets injured. 

Again,  was his tackling form poor and led to his injury? Yes. Does that mean he shouldn't still be an inspiration? No."
This ain‚Äôt it chief

Get a big outdoor antenna and mount it on end of house or a 20 ft pole if you are within 30 miles from transmitter. Sometimes farther with right antenna.
"It's an annoying problem.  I don't look at Twitter, but I often have to mute my phone so I can't hear text messages coming in.  Your only option is DirecTV if you want to eliminate delay.

Satalite likely your only option

"While watching games for our upcoming week 1 matchup I was interested to see what pass sets the Chargers ran last year. I found three different plays that I think the Chargers will try to run again this year and probably at least once or twice next week. This is part 2 of my look into Shane Steichen, the new offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers. [For my look into the crack toss click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bengals/comments/iorp8i/film_analysis_on_the_chargers_crack_toss/). 

Now switching gears from the ground game to the air game. The Chargers passed the ball at an extraordinary rate last year (63.29% which is 6th in the league right behind us) and I found there to be a few plays that kept reoccuring under their new OC. These plays were used to get their great playmakers in space and/or utilize mismatches they would find presnap or in the opponents coverage. The first of these three plays I will talk about will be the most recognizable: [the slip screen](https://insider.afca.com/xs-os-running-back-slip-screen/). In Steichen's [slip screen](https://streamable.com/id8oz2) both the play side and back side offensive tackles will [kick slide](https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2012/7/30/3199265/basics-of-pass-blocking) like in normal pass protection. This will key to the defense that it is a normal pass play rather than a screen. The interior of the offensive line (IOL) then gets ""beat"" letting that penetration through so they are freed up to get infront of the back to block. The running back will step up to the middle as if he is giving help in pass protection, but instead of blocking he will turn and run with the IOL. The QB holds the ball and waits for everything to be set before tossing it over the defensive line and into the RBs hands. This is a play that is very common in the NFL especially when you have a running back like Ekeler. Ekeler has a great set of hands and is slippery in the open field. They would run this play [to the opposite side of where the RB was positioned](https://streamable.com/ot5hs6) and to the [same side.](https://streamable.com/txbnsi) This makes it so the defense won't really be keyed in on either side as the possible slip screen, so they must always be prepared for it. New acquisition and 5 time probowler Trai Turner will be one of the leading blockers on this play and he comes with experience since he just blocked for Christian McCaffrey last year. However there is no need to fret, because [one way to stop this is for your DL to recognize and run down the line to make the stop](https://twitter.com/WillieCashmore/status/1283139784345563137?s=20).

The next pass play I am going to take a look at is one from an empty formation which is not the same as 00 personnel. Last year they typically ran the play from 21 personnel (two running backs and one tight end) but they may change that to 11 or 12 personnel due to the loss of Gordon. The [play always went the same](https://streamable.com/baf24q): [jet motion](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/10/30/18040534/jet-sweep-motion-play-rams-chiefs-offenses) Gordon for a fake handoff, clearout the defense with deep routes, then Ekeler runs a drag to get in space. It's a fairly common play when you have a great receiving back who can work in space like an Austin Ekeler. Leaving a CB in to cover him is probably overkill because you need those guys for the WRs while leaving a LB on him is exactly what they want because the LB will not be able to keep up with him on the play. [One way to defeat this play is to get pressure fast which with Sam Tevi starting at LT is possible.](https://streamable.com/kjm96k) While the other way is to play [match coverage](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2018/11/08/the-match-game-part-2-how-nick-saban-re-imagined-defensive-coverage/2/) which is essentially a mixture of zone and man where a defender will sometimes (depending on route combination) pass off their man and take over for someone else. When seeing the Ekeler drag a defender could pass him down the line and switch to playing someone else.

The last of my plays will however take advantage of a defense trying to play match. [This play](https://streamable.com/mewtrk) is a [whip route](https://qb-4-life.blogspot.com/2010/07/bladewhip-route.html) from a 3x1 set (3 receivers to one side with 1 receiver on the other). The 3x1 forces a defense to provide extra support to the 3 side or strong side. The 1 side or weak side is then typically left with just one or two defenders to play against and that defender often [essentially plays man coverage against him.](https://matchquarters.com/2017/06/09/defending-3x1-formations-solo-coverage/) Due to this knowledge the Chargers will have the weak side receiver run a whip route against this manned up defender because it's near impossible to defend from him. If the defender tries to cheat it they are giving up an easy slant, but if they are going to try to play inside against the slant portion they are going to get toasted on the whip portion of the route. This is something to watch for not only with a WR, but also with Hunter Henry if he gets matched with a linebacker. [If you have followed along you might be able to guess that the Raiders are playing match coverage here](https://streamable.com/zx5liu). One way you can tell is that the defender originally on Henry has great leverage, but thinks this is a slant, so he points to the linebacker and then moves to take away the crosser behind him. This whip is one way to exploit match coverage, because it puts a defender in a bind of split second decision making. They have to decide whether to pass him off or stay with him. Like I mentioned in the last paragraph passing him could be beneficial because he is unable to stay with him if it is a short crossing route, but as you see here if they break back out the switching defender is now stuck trying to chase him. 

These are all the offensive plays I would look out for on Sunday. Next I plan on going into the defense the Chargers will play and how their great defensive line likes to play. I appreciate any feedback you guys could give me, if you want additional learning resources, or if you need me to break something down further! I know this one was a big one so thanks for staying with me to the end if you made it."

"Hello friends,

I am in a predicament for Sunday and I was wondering if anyone else also experiences this and knows a way around it. 

I live in Columbus and my local CBS station is only airing 1 game on Sunday, the Browns game. Looks like in our area only Cin-Day-KY are getting Bengals/Chargers (per 506sports). 

I‚Äôm willing to pay for a subscription service to be able to watch the Bengals on Sunday, but I don‚Äôt necessarily want to purchase now without knowing if I‚Äôll be able to watch on Sunday or not. 

Any help is much appreciated. Who Dey!"
"Yes a service like Sunday ticket will get you out of market games. You just don‚Äôt get in market, or Thursday/Sunday/Monday night games through it 

Can try streams alternatively"
There's a new club supposed to meet up at the RnR Bar & Grill in Hilliard.  I'll probably be there for the TNF if they have game audio.
I'll let you know the feed i find. I am in cbus too.
I haven‚Äôt paid for cable in years and I never miss a game. There‚Äôs *cough* ways to watch them on places like twitch. Maybe *cough cough* google nfl streams.

"As a fellow Columbus-located fan, I too have been debating Sunday Ticket. I tried looking into a more powerful antennae but the Dayton stations are just too far away (I live near Westerville). 

My rationalization on the Sunday Ticket cost right now is that I won‚Äôt be going to any football games this season (NFL or college) so even at $300 that‚Äôs still cheaper than what I usually spend on football in a regular year...

Also for that Thursday night game, I‚Äôm doing a free trial of Fubo which includes NFL network. Just cancel before the 7 day trial ends."
Thanks everyone. I‚Äôll probably just end up biting the bullet and shelling out that Sunday Ticket cost.

"Well, well, well. We meet again. Welcome back to football, gents. And, of course, welcome back to my totally serious and factually accurate posts that are guaranteed to predict each and every game in extreme detail. 

Anywho. Who's the first to fall beneath the weight of the mighty Joe Burrow?

**Week 1: The ~~San D~~ LA Chargers**

Ah, yes. The chargers. You know what I love about them? The fans. They're always thinking ahead. Hell, they've been practicing for the pandemic by not showing up to home games since 2018. Such a considerate bunch. 

So, you may be asking yourself: what are the key factors to this game? How will we calculate the final score? How can people still not believe it's not butter when it's printed right there on the container?

Simple, folks. 

We start with what everyone's been talking about.
The buzz of the league. No one's quite sure how it will go, but most are pretty optimistic. Even fans of other teams will be tuning into the Bengals game to see exactly what happens.

I'm talking, of course, about Giovanni Bernard's mustache. 

(Side note - I have it on no authority that there have been serious discussions about replacing the entire o-line with Gio's 'stache. No one's getting passed that thing. No one.)

So, let's run the numbers, shall we?

Gio is 5'9"", and his mustache has a wingspan of 6 feet, or 72 inches. Now, at a diving speed of 104mph, the mustache is faster than a bald eagle by at least 5. It's call also screens freedom, unlike an actual bald eagle, which sounds [like shoes squeaking on a basketball court](https://youtu.be/hlq2kcYQcLc). 

(You thought I was lying before you clicked that link, didn't you?)

So, the math. Yeah, I know. Math bad. Don't worry, I'll do it for you. So the mustache wingspan divided by the bald eagle superiority factor (72√∑5) comes out to 14.4. 

Now, the Chargers do not have anyone wearing the number 14. Since our decimal is less than .5, we will go for the next lowest number: 13. That is worn by Keenan Allen. 

Last year, Keenan Allen had 6 touchdowns. That accounts for 17.6% of the touchdowns in his entire career. Hold on to that number, we'll need it later. 
Next up, consider that there are 8 letters in the word ""mustache"". If you recall from earlier, gio's mustache has a diving speed of 104 mph. Divide, peasants. That's a clean 13.

So! Take that 13 and add one Gio (25) and you'll get 38. That's our score. As for them? Well, remember that percentage from earlier? 17.6% of 38 is 6.68, which we will round up to 7 because we're feeling generous. 

There you have it. Good to be back, isn't it?

**Final Score: Bengals 38, Chargers 7**

*See ya when I see ya.*"
I cannot tell you how much I've missed this
A perfect prediction. Thanks for the fun writeup.
The prophet has returned!

"I hate the steelers for many reasons.  The two biggest (aside from their dirty play):

1. Growing up as a young boy, through getting my college education in the Cincy area and SW Ohio, I was surrounded by far more Steelers fans than Bengals.  In fact, it was actually pretty rare that I would encounter a fellow Bengals fan.  I followed the team as a young fella because my dad would watch them from my earliest childhood memories, and they were a pretty surefire way to have a good time with an otherwise less-than-pleasant dad - even if the Bengals were getting destroyed.  Which happened a lot during my early childhood years in the 90s.   Point here is that even in Bengal territory, I felt not only like I was one of the only Bengals fans I knew - but I felt like anyone I knew was on the Bettis train and was all about the Steelers despite never having been to Pittsburgh. 

2.  Fast forward a couple of decades, now in STL.  I've seen two Bengals fans on one occasion and Buffalo Wild Wings during a Steelers game a couple years back (we lost of course).  I have, however, seen an uncountable number of Steelers fans.  Steeler bumperstickers, jerseys, everywhere.  Without being a jerk, I try to see if these people are from Pittsburgh (which is forgivable in my opinion, nothing wrong with supporting your local team.  In fact this is the idea behind this second point) .  Just like back home, these Steelers ""fans"" generally have no connection to the city and choose to support a dirty football team based on what I can only assume is a history of success because, let's face it, they have a longstanding culture of success.  Built on dirty hits, steroids, and favor amongst the refs (this last one might just be in my head) .

I have been typing for a while and may have meandered from my original point.  

TLDR if the revolutionary war were about to break out 99% of Steelers fans would be on the wrong side of history.  I do, personally, exclude those who live in and around Pittsburgh, can't fault someone for being loyal to their own."
"I just love that I hate our entire division SO much. I think rivalries can be personal just as much as an overall team official rivalry. For instance, I hate the Browns the most because all of my life most of my friends are die hard fans. They‚Äôre also a dirty trash city that had an undeserved chip on their shoulder because they were great before the NFL. Most arrogant sack of shit fan base in America at least the Steelers and ravens have rings to back up"
"My ex (who has tied me up in court for over a year now over custody) is from Shitsburgh. 

Fuck the Steelers lol"
"Rivals are made not proclaimed. If it happens it happens, until then we have enough bad blood with the Steelers to last a while."
You should because they were founded by Art Modell and Mike Brown should hate him
Pittsburgh will remain our #1 rival. We must make Pittsburgh see that we are theirs.

It‚Äôs a shot. I took it last year and he put up good numbers for me until he got hurt.
They aren‚Äôt going to double Green. I‚Äôm a chargers fan and I‚Äôve rarely if ever seen the chargers double any receiver no matter how good. Especially with 3 all pro corners
Ross came out firing week 1 last year.

"Hey dudes, got the first of 16 tailgate-at-home-covid-edition and can‚Äôt think of good Bengals themed appetizers. Bonus points if it incorporates cincy food like skyline or grills.
Gotta bring in Burrow right, even if we can‚Äôt be there."
"When we tailgate we always do a dish from the opposing team. KC we BBQ‚Äôd, Pittsburgh we made Primanti knock-offs, etc.

I know it‚Äôs not the Cincy theme you asked for but it‚Äôs a fun way to mix things up"
Sharpie stripes onto some baby carrots
Just shot gun cans of chili
"Just get a shit load of rhinegeist and skyline, thats what im doing"
"Cincinnati chili! I always kick off the year by making a nice big pot of it (I have a recipe that tastes very similar to skyline, best home recreation I‚Äôve had), shredding the cheese by hand fresh, dice up an onion, and make hot dogs and spaghetti for people to pick what they want. I make it in the morning so that by lunch time it‚Äôs ready to eat and then people can just eat on it all day as they get hungry. It doesn‚Äôt get more Cincinnati than that!

I also like to make buffalo chicken dip. Not really Cincinnati exclusive but it‚Äôs fucking good and it‚Äôs the color orange? Lol"
Make some tiger dogs! You just take hot dogs and wrap each one with crescent roll dough and bake em.

Joe Burrow Energy > BDE
I think next 1-3 seasons. BURROW SZN HERE!
"Hypothetically if Burrow is somewhat legit, I honestly think we could win one next year. FO did a great job bringing in guys on defense, and we have a crazy solid WR Corp + Mixon/Gio on offense. Looking at 1 year contracts, if any rookie LBs are good enough to replace Bynes, we resign Alexander or replace him somehow, and find a RT through the draft, we have a solid group next year."
This year.
"My honest opinion on this, none of that  biased bullshit I say all the time?

Next year.

I think we're going to be good this year, but I would be really surprised if we got to 8 wins. With that said, I feel like 1 year of experience with Burrow, an extra year of experience for Zac, and some off season moves to tighten up any issues we have this year (probably offensive line) then we should be a good enough to actually win a playoff game. We're trending upwards, we just have to see how high we can go.

Who Dey! Fuck the steelers!"
"They really need it to be in the next few years before they lose guys like Geno, Green, and Dunlap who are arguably among their best impact players. Winning while Burrow is on his rookie deal is their best bet."
"Well the Bengals discovered such a thing as Free Agency exists this past offseason. If Burrow develops the way he can, and we continue to plug holes in FA, it'll happen fairly soon imo."
Next year... always next year.
"We get a playoff win this year. Its happening, mark it.  Out in round 2, but we get the W."
Hopefully once the offensive line gets straightened out. We‚Äôll see how they are this week. The defense still needs some work but it is trending in the right direction. I‚Äôd say within the next four years is a good estimate.
"Mike Brown has been in charge since 1992, we haven‚Äôt won a playoff game since 1991

That seems fairly relevant"
"2022.  If burrows is as good as we hope, he still needs 2 full seasons for experience, learning the offense and reading the defenses he is going to see."
"I question the viability of the NFL to get to January this year without a bubble system. 

So, next year. Burrow is our savior."
"Saints/LSU fan here but just wanted to stop in and say Joey B is the fuckin MAN and I can‚Äôt wait to watch him in the Pros. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, Joe already earned his stripes, and once a Tiger always a Tiger, so if you guys will have me, I plan to lurk some this season and beyond. I expect Joey v. Lamar to be one of the premier QB matchups for years to come and I‚Äôm even more hyped after watching Clyde run around Houston‚Äôs defense like schoolyard kids in his first pro outing. I honestly believe based on watching him develop for two years at LSU, and re-watching a lot of his film, that Joe is the kinda guy that can legitimately change your franchise if he‚Äôs given the tools to succeed. Couldn‚Äôt be more excited for Joe and for you guys that get to watch him. Haven‚Äôt ordered my Joe Bengals Jersey just yet but it won‚Äôt be long now. He got us a ring and you can too! 
Much love from the Deep South! 
Who dat and Who Dey baby!"
"Fellow LA native here. You‚Äôre always welcome. If the Saints never got Brees, they‚Äôd be on pretty much the same exact franchise path as the Bengals. The two organizations have never really been that different. We‚Äôre hoping that Joey B can be our Drew. *I* believe he will be. Who Dey! Let‚Äôs Geaux."
"As soon as I hear other people are getting their jerseys (November eta for all), I'll put my color rush jersey order in."
Good post:) Its been really nice feeling like im not the only bengals fan on the gulf coast recently.
We are beyond hyped and we welcome all new fans with open arms here! It seems like the franchise is slowly headed in the correct direction and has plenty of help at the skill positions. We do need to get better protection for him though and I‚Äôm sure we will after this season.

Randomly getting in Canada (BC) this weekend. Usually never get any Bengals games unless they're in prime time.

"It is mind boggling that the local Columbus affiliate is opting for an NFL postgame show and bull riding over the Bengals opener.

I get it, there are lots of Browns and Steelers fans in town (cough...fuck the Steelers....cough) but in what world does a Bengals game draw fewer viewers in Columbus than talking heads and bull riding."

I voted too quickly - thought it was first completed pass.  First TD pass is to Mixon.  First completed pass is to Boyd.
I feel like Taylor is gonna try and get Ross behind the cover 3 early. I think burrow will hit him in stride for the first TD of the game from Chargers 45.

Welcome to inevitable pain! I hope joe can deliver us from evil... :)
Now you need some Burrow Bengals gear and it'll be perfect
This gives me so much hope and pride
I think I‚Äôll care more about the Bengals this year than Saints. I‚Äôm emotionally drained from losing in terrible fashion 3 years in a row.
He shall fulfill the prophecy!

"Washington Football Team fan here ( I know I know, laugh ) 

Wow Joe looks great out there. You guys should be proud. This team deserves it. Totally bs call with Aj Green, but don‚Äôt worry about it. The future looks bright for you guys and I‚Äôm all here for it. Also, Mixon needs a better upgrade behind him. Good luck!"
Thanks for the support but Joe has a great back up in Giovanni Bernard!
I actually listened to your guys' game vs the Eagles. Helluva comeback and victory. Scared to death of your D.
Calling an obvious OPI call isn‚Äôt really BS but yeah Joe looked pretty nutty that last drive
Also why didn‚Äôt they get Tyler Boyd involved yesterday? I started him on my fantasy team lol. What potential does he have?
"Fuck Bobby Hart and fuck the Steelers. Goodnight boys. Today fucking sucked but Joe looked great, especially the last drive. Zac should have gave him the ball."
"Burrow graded himself a D. Said the TD run meant nothing because of the loss. 

He got the ball from the TD. You may not know, but the losing team does not hand out game balls. This isn't the participation ribbon era of school.

So I ask again. Who replaces Hart in the line-up ? You never answered that question, but you were quick on that downvote button, which explains why you hide your scores. I mean if I can help, the choices are Fred Johnson {1 start} or taking Knipfel off the PS. Andre Smith opted out so there won't be a 4th or 5th time seeing him again.

Your buddy Zac sure stacked the deck with RT. At least we got another WR in the 2nd round.. We were sure hurting there !!! Yay !!!"

"I'm assuming this is Randy? It sucks he missed that field goal, but he did get 54% of points on the board yesterday lol...still feels bad"
"I just wonder why he isn‚Äôt one of the best kickers in the league. Guy was hyped up in college but hasn‚Äôt really done much as a pro. 

Also, how can he be so big?"
What‚Äôs the point of this? You don‚Äôt like him as a kicker and think he‚Äôs out of shape. Okay move on with your life. No one is posting a picture of you and ridiculing you. Shits just weird.
"Some of y'all on here are absolute shit bags. Lay off the guy, happens."

There‚Äôs no transition from his neck to his chin
"I (31) have been a fan since I was 5.  I remember going to games at riverfront wondering why we played on a baseball field.  I remember how shitty it was in the 90s.  I remember the dick labeau 2-14 season.  This isn't that.  This is week 1 with a rookie QB who had no preseason.  Would anyone who sees another comment or post about ""that's just Bengals football"" get them the heck outta here.  You don't live in Cleveland!"
"No true Scotsman.  Must be tiring with all that gate keeping.  Honestly if you're a ""real"" fan you were probably bummed out that the loss was as unfortunately painful as it was considering the context surrounding the game, and are likely to say all kinds of things just from the sheer outrageousness of what unfolded last night and how it did unfold."
"what you are talking about have nothing to do with what kind of fan they are but what kind of person they are. those are just a loser who give up easily but they are still a Bengals fan.

there is only 2 kind of fan that you can tell if they are true fan or not. the true fan is the one who support one team their whole life. I like Bengals when I was kid because I love Tiger and Orange is my favorite color and here I am 42 yrs old now and still a Bengals fan, so I am one of true fan. those fake fans is the one who keep on changing team thur their life."
"Get bent if you think that you have to act a certain way, or have a certain attitude to be a real fan. I am a couple of years older than you, I was a baby in a carrier at a Superbowl party in 88. I don't have any memories of this team having any true success.

I expect to lose, I expect this front office to fuck up, and to be honest I would not be that surprised if Cincinnati no longer has an NFL team whenever Mike Brown decides that PBS needs to be replaced.

All that said...The more we lose the faster we can hopefully fire Zac Taylor and get a real coach. Nobody can tell any of us how to fan."
Upvote for the sam wyche (rip) quote.
"I'm forty and have been a fan since the Boomer and Ickey years. I have suffered every low and every high. I named my first cat Boomer and still hold my Corey Dillon Jersey with pride.

Stop gatekeeping. Fans have a right to be upset and this franchise hasn't done much to garner goodwill."
[removed]
Seems pretty big for a team that just got absolutely fucking smoked.
"I wish they had been more competitive honestly, now we get them backed into a corner. 

Imo the line seems right. They are being given a semi pass for week 1 as a new system/coach with no preseason, against a top team. On paper their talent is solid and will push their lines until they rack up a bunch of L‚Äôs. Additionally the chargers seem really bad/we didn‚Äôt do much well. I‚Äôm praying for a W but this will definitely be a tough game to grab"
"What do the browns do best?  Run the ball.  What do the bengals do Worst?  stop the run.  If the browns were smart, I'd expect them to run Hunt and Chubb 20 times each.  And the only way that doesn't happen is if the Bengals rookie QB-with-a-terrible-offensive-line-coming-off-no-preseason-and-on-a-short-week leads them to go up to 2 scores early.  So yea I can see 6 points."
Veteran team that‚Äôs why. Plus isn‚Äôt it in Cleveland?
"It‚Äôs because the Browns were smoked by the Ravens in their 14th(?) straight win, which was to be expected

That said, one of these so far incompetent coaches are getting a win on Thursday."
its not big. bengals are bad until they prove otherwise.
"If the 6 point spread doesn't motivate the team then I don't know what will. It is a deliberate sign of disrespect. I watched the Cleveland game, they look like total shit! So, they are saying we are even bigger shit with the spread. Again, if that doesn't motivate the team to fight their asses off for a win and put it together, then nothing will."
Can we talk about how awful the bengals simulated crowd noise was. It sounded like shitty robots. I watched a lot of games flipping the channel around during the 1 o clocks and none were close to being that bad.
"Cant stand the fake crowd noise on any of the games. Soccer or football or hockey.  

its just weird.  I know there are no fans and its just some dude in the booth controlling the sound. I hate it.  

I wish they could just turn on the field mics and let us hear the players and the hits and such."
Honestly it seemed like they cranked it the loudest when we we were driving in that final 2 minutes
I desperately wanted fake crowd boos whenever there was a penalty against the Bengals. I was so disappointed.
The crowd noise is in the broadcast it‚Äôs not in the stadium so the bengals didn‚Äôt control it cbs did.
"How I understand it, the crowd noise was generated from CBS/Fox. So whatever you heard for us you heard for everyone else as well."

##Remember to give reasons (stats, explanation, etc)  

We'd like encourage a format:

**Offense/Defense/Special Teams** - Player Name: Reasons"
Special Teams: Kevin Huber
"I'm going to go out on a limb here 


Offense: uzoomah really stepped up,and helped us make a lot of plays.


Defense: obviously bates look forward to seeing him the rest of the season."
"Burrow

Bates
(Honorable mention Josh Bynes: had some clutch run stuffs and was making plays to keep us in it)

Huber did great."
Jessie Bates
"Defense: Bates
Offense: Burrow
ST: Huber"
"Offense: AJ Green - wiiiiide open on the deep ball before the half that Joe air mailed. He played very well despite facing all-pro level CBs in Casey Heyward and Chris Harris jr. Hard to pick someone on offense because they all had bad moments from AJ's push off to Joe's missed deep passes and terrible interception.

Defense: Jessie Bates easily I think. He was making run stops from the deep safety position, broke up a TD to Hunter Henry is man to man, and made some huge hits that were unjustly called unnecessary roughness.

Special Teams: Huber got screwed on 2 or 3 punts from his gunners. He hit them perfectly around the 5 yard line or closer and they would miss it and let it go to the end zone."
"Offensive: Joe Burrow - Put us in a position to win the game.  
Defensive: Germaine Pratt - Felt like he was everywhere. Also led the team in tackles.  
Special Teams: Kevin Huber - Excellently placed punts which should've been pinned back inside the 5"
"Offense - Joe Burrow: Stood tall in the pocket when it was clean. Made a couple hasty decisions leading to the fumble and the INT but overall he seemed very cool and collected. He had no problem calling his own number when he saw a defensive lineup he liked and he ran through them like a man.


Defense - Jesse Bates: the man got rung up on two different BS helmet-to-helmet calls, one of which had 0 helmet contact and the other was equally initiated by the ball-carrier trying to duck as Jesse went low. The man was everywhere on the field and made his presence known. Honorable mention: WJ3: great coverage and tackling.

Special Teams: Kevin Huber. His great punts helped us win the field position battle  despite our offense failing to execute most of the game. He's been down on yardage the past 3-4 years and yesterday he kicked the fuck out of the ball."
"Burrow (obligatory)

Jessie Bates 

Huber. If we could down them, he was on point"
"Defense: Josh Bynes- I heard his name a lot last night, and this is the first game I can remember in a long time where I felt like LB wasn't a glaring weakness."
Defense: Jessie Bates
William Jackson: Dude was a blanket playing like a #1 corner all day.
Offense: Billy Price. He actually looked pretty good in the relief role as the offensive line as a whole played much better in the 2nd half. Honorable mention to Joe Burrow for the last drive alone.
Defense: Everybody is talking about Jessie who had a great game but I want to put Josh Byrnes' name out there. He made plays consistently all over the field and brought a lot of leadership and confidence to the linebacking group that was mostly young guys. Honorable mention to Pratt who was in on a lot of plays and made several tackles.
"O- Uzomah
D- WJ3
ST- Huber"
"Offense: Green for me, I will admit it was hard for me to pay attention to anyone on offense because all I was doing was watching Burrow. 

ST: Huber this one is not surprising tbh, he is always money

Defense: This one is tough, Bates, WJ3, Bynes, Reader? man there were quite a few really good players out there!"

Special Teams Player of the Week: Huber. That man was punting the best I've ever seen him. He should have had a couple pinned in the 10 if the gunners made a play.
"The fact that I‚Äôm thinking of Bates, Reader, Bynes, and WJ3 as potential defensive candidates brings me joy."
One player per comment
Offense: Trey Hopkins. His block on the Burrow run alone earned him the award IMO.
"Special teams-Kevin Huber, he was hitting some really good balls yesterday and really helped with field position"
"Defense: Jessie Bates. Man was allover the field. Loved his energy, his couple flags were bad calls imo."
offense: Joe Burrow
"Offense: Gonna go with a weird one here. Billy Price. The offensive line did not give up a sack after Price came in for Sua Filo. He looked solid, impressed me and I expected little to nothing out of him. Not many other deserving players. Burrow looked like a rookie. Mixon fumbled. AJG got called for the OPI."
"Defense-Josh Bynes, 8 total tackles, 1 sack. Played great and was nice to see considering our lb play last year"
Everything: Joe Burrow.
Special Teams: Kevin Huber had a great day punting the ball and could have easily had 3 balls pinned inside the 5 if our gunners had made plays.
"Offense: Burrow, He showed the clutchness to pull us down the field when needed the most.

Defense :Reader, The D went down noticeably whilst he was out

ST: Huber, His punts were brilliant. Consistently one of the best in the league."
"Just wanted to give an outsiders perspective :

1) Burrow is going to be fantastic.  He had no offseason and already looks like a playmaker. Poor dude will need a RT at some point who can protect him though.

2) O-Line. A lot of O-lines looked aweful. Ours (Texans) due to poor coaching.  Your coach was installing an offense with a rookie QB. Also, this was Jonah‚Äôs first game right? He will get there.  He looks strong as hell. 

3) AJ Green is back! Saw a drop or two deep but he and Joe will get into a rhythm. Can‚Äôt wait.  Also.... I love they Tee Higgins NFL Comp during the draft was AJ Green. Haha.  Maybe it will be like the young and old wolverine in Logan! 

4) DJ Reader is gong to be an animal in Cincy.  I saw the injury scare but sounds like he‚Äôs ok.  DJ was quietly the best defensive player pound for pound outside of maybe Justin Reid.   He‚Äôs got a great attitude and work ethic.  If Geno is slipping (seemed off yesterday) then give it a few games of Reader outshining him...it will bring out the best in Geno. 

5) You need some more play out of your TEs. A young QB needs a reliable TE to dump off too when pressured like he was.  Admittedly I‚Äôm naive about your TE roster and maybe you‚Äôre set there? 


Good luck this season.  I‚Äôm a Burrows fan already even if he looks alarmingly like Jim Breuer in Half Baked!


Edit : Thanks guys, guess I had a brain fart and assumed that was Geno, but now I know why he seemed off!!! ü§£"
"I agree, Geno seemed like a completely different guy out there."
"Agree with just about all of that, but for the record, Geno didn‚Äôt play yesterday."
"Most of what you said I agree with. As far as Geno goes, he was actually out. He suffered a small injury last week and I don‚Äôt think they wanted to risk him as he was day to day all week. 

TEs - not exactly our strong suit, but they did spend a second round pick last year on Drew Sample which I think they‚Äôll start getting him involved more. The final drive saw a few throws to Uzomah, so I think it had more to do with Burrow finding some footing."
Yesterday even though we lost our future is super bright. Kinda had flashbacks to the Palmer early days. Burrow is a gamer he looked super cool on that last drive. The spotlight and the big moment is nothing to him.
"Even with rookie mistakes and a porous O-line, Joe did what he needed to do at the end of the game. If not for the penalty on A.J., the game was won. If not for the blown kick, the game was tied. There's a lot of good to take away from that game."
"You can tell a lot from how the team celebrates an individual player scoring and there were a lot of very happy people after Joe did his 23yrd scamper.
I'm an LSU fan as well as Bengals [I'm from Northern England, it's a long story] so I'm used to seeing Joe start picking apart a defence after a sustained period of pressure. He needs to O line to step up more, but the coaches need to scheme more when you've got two D line beasts like the chargers do. Too many times one of them was untouched.
Joe getting better after fucking up with that shovel pass is pretty normal too, he doesn't crawl back into his shell. He'll want to redeem himself with play. 
Think you all got sight of some of the throws he can make under pressure last night."
"Geno was so off it was like he wasn‚Äôt even there ü§£ all joking aside I agree with your assessments. We need to drop Bobby Hart and realize Joe is playing in his first game in an unprecedented offseason. He looked very impressive against a ferocious pass rush. Despite the loss I was impressed with him and our new players. 

FBH (F*ck Bobby Hart as a person and a player)

FTS"
Thanks!
Thanks for the kind words and motivation to stay positive but ya Geno Atkins didn‚Äôt play yesterday he was injured
"Even without Geno the defense is clearly improved - they play faster and they get to the ball. Of course nobody mistakes Tyrod for Peyton Manning, but still. Burrow will make his rookie mistakes but it seems to me he has it. Color me cautiously optimistic - this year is really about next year (stole that from a writer but it‚Äôs true)."
"They gave 50 million to DJ reader, they should have given 55M to Jack Conklin. Looking at the nfl the past 10 years. The only positions that matter much is QB, OL, and DB. The rest are irrelevant because you can find them in the draft year in and year out"
"I am not overly worried about the lose yesterday.  Joe is a rookie trying to learn a new system with no preseason and a questionable OLine.  I think he will do well against The Browns.  Then again who wouldnt.  But if we lose to the Browns I will be pretty upset.

I think Joe will be pretty damn good in the long run.  He will have some great flashes this season and he will have games where we are thinking Why the Hell did we draft this guy.  There will be a pretty big learning curve but he will be great.  I am still thinking I will be happy with 6 or 7 wins this season."
"Yeah we have the worst offensive line coach in the game, compounded by the fact that he's a terrible person"
""
"This is completely false, I deff trust that yellow gate more"
You‚Äôre giving him way too much credit. Maybe a parking cone would be more accurate
"There was one play, they showed a replay on.  It didn‚Äôt end up a sack, but Burrow was hurried.  Bobby Hart comes off the snap, let‚Äôs Bosa run right at Burrow while he looks right and no one is there for him to block.  Not sure if this was a protection audible, but I‚Äôd like to see Fred Johnson get a shot to play next week."
Should have been a pic of a trash can
Seems pretty effective considering grass is lava
Only true if the gate opens with a slight push as well

What about switching Hart and Bullock switching positions? Ryan is getting even chubbier and Hart is good at kicking us in the nuts üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I do love how Bobby was one of the first guys in the end zone to celebrate with Joe. It shows how much Hart loves him and going to try as hard as he can to protect him. 

If we can draft a RT, maybe we can slide Hart to RG in the future"
[deleted]
"Two things I saw that gives me hope:

1. Burrow wasn‚Äôt afraid to march down the field at the end of the game and win the damn thing against a well above average secondary. Despite the OPI, and whether or not it was justified, that‚Äôs something you either have or you don‚Äôt. 

2. Despite our OLs best efforts, Burrow kept plays alive. Hopefully with better OL play he can actually stay in the pocket and read the defense."
"You know what was nice, for the first time in a long time, every time our QB threw the ball, I didn‚Äôt get anxiety thinking it was going to be intercepted"

"Chargers gave a great dline, we have a bad online, and he still had 69 yards. Joe is going to be fine."
We went against one of the strongest Dlines in the NFL. Give it time bro.
"Be interested to see all his passes compiled, from what I saw he was doing a lot of shorter routes but missed on the deep balls slightly. 

All in all a good day given how much time he had back there. 
How about speed/velocity?
Deeper balls seems to float a lot but make them very catchable with the downward arc when accurate... anyone else observations ?"
Bengals website has a video of his best plays.
NFL YouTube has all his completed passes and runs. Would be nice to see his incompletions and sacks tho
[deleted]
Noticed it too. It was infuriating live.
"You aren‚Äôt misinterpreting the rule, they were definitely toeing the line. They easily could have been called several times for defensive delay of game."
Logical answer: Because we‚Äôre  the Bengals.
I saw at least 2 incidents that way. One guy literally just wrapped his arms around a guys ankles after the catch.
"It's too controversial to make a call like that....

but it's totally fine to make an OPI call with 7 seconds left when the WR is being held."
There was 2 egregious cases there at the end. If they took 5 seconds from us they cost us the game. 12 seconds would of been on the clock when we kicked. Would of allowed 1 or 2 more shots into the end zone.
But if the bengals players did it it would be called everytime.
"Yeah it was infuriating to watch live, but we can‚Äôt leave the game in the hands of the refs. Had multiple chances to put it away. That final drive has me excited for the rest of the season!"
Yeah i lost all respect for chargers and their fans (by default). Sideline catch and hes mounting him like its a highschool wrestling match. Should have been some penalties.
I was screaming at the TV .......They were totally holding them on the ground.....Bullshit!
This always happens in that scenario but they were really pushing it and it was pissin me off
"This happens everytime a team is trying to go into hurry up at the end of the game. Unless it's super egregious it's never going to be called. The defensive player doesn't have to immediately jump up after a tackle, it's not their responsibility to help the other team run their hurry up offense."
"Refs fucked us all game, we should of won."
"My biggest takeaway from the Chargers game is that Joe Burrow has balls of steel. He got hammered repeatedly in the first half and ran for his life. I believe a lot of us (myself included) were holding our breaths at halftime wondering if he would get even one clean pocket the rest of the game. 

His first sack was an ugly 14 yard loss where he looked like a true rookie. He was then sacked 2 more times and hurried/hit repeatedly throughout the half. 

In the 2nd half he was not sacked a single time and was also hit much less often. Outside of the interception his decision making was methodical and his adjustments were apparent. It took him 2 quarters to adjust to the speed of an NFL pass rush and it was very clear in the 2nd half that his presence in the pocket was much greater. He felt his blindside and stepped up with incredible poise. Add this to the list of his other savvy moves and we have ourselves a football savant on our hands. 

What are those other savvy moves?

Audibling into a QB draw when you see the box is empty and following the center like fucking prime Le'veon Bell. 

Running the 2 minute drill to absolute perfection. Honest to God, rookie or not, I don't think I've ever seen a team get lined up so quickly and into good plays. Seriously what the actual fuck he is a rookie?

What really took the cake is when he got the team lined up to snap the ball after the John Ross bobble. He ran it like he was a 10 year vet and the refs straight up hit him with a power move. I don't think any of us question whether Joe got that snap off (he clearly did) but the refs shut that shit down. Either way it was a ridiculous display of his presence of mind. 


On top of all this he was realistically a chip shot field goal away from putting together another legendary drive in overtime. 

When you consider the nature of this off-season it cannot be overstated just how truly prepared he looked. His hard count, the way he bounces up after big hits, holy-fucking-shit this dude is forreal. 

I've seen what I need to see. He is the chosen one. Bengals fans rejoice!"
"One thing that makes me feel better is that, yeah Burrow took that rookie-like 14-yard sack, but Baker is still taking those sacks in his 3rd year."
Im honestly so pumped for the rest of the year
"Two points I want to touch on. The first being the hurry up after John Ross' bobble, I've seen Andy try that multiple times throughout his career with us, try to snap the ball quick before the play could be reviewed, and I don't remember him ever getting the offense lined up in time, let alone into the next play and getting the ball snapped. Impressive.

The second being the hard count he forced a neutral zone infraction on. That just simply doesn't happen from a rookie signal caller. The command he has of that offense in year 1 is insane. Regardless of this season's outcome, I am excited for the future."
It really felt like some kind of hybrid preseason game. Once he got the feel of it things just seemed to start clicking. Also hats off to the defense which felt like were on the field the whole game.
"For real it was like he went from rookie to veteran in one game, it was crazy to witness. He looked like Brady/Manning commanding the team on the last drive, just willing them down there himself."
"Watch how quick he makes his reads. Looks a lot like Brees. You guys are in for a fun season if the coach can get him not to block! Bengals are now my second team after the Saints.

Geaux Tigahs."
"I agree, especially on the bouncing back up after big hits. He got CRUSHED a few times and jumped right up and wouldn't be intimidated. The kid is TOUGH.

So fucking glad Mike Brown wouldn't return Miami's draft trade calls cuz Tua would have already been out for the season."
thought Jonah did ok
Idk about the PFF grades but why don't the Bengals try out Fred Johnson or Hakeem Adeniji at the RT? they can't possibly be worse than Bobby Hart. Did Johnson get any snaps or no?
"I was trying to look at the PFF scores for our O-Linemen and I discovered that the PFF scores are behind a subscription. I'm curious if anyone has a subscription to PFF and thinks it's worth it? It's ~~only $40~~  **a whopping $200** for the year... I would think it's fairly easy to get your eyes on the PFF scores with some help from internet friends or by doing some digging.

In that same vein (assuming there aren't any rules against this) if anyone in this subreddit already has a subscription, I'm sure plenty of bengal-bros would appreciate you posting the scores on here. I'll be sure to give you some internet points."

As much as I hate randy - I hope he‚Äôs ok for Thursday. Do not want to see the result of us scrambling for a kicker in 3 days during Covid

"\#Bengals kicker Randy Bullock is undergoing tests, but the left calf issue that caused his late miss Sunday is ‚Äúnothing serious,‚Äù source said. Short week before Thursday‚Äôs game at Cleveland. They‚Äôll work out Bullock before then and have a Plan B if he can‚Äôt go.

I really hope we dont have to go Plan B. Randy isn't even close to being a great kicker but there's some seriously dogshit FA kickers floating around in the ether.
"CHAD JOHNSON, WE NEED YOU!"
Not gonna lie wouldn't mind working out a kicker. Not confident in a 100 percent Fat Randy don't even want to see a not healthy Fat Randy. Can I please get an average NFL kicker please?
"Here's why I dont blame him, sure it was a short field goal but he nailed a field goal earlier that wasn't easy (51 yards?) and overall the offense failed many times to put up points. I'm more than happy with the defense but Bullock didn't lose the game, as always it comes down to a couple plays."
Any chance they look for kickers? Id love to see the stats for how many wins he's cost us.
"Damn it, he Randy'd us!"
Dude is a joke.....some of you guys called it smh!
"Can we all agree that this weekend's game created a new phrase to use when someone has an over dramatic reaction, like faking an injury, to mask an embarrassing moment? Like...

""Oh, look at that, he pulled a Randy"" or,

""Oh, you know you are not hurt Johnny so get up off the ground and stop trying to pull a Randy!"" or,

""You dumb ass, that's not a broken leg, that's a mosquito bite. Now, stop trying to Randy me and get the hell back out onto the field!!"""
He wasn‚Äôt faking an injury. He literally injured both of his legs.
"> Can we all agree 

NO."
I'm pissed he missed it but I can respect him for taking it on the chin. He didnt shy from it he went to the media and told them what happened. He said he got a cramp mid kick. I'm pissed about it but at least he owns it.
I am personally into Matt Gay
"Put me in coach, I can kick a football over them mountains"
Ochocinco
"Vinatieri is a free agent, but he wasn‚Äôt great last year. And he‚Äôs older than dirt"
"I doubt anyone unless the injury is serious. The kickers in Free Agency are butt cheeks. 

Randy is by no means a good kicker but he consistently hits kicks under 50 and extra points. That's more than most kickers in FA can say. 

I mean the Browns just had to pick up Cody Parkey in free agency for gods sake."
Just let Burrow kick.
Jim Breech
"You

Edit: username check out"
The guy we had in training camp a few years ago that was on the U-18 US National Soccer team. John Brown I think his name was?
"Bullock has been well above average most of his career and one miss due to a mid kick injury is not any reason to go digging into free agency or anything.  If its a serious injury that will require more then 2 weeks of recovery then you go into FA which Kai Forbath or Matt Bryant would be the best options IMO.  That being said, the NFL is very strict on roster size, and everybody has a contingency plan for these things, I am sure that Taylor has a guy picked to kick fieldgoals if Bullock got hurt mid game, whoever that is will kick on Thursday.  I would not see them go shopping unless its a multi week thing."

"One played his first game in the pros, one has years of experience. It's ok to judge them differently based on that."
Burrow didn‚Äôt get laid the fuck out because of Jonah. Discussion over.
They did credit Bobby with 6 pressures... The next closest person had 3. So he did not do well.
I thought Williams held up pretty well  for his first ever NFL game against a pretty good DE in Ingram.
"When the biggest issue for this team this year is keeping Joe Burrow upright, then Jonah Williams had an infinitely better game than Bobby Hart. Williams needs to improve at run blocking according to PFF, but that‚Äôs not my biggest concern. Plus both guys should be graded on a curve. One was playing his first snap in any game in over a year and his first snap ever in the NFL. The other is an anti vaxxer."
"2nd to last column is pass blocking, which Williams was significantly better. I don‚Äôt know how many runs Bobby impacted, but I have to think those numbers are skewed (is Bobby getting credit for the Burrow TD run)?"
Is he actually as good at run blocking as his 81.2 would indicate? Cause thats a really good grade.
What are the columns?
The difference is one gave up colossal opportunities for injury to joe and/or turnovers. The other just played mediocre. I‚Äôll take the latter 10/10
"Pass blocking is way more important than run blocking though. An average pass blocking tackle we probably win that game. Better tun blocking from Jonan would have made not a lot of difference 


It seems the old school right tackle is a run blocker when basically all the best pass rushers in the NFL go against the right tackle so its actually ad important as left tackle."
Jonah had a rough first quarter then settled in. Bobby... Didn't.
Fans hate Bobby Hart and are optimistic on Williams. Not sure if we have the ability to be objective on Hart after all the suck.
I thought he was poor. Hopefully he learns quickly.
"He can't be any worse than ole Bobby, can he?"
"that's what I'm saying or even the rookie Hakeem. Everyone knows Hart is bad, yet they keep playing him.

How did the rest of the line look yesterday?"
Maybe Thursday in some capacity now that ZT just ruled out Xavier Sua'Filo for Browns game.
""
""
Sometimes I wonder if Cowherd even watched him in college

Price played pretty well in relief I thought
Saw on Twitter PFF had him at 75.5 but can't confirm
"I remember the Week 1 depth chart showed Calhoun as backup RG, but Price got the role yesterday. I wonder if that will be the same case Thursday"
Hypothetically speaking... (cuz I know neither team would ever do it) what would you give up to trade Justin Tucker to the Bengals? My answer is a 3rd round - maybe even 2nd round pick.
I hate these hypothetical trade posts
"I don‚Äôt think they would let him go for less than a 1st, and I still don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs enough. 

We know first hand how hard it is to find a good kicker, and they have the best kicker ever."
I would never do that If I was the Bengals GM
Don‚Äôt need him chad Johnson can be our kicker

"Yall need to chill, this is just insurance in case Randy can't go on Thursday."
I'm gonna laugh my ass off if Seibert goes like 3 of 3 and we win.
People calling to Axe Randy have to realize how hard it is to find viable kickers.  This dude missed 5 extra points last year!     It is not easy to find a replacement mid season.
"Makes sense, given the circumstances and COVID protocol."
I kinda wish they would just take a chance on an unproven youngster rather than continue to juggle dog turds.
What in WhoDey fuck is happening
"Hey guys. 

We have 2 days before Thursday...they have to pass through covid protocols and getting someone in state quickens the process. 

I really had faith that with a new QB and some hope it'd be less whiny around here..but here we are lol"
The bengals two weakest links contributed to the loss on Sunday. Bullock is one of those. The cardboard cutout at RT is the other.
Fuck Fat Randy!
Remember Jake Elliot?  I member
WHY
Why is everyone tripping over the kicker? After burrows last drive performance I rather have him finish the game off or go for it on 4th downs.
""
"How bad was kicking around the NFL in Week 1? 

- 19 missed field goal attempts. 
- five missed extra point attempts. 

Only one game (Packers v. VIkings) didn't have a missed kick of some sort.

Just throwing this out there for the people who think Bullock sucks. He's a solid kicker and those are harder to come by. Yeah it blows that he missed that kick but he's not a bad kicker by any means.
"Gotskowski dropped three ranks in the ""most accurate kicker of all time"" list just last night alone."
"I wonder how many open receivers were missed? How many fumbles? How many interceptions? Let's get rid of anyone that made more than 1 mistake! BTW, that means we keep our kicker and lose our QB."
""
He missed a chip shot but there really aren‚Äôt any better available options out there. Most kickers sucked this week.
"Honestly compared to other kickers we could have I'm content with Randy. 


Also, we have to remember he wasn't the only kicker that performed bad, I think there was at least 10 different kickers missing chip shots on Sunday. Even the chargers kicker missed earlier in the game."
Let's see your gut buddy and see you make a 50 yard FG.
"Fun fact, Randy is 43% (3 of 7) on game winning/tying kicks. Dude is not clutch."

Fans have been asking for updates for years and with the subtle nods on twitter towards new unis I could see the stadium getting renovated as well. They seem to realize that this is the last chance to hold on to the fanbase by what they've been doing all year long with free agency and the draft.
"Here's my wishlist for PBS:

* Bengals ring of honor

* Tear down the L-scalator

* New sound system

* Wood or faux-wood facades to cover all of the damn concrete

* Better concession options"
"They need a indoor practice facility, new uniforms"
PRACTICE STADIUM
"They‚Äôve tried an indoor practice field it was shot down due to zoning because of the bridge.


The next logical answer is to build a different facility then somewhere, but with the UC bubble a 5 minute drive away what‚Äôs the point?


The practice bubble is a dead horse."
They should upgrade the O-Line first
Please build a practice facility for the love of God
I understand the Jungle theme but I always thought the green seats look ridiculous and don't match our uniforms. Wish they go with black and orange seats.
Come on bubble...
"The interior club sections are a little bit dated and can be refreshed.  These area are perfect for being rented out for corporate events and receptions but right now the style is out of date.  


They need to get the escalators up to the 300 level working for every game.  Year after year I feel like after a tough loss I need to take the stairs down because the stupid escalator is broken on the west side of the stadium. There are fucking 10 games a year so these should work 10 out of 10 games.  


I'm curious if PBS would support overhangs similar to what they put in for Miami?  When it rains it sucks in the colder months.  


The bathrooms always have the paper towels dispensers broken.  I feel like by the end of the 1st quarter the machines are open and the paper towels roll are on top of the dispenser.

Spruce up the interior tunnels along the sideline seats.  I feel like these sections are pure concrete and could be spruced up.  I think Great American Ballpark is a good example of how to do it right."
My vote is to knock er down. Let a big company come in give them naming rights and have them foot  some of the bill.

That‚Äôs fine
when‚Äôs the last time cowherd was right? 1-1 ez
Fuck that guy.
Why do people pay him any attention? Shit like this is why he does what he does.
When Bill Simmons did guess the lines on his podcast he was flabbergasted that the line was -6 and said he thinks Cincy played better than Cleveland which makes sense when the Browns were blown out and Cincy was in it until the end.
Cowherd's opinion matters how? Dude is wrong all the time.
Who gives a shit about him. Stop feeding the trolls views.
I mean this take makes complete sense. Colin's been high on Baker since he got drafted.
Fine by me.  We can start talking shit when we start winning.
"The Browns are so bad, we‚Äôre gonna destroy them."
Who's surprised? The guy has no respect for this city. He's always underestimated us.
The line being -6 is disrespect. Our offense just faced the best pass rush and the best Secondary it‚Äôs gonna face all year..
"He may be right, though I'd wager we have the better QB.

In any case, their offensive line is 100% better than ours, and that's significant."
Dude's a chump

Ew.
Does anyone make good cover ups for the names? I'd get one for cheap and just turn it into a Rudi Johnson jersey.
I would pay up to $5 with free shipping for this
Would make good kindling
More valuable as fire starter
"In college I worked at Olympia Sports in Boston fairly close to Fenway park. When Johnny Damon ended up on the Yankees, we marked down the authentic $200 jerseys down to $10, and I still don‚Äôt think we sold very many."

"Is it sad that not only do I not hate the Browns (the Ravens are the real ""browns"" that deserve hate), but I actually sympathize with their fans. Baker Mayfield has a lot of potential, but it never seems to click. Something is definitely wrong with the organization, and as a Bengals fan I know exactly what that's like."

Loved your City doing the Flying Pig Marathon there a couple of years ago. One of the best marathons I ever ran as you ALL come out for that one.

"Always quite liked the Bengals tbf. You've got some dogs coming through on D in Bates and WJ3 to match the strong D-line. Have you sorted out the shit show that was the LB corps?

I think Jessie Bates is probably the most underrated player in the league."
"Does anyone else think it‚Äôs going to be a high scoring game this week? Neither team really has much going for them as a whole on defense outside of 2 solid D-lines, however, my bias says the browns are better being a browns fan. I think it‚Äôs going to be an air-raid game and each QB is gonna have 3+ passing TDs. Thoughts?"
"Who is looking like Burrow's favorite target?  Green seemed to be his go-to in game 1.  Do you see that continuing?  


Also, what was holding Mixon back last week?  His YPC were low and he wasn't used in the passing game much."
I love that i get to watch my Browns on Thursday Night. I hate that i dont get to watch them on sunday.

Our defense is awful. Baker is still struggling."
Is this a make-or-break year for Baker?

Brad, I love you man and hope you found peace in that great gridiron in the sky."
"How do you guys feel about the war in the trenches this week? Brown's had a fairly mediocre week against the Ravens, however Jackson is incredibly hard to take down. I thought Burrow handled his sacks relatively well, but looked like the speed of blitzes and pressure caught him off guard."

"My fantasy week 2 hinges biggly on AJ Green and more importantly Mixon. I'm praying to the football gods.

Also, why is Mixon not the 3rd down back? He seems more than capable to catch and run."
Did the Bengals get pressure on the QB in Week 1?
"If somehow the Browns end up with pick #1 in the 2021 draft, do you think they would take Trevor Lawrence or trade it anyway and stick with Baker?"
Let's put them out of their misery.

"Any word on how Billy Price graded out once he came in for XSF?  If he can get his game together, that would go a long way in fixing this line."

Goodberry:

PFF pressures for the Bengals OL

6 - Bobby Hart (1 sack)

3 - Trey Hopkins 

3 - Jonah Williams 

2 - Michael Jordan

2 - Xavier Sua-Filo

1 - Billy Price




Then there's a fellow named Eaton that posted this (overall):

Hopkins - 67.5

Jonah - 63.5

Jordan - 74.1

XSF - 75.5

BP - 51.7

IDK about grades but the line seemed to improve at least in pass blocking when he got on the field.
According to PFF hart graded better than Joe Burrow and Joe Mixon. Lmao. Probably due to the turnovers but still smh

Whoops I just doubled up on your post with a Dehner tweet lol. I'm a little worried about being down Geno & Mike while going against Chubb and Hunt
"given the bengals medical staff history, i'm a little concerned at this point about how many games geno will be able to play this season."
""
Having Geno and Mike out is rough. Hopefully Reader dominates the interior enough to keep Chubb & Hunt in check.
The only way we win this game is by subsiding their run game and winning the turnover battle in my opinion with the key one being stopping their run attack. They got dominated by the shit birds on Sunday. They're gonna come out and play bully-ball and try and be physical with our defense. Stop the run and put the game up to Baker and we have a good chance tomorrow night.
Thats......not ideal.
"I'm afraid that we're going to play really well, but they're going to destroy us running it up the middle"
"Your best bet to beat us is to score early.  Our coach, hell - the 4 coaches we‚Äôve had in the last 3 years - all panic and get away from the run super early if we‚Äôre behind.  Our receivers are tempting on paper, but our timing/line play has been historically ‚Äúnot good‚Äù or even average.  Baker‚Äôs life rests on a new tackle on the right and a rookie tackle on the left.  Our LB situation is abysmal and we have injuries in the secondary.  If you can buy your rookie qb time, he should be to make your TE look like a pro   bowler.  Last year TE‚Äôs ate us.  This offseason we lost our MLB (coverage guy) and an OLB  is hurt right now.  This game has the potential to be ugly, and could go either way.  It might come down to coaching and, god I hope not, kickers."
I think we're honestly going to blow the Browns out of the water. I'm happy that they all get an extra 10 days to rehabilitate.
Geno is going to be AJ last year isn't he?

"Whole offense was pretty bad for most of that game.

Burrow missed an easy TD to Green, Ross alligator arm'd a TD, offensive line was abysmal, Joe Mixon fumbled for the first time ever, Burrow got shaken by the pressure early(obviously overcame it for an amazing final drive) and left quite a few open receivers down the field with no ball.

Plenty to be optimistic about, but also a lot to improve."
I am pretty sure he could kick that field goal too.
The visual effects in these movies are incredible
Burrow definitely looks great in a Bengals uniform.
I really like the rookies first game. I mean he got no preseason and zero time with a vet. Burrow will be a stud if he makes it out of his rookie season.
I hope some meetings occurred and some feelings were hurt and an understanding was realized by the members of the offensive line that the changes for these team start with them.  Accountability.
"As a colts fan, dont do it. Don't end up like Andrew Luck."

"In my honest opinion, we didn't really see what this offense could do because we were likely playing against a top 10 defense and some say a top 5. With our defense, we are much better just from that one game. However, we will have to wait and see until we play a better offense to really get the final verdict. We also have to keep in mind we are still missing defensive players.

Edit: Also did our new linebacker play Sunday? Don't even know his name."
"I don't have one yet. We came out of the gate really strong against the Seahawks last year and then sucked ass the rest of the season. I don't think it'll be the same situation this season, but the Browns game will be more telling for me. Our Offensive line is still horrible dispite the talk of improvement. I really hope Fred and Hakeem get some playing time if this unit struggles like that again."
"I don‚Äôt think we learned a lot honestly. Seahawks game last year showed the danger of week 1 conclusions, let alone in this no preseason year. But certainly seemed like decent probabilities that:

-Oline sucks, maybe they can scheme out of it to get to below average like second half, but scary bad at times

-Joe should be good/clearly has grit

-AJ when healthy, as always, is a beast

-defense could be a very pleasant surprise. Again week 1 against tyrod not ready to get too pumped 

Should learn a lot this week"
"Very hopeful. Saw a lot of good and potentially very good, with reps, tightening up across the board, and less rust/rookie errors."
[deleted]
"I think we looked better on both sides of the ball than we did last year.  I think we improved throughout the game, and our offense once it gets in rhythm can be high powered.  I think we need to get healthy on D to be able to stop some of the better offenses."
"**The good:**

* Burrow looked very good for a rookie making a week 1 start. The shovel pass INT was the lone bad play. I don't think we see that too much in the future. He was as advertised

* The secondary. Bates is going to be All Pro material at some point if he stays healthy, and WJ3 looked more like 2018 WJ3 than 2019 WJ3

**The bad:**

* The O-Line. Oof. Thank God Burrow has some mobility and it wasn't Dalton back there - it could have been a homicide crime scene if not for his ability to move and ditch the pocket.

* The run defense. I've seen some folks say the run defense was good...it wasn't. They gave up 155 yards on the ground - 114 yards coming before the Reader injury. Not a good day, and it looks like a problem that has recurred over the past 3 seasons

* Play calling. Only 1 catch for Mixon is something that needs to change. He has to be a more crucial part of the passing attack. Overall, the play calling was a bit predictable and super vanilla. Perhaps that's because of no preseason. But Taylor's offensive play calling has been a bit of an area of concern for the last year.

**The ugly:**

* Fat Randy. He just isn't a good kicker. It's a moot point now, but cutting a drafted kicker in Elliot has singlehandedly cost this franchise no less than 5 wins over the past few years. I know kicking talent is scarce in this league, but at this point I'd almost rather take the gamble on anyone else during the period where we aren't really competing, so that we have someone developed by time the window opens

* Bobby Hart. Fuck Bobby Hart. That is all."
"Felt good last year after week 1.

I‚Äôm treading lightly, but I know this teams problems ain‚Äôt the QB this time."
"Lots of cautious optimism. Burrow looked calm and collected on that final drive, i think he'll be just fine going forward. All the main guys stayed healthy (green, mixon, burrow, etc). Bonby Hart was as bad as expected. Defense was alright but didn't seem as shit as last year."
Should have drafted O line early and often.
"Burrow has some really good moments but that INT trying to force the ball to Mixon annoys the hell out of me. He‚Äôs a rookie and should be given more help, instead he feels forced to do more himself and made the error trying to do too much."
We look like a 5-6 win team. The D looked pretty damn good against what will likely be one of the worst offenses in the league but the tackling looked better.
They need a RT - badly!
"Offense could never get a consistent tempo, lots of blames on that front. Defense again was a pleasant surprise even with the injuries in the preseason. I know we have more out for Thursdays game, but I look forward to seeing the pieces finally gel together, and when they're all there.


Also doesn't get said enough, but huge shout out to our special teams for always being consistent."

"If they decided to run the ball, we likely lose. If they put the ball in Baker's hands, we have a good chance."
21-17 Bengals. Burrow overcomes two turnovers throws a couple TDs. Mixon gets the other TD.
"My prediction is the Browns end the game on a very unhappy note.  They might win but they will lose more than just a game.  It will be the beginning of the end for Baker Mayfield and OBJ in Cleveland. They were embarrassed last week and this week they will be broken.

That or they run all over us."
"I hate to say it but I see Cleveland winning. They got embarrassed Sunday and have something to prove. Expect to see Garret being allowed into the backfield by Hart all night, and with our depleted D Line we aren't going to be able to hold Chubb back as the game progresses and Reader gets tired."
Trial by combat
24-20 Bengals
"With the injuries on both sides, it's really hard for me to tell. Browns also have like 3 olineman that are questionable (although they seem positive about all of them playing). But we are missing Geno Atkins and Mike Daniels and the browns have two really good RBs. I just don't know man."
"I hope Joe can throw a couple. That would be nice to see. 
I hope we see some more consistency in giving him some more time and more frequently
I hope we see another week of decent defense
I hope we see a better kicking performance"
27-21 bengals
24-17 Bengals
Fat Randy gets his redemption with a game winning field goal 24-21.
31-13

What a douche.
He calls Joe a ‚Äúkid‚Äù but looks like a 12 year old struggling through puberty. Also the idea that would ever even listen to this clown to have the opportunity to be ‚Äúupset with him‚Äù is hilarious.

"I love how this video really focuses its hatred on the special kind of terrible, unethical, and smelly type of person who sees a Steelers Jersey and thinks of anything other than dirty helmet-to-helmet contact.  Leading with the crown of their helmet every time.

If those bastards aren't up to referee-pleasing new-rule-creating bastard-style player-maiming cheap shot bullshit, they are probably eating babies.

This video really sums that up, thanks OP.

Fuck those dirty Steeler bastards."

"Honestly smart move on his part. If he was my grandfather, I wouldn‚Äôt want him traveling at his age."
I'm sure he's a little bummed about having to miss a primetime divisional game. Almost feel a little sorry for the guy. Almost.
"The torch is being passed. From a unlucky, albeit, shitty owner, to a new generation, in the endless pursuit of perfection. Who Fucking Dey ."
We havent won a playoff game since before his last absence.
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs upset he‚Äôs missing the game but low key not going to miss all the travel. That has to be exhausting for an 85 year old man.
A wise decision.
"In all seriousness, stay safe Mike.

Corona is a lethal fucker at his age."

"Or sleep a bit more before work. Dream of the promised land. We will be arriving soon and it starts with smashing the brownies.

 FTS WHO DEY."
How are we feeling about Boyd today boys? Gonna get a little more attention?
"Hart better get that ass in gear today, ain‚Äôt got no time for that funny shit"
Decided as a UK fan to torture myself tonight and watch the game (1:20am kick off!). Work tomorrow @ 9am will be killer but I am too hyped to wait until tomorrow to watch it!
Lettttssss go!!!
WHOOOOOODEEEEEEYYYYY!!!!
I get that we're not gonna be invincible world-beaters this year but I also SUPER don't understand fivethirtyeight giving the Browns a 68% chance to win this game. I know for baseball their sample size is all screwed up but for football... we lost a squeaker and the Browns got curbstomped by the Ravens. Fight me Nate Silver.
Newdey whoday
Need a minimum or 3 Burrow touchdowns tonight. Inject this shit into my veins. WHO DEY!
 Will they game be shown in Dayton?
"I am really looking forward to seeing If Big Joe can get over the prime time curse the Bengals have been in for the last,  Oh I dont know 40 years."
"I only expect to win TOPS 6 games this year, but boy will I be upset if this isnt one of them.   


\#WhoDey"
Start the match before I piss myself
Who else hopes Higgins gets some action? I‚Äôm excited to see what he can do.
Does local cable pick up NFL network games?
"I'm going in with tempered expectations. I want to see the units progress. We saw some flashes of good inside run defense last week. We're short some DTs so we'll really see our LBs put to the test. 

Our corners were sort of bland last week. We know Baker will occasionally overthrow his target. I'd like to see the corners or safeties hold on to an errant ball for an actual interception.

If the kicking is better than Randy the team will still bring back Bullock but the fans will certainly take notice. 

Offensively the rest of the team needs to get on Joe's level. 'nuff said.

**Edit**: I forgot the most important unit, the coaches. Will the coaches be on the sidelines holding players accountable for each play they miss on? Will they come up wrinkles to make the game more difficult for the Browns and more fun for our guys? Can we outcoach the other team? Can we win a **close** game???"
"#YEAH GAMEDAY!!

*checks calendar*

#AND I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT, FUCK ME"
Is there a way to watch it without cable?
"LET‚ÄôS GEAAAAAUUUUXXXX

JEAUX TIME, BOYS AND GIRLS!"
i have this weird feeling john ross is going for 100 yards tonight lol
I'm so aggravated with the media talking about the browns this the browns that and never mention Cincinnati. Not only that everyone keeps saying Cincinnati doesn't have any good players. I pray to god that Cincinnati shits all over Cleveland until there's a big enough mess that they can't clean up.
Uzomah goes off tonite
WHO DEY BABY!!!!
Very annoying that I can't watch this on cable since AT&T UVerse somehow does not carry NFL Network.
I am worried about tonights game.  How many Primetime games have we lost?  How many gimmie games have we lost.  And the Browns are going to have fans in the stands.  I think we will win but to be honest I would not be shocked if we did not.
Who the duck is kicking today?!?
Fuck the Steelers!
Can someone please PLEASE DM me a link?

Our interior D Line. Cleveland ran all over Baltimore and without Daniels and Atkins will probably do the same to us. We have to get out to an early lead and make Baker beat us with his arm.
"1) Bobby Hart does not start at RT.   

2) Bobby Hart does not play a snap."
Early scores. We gotta find a way to get ahead and make them abandon the run
"In no particular order: 

- We need Reader to eat blocks so Bynes or Pratt can come up to cut off the inside run. We really need both Dunlap and Hubbard to fully set the edge, because that was the only noticeable area we had issues stopping the run last week. 

- Put Sample/Uzomah in next to Hart or have Gio in for a higher % of snaps to help delay Garrett and Ogunjobi. The right side of our line is going to get fucked regardless. 

- Involve Joe (Mixon) frequently and early to set up the deep ball. Cleveland's secondary and linebackers are boiled dog turds but forcing them to cheat up will open up some good 1 on 1 opportunities with AJ and Boyd."

Too many videos to link but GMFB has tons of Burrow/Bengal videos this morning. Nate already called Burrow the best young quarterback he has ever seen. The hype is real over there.

*Might?*
Why in the world would hart talk trash... come on
It‚Äôs almost like Bobby Hart has a history of saying and doing stupid things.
It BAFFLES me that despite everything we‚Äôve seen. That the coaches still show some sort of faith in Hart. Trash does not do him justice
"As far as leaving him one on one, we'll have to see how much they run the five wides set again this week. I know they like the mismatches it creates on defense, but it also creates an automatic mismatch for whoever end up across from Hart.

Burrow's TD came out of that formation, but so did 2/3 Chargers sacks."
"> It‚Äôs hard to put this all on Hart

> one of the best defenders in the NFL

I guess this Chris Roling guy is legally blind. Someone hook him up with a seeing-eye dog.

E: Seriously though. Bobby Hart and Jim Turner are the only things stopping me from thinking the team is about to be something truly special."
Shart must be blackmailing somebody in the front office or something bro. You telling me they can‚Äôt find someone cheaper to be just as bad as this fool.
"""Might""? The coaching staff is full on Ray Charles blind when it comes to him for some reason. Having Jim Turner is bad enough but having him also continue to put faith into the human embodiment of a wet fart is way worse."
Can we fire Jim Turner already. There's no reason why Bobby should've be 1 on 1 with Bosa. Need better planning and scheming on the Oline and Jim is a direct result of that. Hell the changes made midway last season came from Zach not Jim

Welcome to hell lol the stairway to heaven has been built and we are on our way boys!!! #WhoDEY
A critique for next time if I may. the orange looks a little yellow at least in the picture. I thought these were Steelers cookies at first glance. I recommend making the orange a little more red leaning.
Ahahaha tonight was a warm welcome to the reality that is the Bengals.

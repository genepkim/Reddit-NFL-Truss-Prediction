aka we lost to a statistically mediocre football team that is well coached
removed
we can kill romans playcalling and gameplan all we want but those first 2 drives the playcalling was creativity and perfect honestly
it isnt his drive to drive play calling that sucks it is the overall coaching pre snap penalties alignment issue wr communication issues snapping issues etc etc and the situational play calling our 4th down plays have been extremely questionable at times like direct snapping in the rain to a rb with a snapper who has issues or direct snapping it to lamar in an empty set in the titan games

like look at the patriots they had the highest 4th and 1 success rate of all time by just qb sneaking it with brady if you shotgun snap it on 4th and 1 you are probably over thinking it qb sneaks work really well so do power dives yet most of our 4th down conversions are shotgun snaps empty backfield with 0 deception he makes some seriously questionable decisions in key moments abandons the run when we are down in games and seems strait adverse to up tempo which has worked for us everytime we try it with lamar

roman isnt a bad scheme guy but he is like the pees of offence he shoots himself in the foot at key moments and costs you important games we probably were better off keeping him at run game coordinator and finding a young creative coach to work those schemes into a an offence that can use wrs better and scheme guys open
the thing with roman is thats two games in a row where weve seen some new wrinkles added in

now we gotta see that throughout the entire game not just a drive here and there or after a half it has to be consistent
last week he had horrible scripted plays and great adjustments this week he had great scripted plays and terrible adjustments
this is because those are the drives that are scripted they work it in practice thats how they want to attack the defense that week

roman falls apart when he gets punched in the mouth he panics and loses his identity and he simply cannot put together a passing offense he is cam cameron with a running game
do we have to qb sneak it with lamar cant we put someone else in at qb for that so what happened to mahomes doesnt happen to lamar

lol doesnt it suck that this asshole is the only one in the media not dumping on lamar

but ill take it i guess
also we didnt have 3 of our best run stoppers on our defense who wouldve figured ne would run the ball so well
wait hes defending him
i thought lamar did fine
with a full roster that game would have been a lock
we need to tighten up on those penalties so when lamar works his magic its not immediately reversed
i think colin gets a bad wrap around here i usually find his takes interesting and well thought out he paints with very broad strokes a lot so tgst could be a critique but to me thats what makes him interesting he can box things in to be able to point things out
bbbbbased
i feel like the talking heads have transitioned to being on lamars side which im all for even though i dont take sports shoes seriously its still nice not to have to hear that trash our boy
am i the only one that loves this show sure his takes are dumb and corny at times but the show is good
this sub hates cowherd but ive always loved him since his sports nation days with michelle beadle he may be classic hot take guy for the clicks and all that but theres no denying hes pretty hilarious and knows sports pretty damn well
lamars getting hate for that game i havent seen it i think he actually played a pretty excellent game the rest of the team let him down
i like colin his analogies on stuff are usually really good and interesting plus joy being there is great they work together very well
lol its funny that people suddenly think cowherd has solid takes when he happens to support their qb

my one thrift store find in ct was a ray lewis miami jersey


its copypasta
you do realize that 97 of comments on twitter are either trolls or assholes stay off there if you want to hold on to your sanity
they dont leave we thought they would last january they didnt
its trolling ya got got
i had a party this afternoon and now were embarrassed in front of company

i know its trolls but the thought of someone hosting a watch party and being this mortified when their team loses and ruins the party is really cracking me up
fucking 63 team is an embarrassment lmao skura and hollywood are the only 2 that should be feeling some way today
ive stuck with the os all these years why would i bail on a football team thats had only 4 losing seasons in 20 years i get being frustrated at losing what was arguably a winnable game but get some perspective
been around since 02 and 03 were not a championship team this year but ill still ride
the only part of the game that made me feel like crying was when boyle got hurt and thats only because hes a great guy and a great player and i hate to see him or any player get hurt

torched he got a td on a trick play
i dont think anyone is saying the weather machine thing and being remotely serious also why are you so angry
rpatriots come get your mans

dudes a troll lets just get this removed
bitch move from a pats fan but idk why people always downvote me when i say this dudes a liability on the field
i dont know how exactly effective it is because i literally only see the steelers do it so frequently but theyve done it a lot and it seems to get them yardage enough

plus itd be a great way to incorporate players like brown and duvernay with their speed just dump it off to them and let them zoom out of there

thoughts
theres a lot of route concepts we can use that would maximize our receivers potentials and help out oline we just dont because they werent incorporated into our offense by the oc

bubble screens rb screens quick crossers right behind the line naked bootlegs to the weak side actually getting the ball to a receiver on an end around we can be doing a ton to get receivers in space the problem is our route trees are bad they are basic and they are easily defended

teams with good receivers and good passing offenses dont just rely on their receivers beating coverages they scheme them open with rubs and crossing routes and attacking multiple levels of the defense creating mismatches or missed assignments

we dont really do any of that regularly and our fan base seems to think its normal but you take any top receiver in the league right now and plug them in the equivalent spot on our offense and they struggle just as badly
we try those sometimes with brown my issue with brown on those or any time he catches the ball actually is hes always looking to juke or something dumb he never just turns it on and breaks up field
we dont really get anyone open and no one aside from snead and andrews occasionally can seem to catch when contested they just have better receivers and scheme them better
lamar will never do something like that his instinct is to extend the play and extend it some more until hes dropped for a loss or gets a 15 yard gain

this made me laugh until i saw gase and hue definitely hurt your argument but i do agree to a point i think harbaugh is a great motivator and leader or men but needs a good oc and dc
harbaugh will always be as good as his coordinators i have always said that dont get me wrong he is a sb winning head coach he can get a team onto that track and there are a lot of great coaching minds that cant but he has to have strong coordinators and right now he just doesnt he has uneven coordinators capable of putting the best od on the field or capable of looking like highschool coaches
this might be lowkey facts
not even funny tbh high key facts
i have always wanted harbaugh to try calling plays tbh if he sucks at it whatever but if he is at all good at it it would solve a problem that plagued us forever like what do we have to lose he has been around football forever give it a shot
lol classic harbaugh

always reminds me of this
and for any young people on this sub this is in reference to when lebron held a whole press conference to announce he was taking his talents to south beach to join the heatinstead of returning to the cavs back in 2010
dont
lamar when its 2023 and willie snead is still the no 1 wr on the ravens

its painfully obvious we cant develop wrs but i just cant understand why is it our wr coach or other coaches is it our scheme what is it
been a thing for some time now i think part of it falls on the loyalty shown by the ravens organization to underperforming staff you have to really suck for a long time to be shown the door so when we get a dud we usually get stuck with him for a long time

there could be something in the cultureatmosphere that is not conducive to developing wrs i dont know what that would be but its very common for organizations to have very distinct cultures ive worked places that are amazing at bringing junior staff on board and ive worked places that are truly terrible at it failures here are often boil down to senior staff and mid level managers not being effective leaders senior management often overlooks this and assumes that underperforming staff all have something wrong with them
tale as old as time man

best wr drafted in team history was torrey smith who was a good wr but its sad hes our best given our successful drafts across the board

our wr and te coach who is our old wr coach suck so much ass
i think its because we prioritize elite speed andor height dont ever get a prospect that has the potential to be a do it all guy i like duvernay and im not gonna give up on brown yet
i put it mostly on coaching if roman leavesgets fired i hope the new oc is an external candidate who brings a wr coach with them
david culley is the passing game coordinator and wr coach that should tell you a lot also were just not great at drafting wrs
my turn to ask this question tomm
this was an issue in the billick era as well and i feel like harbaugh has proven himself to be able to get the most out of what hes given which makes me think that this is an issue of drafting but thats a helluva long time to not be able to get it right even once
i dont think wrs last long in baltimore i think the guy that stayed the longest in baltimore was derrick mason20052010
i mean look at perriman maybe hes an outlier but we could be suppressing development through our scheme to me it looks like a cyclical problem what i mean by that is we havent had too many 1 wrs so weve learned to play like we dont have one and since we play like we dont have one our wrs never get chances to show their ability i also think it has a lot to do with runfirst ocs
dobbins is great but we couldve just drafted mims instead of drafting a rb we refuse to use
watching jefferson on the vikings and it looks like we missed another
i think the bigger question is why we still try

k and then who plays center justice hill
im not trying to defend him too much he played poorly but his snaps started going awry the week he had his finger split open and then this game was a monsoon

even if those two excuses didnt exist you cant cut ties w a guy over a couple bad games especially when theres no one else to go get

lamar turned the ball over 4 times against pit and single handedly cost us the gamedo you want to cut him too no you dont grow up its a long season

who cares
dont get me wrong ima watch my ravens cause truss but im not optimistic primarily the injuries has wrecked us for games to come but we just dont look in sync like we did last year

although i know we had alot players out and it was the raining almost as if god was against us we just werent it its confirmed the following for me

our offense schemes are trash and predictableunorthodox plz get rid of roman were undisaplined our offense line is trash our marygoround system of rbs is hurting us ingram has lost a step our receivers are unreliable and were not a comeback team

despite all that im impressed we were only 1 score from winning probs due purely due to flashes of superior athletism were just not in good shape to compete with front runner teams this year also we lost to a team the jets stomped on im embarrassed its gonna be a long rest of the season
i am getting seriously worried about the amount of scary injuries we have at key players going into next year acl tears and other serious tissue injuries are no joke
yeah the loss sort of killed any hope i had for a great year and am just trying to be pleasantly surprised if things go well
agreed not only the injuries but i saw this as a game that we should easily win and potentially win by a lot the pats are not as good as before so they cant score 20 puts a half like with brady
the penalties were less than in previous games but seemed to be at really inopportune times
the wild snap in the 4 th quarter that led to the 17 yd loss really came at a bad time lamar seems to be able to handle the wet and wild snaps up to that point the ravens were down by 5 then and seemed to be advancing well with just the right amount of time left to score and eat up clock time


goal smashed within a couple hours it jumped at least 3k today it was at about 4700 by the time it was posted in here 5700 when i 1st saw it nearing 7700 now

i know this sub was a big part of it with several members broadcasting the link focus on the good

edit the charity donations broke 9k today way to go flock
i expected support from ravensflock

i never wouldve predicted this

in the span of 2 hours

skuras pbtf pledgeit page had 135 donors contribute 2500

the goal was met

ravens fans really stepped up

someone tell mattskura62

he might want to raise that bar

josh allen gets diggs
baker gets odell and landry
murray gets hopkins
mahomes comes in with weapons just to get even more

lamar gets a 58 midget
yes he needs help but dont slander hollywood like that hes talented just not what we need
chill with the midget reference

despite him being on the shorter side for a wr he still made the nfl thats very impressive

yes he shouldnt be the 1 wr but thats not his fault

lastly sometimes a coaches job is to scheme around the talent sometimes a qb has to make his wr better

theres flaws to this team and lamar has some of them lets roll with what we got and see what the team can do
maybe roman should stop scheming up goddamn 5050 balls for him
lamar has help mark andrew hollywood ingram dobbins etc arent mysteriously bad we have good offensive weapons we just arent using them properly and part of it is on the offense part of it is on lamar and part of it is on the coaching staff everyone has to look into the mirror and make some changes
everyone trashed me and a few others for saying get ab and was cool with our receiving core coming into the season

i mean i dont want to say i told you guys so but i told you guys so
we should try marquise brown in the slot he may not be physical enough to play the outside he can get into space better that way too we need to do anything we can to get him in space better hell lets put him at punt return he returned punts in college i only had this thought because i like the way the bears utilize anthony miller despite their treacherous offense
he has the physical characteristics of a slot receiver i dont think they have the depth at the wr position to replace snead with him it would be smart to start playing proche duvernay or dez at wr more it sucks because the two best receivers are both slot receivers
who plays outside than snead lol duvernay lol
is he tough enough to play there and willing to take a hit i dont think so
really wished we kept this dude hes really fulfilled his potential and added a nice skillset to match his size and strength wouldve been a huge help in ne but glad to see he is doing well elsewhere i guess
zach sieler also just got a fat extension for the dolphins i was super high on him but we let him go for the win now mode

look at it this way obj playing so good he got 2 positions locked down
orlando out here starting at both tackles
fluker got taken out late in that game as well
that oline is sus
lamar is literally carrying kicking screaming trash cans and mops to a playoff spot
whats up with fluker was he hurt
mekari was our rt

we honestly dont really know how proche and duve will pan out i can guarantee you if the steelers picked up either one of those 2 they would be balling like claypool is rn are we the only franchise that cannot draft and develop receivers are we cursed or something when it comes to receivers even the worst teams in the nfl can develop receivers better than us
we just wanna see duvernay get more chances
for starters duvernay is pretty good
steve smith desean jackson ty hilton
youre right julio jones would be a good addition to this ravens team
well we seemed to have made it work from 20062009 when our top two receivers were both 510 mason and clayton

belee dat lots of negativity going around but this man is gonna get us a ring
just saw the injury for the first time and it looked nasty never saw the injury report but hope it wasnt as serious as it looked
also the hate against lamar jackson and that lost when he played in a monsoon last night is stupid even tho im not big on the guy no qb plays well im those conditions media is just looking for a storyline
anyway see yall turkey day

edit grammar
appreciate you that weak side just became a hell of a path for tj to disrupt the play
to tell you how serious it was harbaugh announced boyle out for the year at the post game press conference
gtfoh
makes no sense to me
a team we beat just blew out the titans contrary to popular belief this ravens team is still a solid team maybe not sb favorites but we are still capable of winning most games

might be tougher with the injuries now but this titans team has shown weaknesses too
home team vegas still likes our chances of blowing out teams for some reason titans really havent looked good either
good question maybe because taylor lewan isnt playing
idk maybe tennessee defense isnt good
thats shocking
titans have looked terrible lately
bengals and colts beat the titans and their bears game was an uninspiring win we ravens fans are focusing on the negatives but we still have a good defensive coordinator and just because 2 players are out doesnt mean were going to get torched and our offense still has potential to pop off if they can just figure it out
because odds aret about a teams likelihood to win but how much the house has to pay out if they win

jesus christ this gets explained so much on here and rnfl

coach evans joins me to discuss the ravens defense vs patriots including

reasons why the run defense continued to fail
how coach teaches a lineman to hold their ground vs a double team
why both teams should have game planned to stop the run spoiler there was not a 1 receiver in the area code

it was nice but now were back to our regular scheduled programming lol luckily im used to it haha
it was an outlier this season is more what were used to seeing historically from ravens football
stop the count
its embarrassing that our mvp qb has to play right to the end of the games this year smh


well good news for you cleveland is also 63 with a game left against them with a chance to also win the division so there are 2 horses in this race for ya
most of us have already accepted the reality that is the wild card
as a steelers fan balitimore has to beat the titans and the steelers back to back two extremely psychical games it will have an affect on their play but if they pull it off it would be incredibly impressive

the steelers have 3 tough games ahead of us worst case scenario we go 12 4 or 13 3

best case is 15 1

the packers are great and all but id be more worried about the saints or bucs than us

hes qb1 at this point
america has decided

elite sleepy joe is replacing the darnold
hes so elite
pretty flacco time
if he gets around 200 yards this week hell pass kerry collins for 19th all time in passing yards go joe
told yall hed be starting
elite dragonnnnnnn
he did good
dude almost won last week he puts points on the board but their defense sucks
i dint have to guess my phone says its 1657
for as much as lamar gets the injury concerns label tagged on him can we label darnold as injury prone now

ugh this is actually bad for our tank haha
doesnt really matter during this time all teams are tough for us right now hopefully this will pass

fuck the steelers
i am enjoying the packers season because i do a little betting but i would rather die than compliment them in their team sub wtf
i am a steelers fan

even though we have respect for you its hard to enjoy any of your games and id assume vice versa
i understand why a neutral fan would enjoy seeing steelers football but holy shit not a ravens fan


booooooooo

thats worse than the love letter someone wrote about suggs signing with kc last season after he got claimed weirdos on this sub
fucking cuck
lol this is exactly the kind of shit ive come to expect from reddit nfl fans bet this due tolerates no trash talk and has one beer for each game no more no less
came here to say that seeing the name jay gibbons made my day
im a raiders fan that always disliked the steelers so naturally ive always dig the ravens to beat them this is mad funny that he got exposed wonder if this post will even get a reponse from him cuz man even the replies from some steeler fans clownin the ravens in that post and him replying with shit like wtf bro dont ban him until he responds lmaooo

what a loser anyone who has grown up baltimore fan is born with a burning hate for all things pittsburgh fuck the steelers big truss
the steelers are having a good season and that pisses me the fuck off

we should be focusing on fixing ourselves and hoping we improve not heaping praise on a fanbase with already overinflated heads and an ego they dont deserve

yinzers will scream superbowl on the way after a 10 win season they dont need your support they need a boot up their ass and some realism glasses

gross
its fake hes a steeler fan lmao just ban him please
i hate when ppl go to other teams reddits after an l or a w its just cringe karma farming
a steelers fan posing as a ravens fan pretending to be jealous of the steelers is the most pathetic thing ive seen get on that bandwagon before its too late we dont want you

my face right now
that is the most limp wrist post ive ever seen on reddit

everybody boo this man booooooo
god i agree bandwagon fans are dumb as fuck
im not one for humiliating someone so maybe we should just stone him
alot of these ravens fans arent really fans they are bandwagon fans who jumped on because of lamar they werent around for the rough times with players upon players on injury reserve and the struggles so as soon as the ravens hit a bad patch they look to jump onto the next bandwagon
these new ravens fans are deluded as to who our rivals are they hate tom brady and the pats more than they hate the steelers

fuck the steelers
fuck the steelers
get this man up outta here
for shame
what a weirdo

uhhhhh so this one of those situations where we burn him at the stake right
weird being a fan of a team who can win the division and rooting all the way for the team were trying to top in division thats some niche fandom hahaha
i always like to watch the steelers i route against them but like to watch them
fuck the steelers the only time i enjoy watching them is when they lose ban this mofo
this person is a fan of winning teams he probably also likes the bucs and nfc west became a ravens fan when lamar took us for a ride last year nothing to see here
bros probably only been a ravens fan for about a year lets get rid of him pls
i hate them and they suck to watch
dude this isnt from a ravens fan not a real one anyway dont sweat it
like i have respect for them and mike tomlin is obviously one of the best in the league but fuck the steelers
guys its time to pull out the pitchforks
who the fuck says shit like this also ujaygibbons69 your username made me legitimately lol nice
ban him from posting grow some balls mods
hes the type of guy who would apologize for hurting someones fist after they punch him in the face
karma bitch
the comments in that thread about him being a cuck are too good
hes extremely silent what a terd has he responded to any of the many people who tagged him his phone has been getting blown up so theres no way he doesnt know
my favorite player of all time is jerome bettis


i think hes the only fucking person to ever say that
jay gibbons getting popped for peds was the day my faith in childhood heroes died
i am one of those annoying louisville bandwagon fanssorry i am from bfe so didnt have an nfl team growing up however i did know a few steelers fans and they all sucked i may be a bandwagon ravens fan but by god i have hated the steelers for life i mean who the hell does this guy or girl think they are
this gives me erectile dysfunction
this dude is a straight up beta
yuck
uarcadiandelsol can eat a fat dicki hope he chokes on it too
lol im a dodgers fan so this doesnt even bother me weve had so many bandwagoners come in go within the last 10 years
the only reason id want the steelers to go to the superbowl is so that they face danny dimes and he fulfills the prophecy of 3li on them instead of the pats hell let them make it undefeated like the pats did itll only sting more when they lose and that will be good enough for me until our team gets it together next year
wot in steeler simping tarnations admins permaban this fool his friends and his family this is the way
ban him
ban them
shame on this person i say shame
hate the steelers but lowkey rooting for the browns to be relevant again given the history between us and them

that way beating them is that much sweeter
not shocked
this note is way gayer than mere gay sex
ravens fan
disgraceful
as a j je jaee

just stunt on these hoes
can we ban this guy from our sub
who cares yall some of the fussiest babies ive ever met sometimes

proving my point guys you literally went into the steelers sub screenshotted a post thats just a guy saying he enjoy watching the steelers posted it back here to try and ostracize him and are downvoting anyone who doesnt care
bro this is pure sarcasm but kys
im a texans fan just visiting but i get his point like good football comes first no the cleveland houston game does not count as good football 710 final is an ugly ugly game
greg roman is embarrassing

lamar is overrated need to get bradshaw traded to the flock immediately mvbradshaw

maybe unpopular opinion i like cris collinsworth because hes not afraid to call out officials or coaches for being stupid
fuck the refs
the refs not being great doesnt mean the pats werent the better team that night we had plenty of opportunities to win and we didnt
if you leave a game up to the refs you didnt play well enough to win it on your own

were starting to look like trump supporters just accept that we lost and move on

edit found the trump supporters
im not familiar with how much blocking hurst did when he was in here but id imagine they could fill the hurst role
certainly we will have dez gain 40 pounds by sunday and then learn an entirely new skill set no prob
i dont think either are big enough or good enough blockers to be a more effective te than someone we get on fa
dez hasnt caught a pass in 3 years at wr let alone at te
no
not sure about that but i feel like they got no choice but to throw dez out there soon
no chance they dont have the weight to throw around in there while blocking even mark andrews has like 35 pounds on dez
if i had to guess they probably sign wilson to a contract at some point this week and have a few more tryouts for some vets or they bring back one of the tes they cut from preseason
transition ricard maybe
ok i can sorta see doing it with boykins but why in the actual fuck would we try with dez hes 31 hasnt played in 3 years and hes on a 1 year deal we also have several decent prospects on the practice squad hell we dont even know if he can play at all

with boykins maybe hes have to put on a ton of mass id say at least 30 pounds of muscle which would put him roughly at kittles size he miiight be able to do that in the offseason but i still think it would take a full year or two to make that transition

i do think he would make a great te im just wondering if its worth the investment andrews is still around we draft tes probably better than anyone and we still have breeland who was projected pretty high until his injury
no
no xavier grimble will be the te2 next week

they may split the roles though with grimble doing more of the blocking and dezboykin running similar routes to boyle which was largely outlet passes for lamar
we gotta remember that this team never has won without going through adversity no weapon formed against us shall prosper well comeback stronger we just have to trust harbs
never forget that we went 106 the last time we won the super bowl
besides we survived worse shit
and lamar had like a 76 percent completion rate and a 99 qb rating in a monsoon i think were ok but the last half will be a true test
i think our defense will be get back to form if it gets healthy
saw someone comment this on a post but even both superbowl runs we faced adversity


2000 clear qb controversy pretty sure each qb played like 8 games each


2012 fired our oc cam cameron halfway through the season


while i will agree the loss was very disappointing but as much as we would like to think so were not a perfect team and we just have to go week by week not gonna win the superbowl halfway through the season
im really not too bummed about last game besides the injuries
mostly i am sad that is bringing out the worst in people on this forum more toxic than ive ever seen it before
exactly
the injuries are piling up though if calais and williams and jimmy can get healthy i think our d will return to form but unless the coaches change up the offensive scheme i think the injuries on the o line are insurmountable to win a super bowl with also in years past the ravens have had tremendous veteran leadership to rally around mainly in ray lewis but also in marshall yanda ed reed and to some degree a steadying presence in flacco this season i havent seen the type of steady disciplined leadership and focused energy to give me hope that the ravens can still be a superbowl contender this season i see more chaos than steady focus dont get me wrong im still hopeful but im just not expecting anything crazy like i was last season
i appreciate the optimism but weve stalled as an offense against playoff bound opponents we cant win from behind and we look downright abysmal when we give up the run game when were trailing in a game it seems like gro forgets were run specialists by trade and can still use it to set up a big pass see here

i used to get so frustrated when we had flacco and wed constantly run play action check downs to ray rice teams could snuff it out because defenses didnt have to worry about flacco taking off and going 80 yards to the house now we have one of the most dynamic qbs in the league and we abandon the play action when were down by a score or two its baffling why wed kneecap ourselves like that

granted were dealing with major injuries on both sides of the ball this seasonnot to mention the retirement of a hof offensive lineman still harbs has got to hold the offense accountable for boneheaded illegal formation penalties and play calling

we have a tough row to hoe until we get past tennessee and pittsburgh and even then its no cake walk for now were reduced to duking it out with the browns for a wild card spot

tldr let lamar loose
hey i know the truth sorry youre so angry see you in a couple weeks ive already issued my apology to the thread owner

edit again i would gladly admit coming here to troll just to upset you in particular but its not the case
removed

im a ravens fan but my wifes boyfriend is a steelers fan so i have no choice to root for the steelers while im in the basement and hes railing her out

edit context
the dude even said i want the ravens to win but if they lose im okay with it seeing the steelers lose would hurt more you are on a historic run

there have been plenty of 90 teams its not historic and saying seeing your rival lose would hurt more than your team shows that your team isnt really your team
fuck the steelers
honestly even beyond sports though ben roethlisberger is a violent rapist
that dude has to be trolling both subs right seeing if he can enter meme status
yeah fuck em
fuck them all
and the new york jets i feel cheated lied to and all around crushed might never recover but seriously ai thought it was pretty interesting
sorry to disappoint you more but theyre headquartered in buffalo
welcome to the world of corporate sponsors my friend
it could be worse at least its not pnc pittsburgh
wait until you find out how many teams claim bud light as their official light beer
mt came to maryland after they bought first national of maryland i think thats why they bought the naming rights mt was founded in buffalo in the mid1800s though so theyre home base is buffalo
do you guys actually use mt i picked it on a whim and got these cool ass ravens and md flag cards my old bank aint have shit like that
m and t bank stadium helped sponsor their playoff birth in 2017
actually mt isnt the sponsor of the jets anymore just bills and ravens

good times
a much better time i remember this was supposed to be the game of the week and then we just steamrolled them
back when everybody was healthy and the offense was firing on all cylinders i miss yanda and stanley
this was shortly after i moved to houston went out to a bar to watch thinking it would be somewhat close things got real awkward really fast
man where gas the lamar gone who would pass like this run like this without regard for opposing defenders ankles the offense that ran players to spread the field like this that ran the double pistol

what have you done greg roman

i remember this day i watched the game and was excited we won
unfortunately even though this game was key in us having a shot at a bye at the end of the year it cant be counted as a big or important game because lamar played well
i really dont know what to think about this

edit he played 6466 and 43 of the snaps over the last 3 games
hes been getting more pressure than anyone else on the team just isnt showing up on stat sheet
ben gets rid of the ball at league high speed so pressure is tough to generate there and against the pats pass rush was largely negated by their ability to run at will so for 23 games i wouldnt put much stock into lack of pass rush stats
again ive said this before a stat sheet tells half the story hes been getting pressure which helps other players too

the pats game will skew stats for any player as we were so week on the line

the stats would likely be much better for him if we had a fully healthy line through those 3 weeks
hes also done the job that smith did for judon ngakoue is bringing the heat but also drawing the focus for judon and mcphee on the other side
hes in the pocket it feels like every other play so thats been a upgrade for sure his speed move is killer the next step is getting his hands on the qb every down
yeah hes popping on film im not worried about it
hes been applying an enormous amount of pressure so far despite only being here for 3 games considering how complex our defense is im not too worried about it so far
how many pass rush situations were there in the pats game not many
and ill say this in case anyone else reads this


the ravens have always known that ngakoue isnt a run stopper his goto move the chop into a jump and rip inside is the biggest piece of evidence of this he gives up contain to work his man and rush inside anybody who has watched any film on him knows this and i guarantee the coaching staff knows


would some sacks be nice yeah but ben has the quickest snap to throw time in the league indy has a pretty great oline and it was shitty field conditions last week give him some time
yannick ngakoue and this entire sub has combined for 3 tackles in 3 games and 0 sacks since yannick has been traded from minnesota

the ravens shield wouldve been perfect for this

my favorite series
its a shame we dont have earl thomas for this one

arcadian was the imposter
who in their right fucking mind tells the steelers rooting for you all the way

fuck the steelers and fuck that guy honestly
hahaha i commented saying this guy is an imposter because no ravens fan in his right mind would ever say that and he said hes had season tickets since the memorial stadium days so its treason then
that man is screwed i heard the punishment for this kinda treason is being lined up against the wall and have tucker use him as a target when practicing
lmao yall roasting this man
finally a decent meme nice
this guys been banned right this is unacceptable behavior
we should let him know were rooting for him all the way with a nice ban lmao
context
shame shame shame
normally i hate shitting on a user but since this guy was full on stockholm syndrome on the steelers nuts seems legit

also fuck the steelers
jaygibbons69 is an elite username
he would have gotten away with it too if
yinzer spy in the base
okay this is genuinely the funniest shit ive seen all day
on the one hand thats a quality gif on the other hand who cares about that guy
op i love your username
this guy just hopped over whiteboobs as the most hated guy in this subreddit
this is the distraction i need this week thanks fam
i mean you can do some shit and be like what the fuck but this
lets see what should i make my user name

how about an obscure 260 hitter from 19 years ago oh and add 69
this is how blue jays fans felt after seeing jay gibbons play for the orioles after being drafted by the blue jays
youre missing the playoffs anyways why complain about petty shit

i want to go back to that

1 why does it matter
2 were relevant
i mean i dont really care about these things we havent done the best job lately at earning respect even if we have injuries plenty of other teams have injuries we have to let our play do the talking people are gonna say what theyre gonna say
every post like this just shows the demographic of this fan base now these are daily posts

its always been this way always and just like years passed we ignore it and prove people wrong
bashing the ravens comparing murray to lamar is getting a lot of press right now there were a lot of expectations for this team

if i see one more article that says murray is who we thought lamar jackson was im going to go crazy

jackson won the mvp with willie snead as his 1 wr murray has hopkinslets not pretend that doesnt matter
ryan clark makes my ears bleed
i fucking hate espn
its always been like this other than maybe last season
definitely biased i watch them everyday and the narrative gets worse and worse
they can stay hating maybe roman will get some negative press
the media has been doing this to the ravens for years including our 2012 super bowl run last year was the outlier and we had to be literally one of the best football teams in the past 30 years to earn respect

dont watch talking sports heads they are clueless mostly and want attention eyeballs clicks they are not serious people mostly
lamar can be polarizing more people will tune in for a hot button issue
espn is literally a reaction channel
crushing that boyle went down hopefully he can make a full recovery football aside were pretty te reliant do we have any other tight ends coming up the depth chart or on our radar to sign
they worked out lukewilson
delanie walker available dont know why we wouldnt sign him
they signed willson to the psquad grimble has a little bit of experience likely they just roll with some combo of the 2
we have culkin and grimble on the practice squad it is far likely one or both of them make the active roster before any other outcome
i saw a rumor from zrebiec that we were in talks with ed dickson
jeremy shockey
maybe we go after a veteran like dallas clark
ravens have been linked to antonio gates lorenzo neal played with the chargers at the same time as gates and neal went on to play with the ravens

lets feed gus early and often and see how it plays out id love to commit to a single rb as the workhorse guy and get him 1520 carries
that titans lost gave me depression im not gonna liewe have to win for our playoff place this is revenge game
for sure titans got hit at the right time theres certainly an advantage to that

but we have continuous issues week after week its week 11 now and and im having doubts these get sorted even more so with the injuries piling up if it were just a slump i wouldnt be worried but its clear it isnt
agree but we still have to win enough games to get into the playoffs
we cant get the 7th seed because that means well face the chiefs and i do not have confidence facing them in the playoffs
historically we have kinda limped into the playoffs when we do win sounds cliche but those teams were dogs idk if this team has that same grit whos our tough guy now mcphee maybe peters on defense yanda last year on the offense but who this year this aint it chief unless they change their mentality soon it feels like another one and doner to me
cursed image

i want to beat tennessee so bad and i think back to the documentary about the 1970 baltimore colts super bowl team who lost to the jets in the 68 super bowl in the greatest upset in super bowl history and when they played them two years later the colts players talked about how we knew and they knew we were gonna kick their ass

i hope the ravens are bringing that same energy this week because the loss to the titans last year was the greatest upset in playoff history

you had an mvp quarterback a top 4 defense the most rushing yards in the history of football and you lose by 16 points at home we have to be out for blood this week
ive been saying this all year
unfortunately its possible to be shit in the regular season and in the playoffs
i agree its better to get some problems out of the way now than have it bother us in the playoffs clean up the illegal formation penalties stop over pursuing in the backfield going for big hits instead of getting the sack play calling etc
revenge isa comin and my god is it hungry
stunt on these hoes
we are not able to beat a 3 and 6 team what makes you think were going to play any better in the play offs
do you think greg roman is going to get hot later in the season dudes a clown we go 106 at best
lj is up to it
me too i am hoping for the reverse of last season
team needs a leader to rally the troops ray lewis was the perfect leader ed reed was that leader too

im looking at this team and i dont know whos leading the pack
with how banged up our defensive line is im expecting king henry to tear us a new one
no playoffs this year probably sorry guys
we have to make the playoffs first
would be cool if we could stop having season ending injuries

the narratives we build in our heads
i hate to be that guy but they way were playing we might not make the playoffs theres a lot of good afc teams this year and theyre all fighting for the last couple spots
text goes here testing
like bruh i need to know
henry already has 80 yards rushing so far and the game is 5 days away
williams is out next week i believe campbell is day to day
oh man i am not trying to see justin ellis again
cambel
theyre both going to be out if not harbs would have said it he hates to comment on any injury after those perriman scars
yeah theyre definitely out wink told me on a call this morning

i remember watching this game ravens browns on my phone while smoking a cigar with my dad in the garage fond memories
lmao i will never not clown them for this
the sweetest moment was the look of horror and sheer disappointment on i believe specifically bud duprees face whenever mosley intercepted the ball man that was glorious inject that straight into my veins
exactly screw them how dare they want to get to the playoffs
removed
dez at te lmaoo were fucking depleted
damn we need dez in our passing game is awful i know hes not proven to do anything in years but we may as well give him some snaps or its pointless even signing him
yes let us play these 4 people out of position for the rest of the season that is certainly preferable to simply signing an actual professional te
ricard already is at te
if we need dez and miles to perform were totally fucked
why would gus move to fallback how would that help
most teams already have one te they mostly use we were in the minority with the heavy amount of snaps we gave to two tes we will miss out on boyles run blocking but overall it shouldnt effect the offense other than mandrews getting more snaps which might honestly be a better thing for the pass game


stranger things has happened i think we have a shot but may need to score a shit load of points henry will average close to 10 yards a carry
good news is the titans defense is playing at a much lower level than last season but we still have to worry about their run and play action offense should be a tough game that can go either way
they played like shit against the colts so that gives me confidence if they continue to suck on special teams then that might be our advantage since harbaugh is a st god

if we had calais andor williams id say wed have won this but i am just so frieghtened because of henry
if williams and campbell cant go i have no faith at all titans 27 ravens 20
stop favoring us to win games i much prefer being an underdog like the good old days
i think that wed have to establish our old run game from last year and get an early lead controlling the clock

otherwise derrick henry is gonna fuck us

having calais would be huge too
ravens 28 titans 17 hollywood ices the game on an end around and trucking clowney instead of ducking out of bounds
is calais and b will out if so then henry is gonna run for 150 on us either way watching queen try to tackle him is gonna be rough
we couldnt stop the run last year and will calais and bwill out i doubt were stopping derrick henry this year our only chance is to outscore them which hasnt been easy for us this year i think this is a tough game
injuries offensive scheme playcalling lamar wanting a big play on every series instead of taking what the defense gives him and working his way down the field 1716 titans
were not playing our best football but the titans squad has plenty of injuries and issues that they are working out too we arent the team that went 142 this year but they also arent the team that came into foxborough and baltimore last year and manhandled 2 superbowl contenders

comes down to harbaugh vs vrabel who gets more out of his beat up squad
dont see the ravens being able to stop henry titans get an early lead and keep it 2713 titans

ravens saving strays to beat the steelers next week
not blaming the weather just thought it was hilarious how quickly the weather turned
actually brings up a good point hope we play colts in the playoffs so we dont have to deal with that
to be fair weather is a natural phenomenon and home field advantage generally refers to an advantage a team has based on playing at a home stadium and receiving positive interactions from the crowd and surroundings

this article is stupid
give dez a fucking chance why is he sitting on the sidelines with our clown ass receivers playing
cheer for the browns in their own stadium
had us in the first half
is this poked at that one guy
damn dude you almost had me there
the only reason this doesnt have more up votes is because people see the title and immediately are downvoting change my mind
never forget
lmao this is the type of trolling that i live for

uarcadiandelsol you still suck
i just got bucked
remember all those browns fans were like

steelers are like our bigger brothers

hell yeah lets beat the ravens for our big brother

and then lost

gross
lets go browniees so far up in the bleeders he caught strep throat from the draft
the ravens would never
i also enjoy this
this is my favorite post on this entire website

one might say its an elite post
lol
shame shame let them always remember they cheered for the browns on 30th december
as a steelers fan i watch the ravens almost every week they arent in the same time slot as us its not cause i like you guys its cause i like football and watching you lose

yeah he looks just like leron mcclain
of course michael crabtree
shouldnt have taken this long to see the ray rice resemblance lol
jk dobbins reminds me of troy smith both played at ohio state and on the ravens

great show keep up the good work

i dont think this is refs playing favoritism or anything but i do think its interesting that no defense has ever had to even try to interfere with our receivers
someone get torrey smith back in uniform
ever since harbaugh hurt the officials feelings yelling at him earlier this season we have been good for about 10 flags100yds a game
have there been any offensive holding calls against our opponents
pi calls are drawn a lot of the time our receivers dont have the ability to draw pi
they are trying to make sure the ravens lose someone has to be last i get it but some of the calls last game and the dpi in the steelers game were blatant secure the win calls
i need to check if we have brad allen for anymore games this year so i know to not watch that guy fucking sucks

the antithesis of brad allen is jerome boger boger is great
my dad is constantly telling just throw it deep and try for a dpi anytime the offense starts to stall and cant get anything going we have such a lack of threat out side that the cbs are literally realizing its not worth it just let hollywood keep tweeting and running his dog shit routes and they can relax
dont need to cheat when the wrs arent good
we dont have receivers worth interfering with
i would say that few pi calls favors the ravens humphries plays physical as hell and is a great shutdown defender if they call a game touchy both ways the ravens would have more pi calls than their opponents

he checked it down and got 17 yards thats a tough throw in those conditions take the yards
i think you severely underestimate the closing speed of defensive backs when the ball has to travel that far in the air
wouldve been a 50 yard pass between two dbs in a monsoon probably wasnt too confident in throwing anything more than 1015 yards and especially not early on before he saw how the weather was effecting the ball
you can pick many plays from every qb in the league with stuff like this every week and besides db will just close in
what in the madden are you saying if i understand correctly he got 17 yards off that check down the db on the bottom of your screen is also beginning to turn his hips to go back you now have 3 dbs running within 3 yards of hollywood by the time a soaking wet ball gets launched 45 yards down field i would question his decision making almost immediately
you cant use still images for this type or reasoning it doesnt show the whole story
yeah i saw that when they initially showed it thought brown was open it seemed like lamar saw it but i dont know if we was confident enough to try it
hes clearly double covered with the safety inside and the corner outside both following him step for step that throw is a guaranteed pick
this was one of the first plays of the game lamar went through all his reads and took a checkdown him taking a few checkdowns this game is already a good sign and shows improvement from before where he never looked at the backs in the passing game but he needs to work on seeing stuff like this thats a td if he puts the ball around where the ref is
i mean damn its raining so hard i can barely see it in this picture

luke dont call me russell willson welcome to the flock
great signing i think hell be a great pass catcher and more like hurst he was great on hard knocks last year
this is great he reminds me of a bigger sam koch who can catch the ball and block
im amazed the dude is still in the leaguehopefully he can block god knows its needed

fun fact the raiders cut him due to their new breakout te darren waller and never actually fielded luke willson
tiny tim lookin mf
so andrewswilson and someone else can fill in for blocks we can benefit from this like last year but i know that our offense wont be like last year this was just a thought i had
removed


play like a raven and win the superbowl
make that two tight ends again with luke wilson in all honesty we just roll with what we have give lamar quick passes and maybe run more spread it sucks that weve lost so much but the defense is still elite and we have a reasonable schedule to end the year hopefully a wr not named snead can step up even just a little to take pressure off lamar
get healthy sneak into the playoffs and see what happens not aimed at you at all op but the fans need to stop crying
we need to reenforce our oline in the draft i keep hearing about creed humphrey he seems like a stud priority on offense should be center wr and te in the draft
i still hold that the ol last year wasnt as good as it looked on paper lamar made a lot of mistakes not costly or even turned them positive the lack of tape on the team made the whole package more effective small wrinkles hid more than they do when teams have months to review and try to emulate or take bits

its catching up now and injuries make it worse
blame coordinators rinse and repeat
draft heavily at ol wr and edge

weve seen ozzie attack a weak position group in the draft before decosta can do the same
fire greg roman apparently
defense is better then last years as is special teams so hopefully that can compensate for the obvious drop in the offenses quality
ignore the talking heads when they criticize lamar because hes not playing with an acceptable caliber of talent on offense hope for the best and trade for proven talent in the offseason because we still cant draft and develop wrs worth a shit
this is the same reason why they are just activating dez back and forth
ugh so frustrating
not sure it was forced so much as next man up

they lost dorsey and bonds need stdb help tramon williams isnt the guy you want gunning on the punt team or trying to bang on a pulling guard stone could be
its annoying when youre a fan with purple colored glasses on and you ignore issues at hand and pretend that everything is fine pretending that were the exact same team as last year the pass blocking isnt bad and our young receiving corps is developed ect

with that being said this sub has been infiltrated with loads of doomers who act like the seasons already over suggestions that we got no realistic shot in the playoffs well almost certainly be one and done again even fans who said we wont make the playoffs at all

where is the faith in the reigning coach of the year and unanimous mvp were 63 with a top 5 defense with a strong rushing attack and lamar having another solid season as a passer

that is the kind of football that wins in january

im not saying were going to the super bowl there is too much that can happen between now and february that could change a teams trajectory what im saying is that were in a position to make a run this year a position that a lot of teams would love to be in despite all of our flaws
we need our people back on defense and we need an offense modified for the loss of stanley

its still early as fuck theres no doubt in my mind we can be extremely dangerous if we get our shit together but these gut punch error filled losses need to stop immediately
ya its definitely too early to predict playoff outcomes im confident well make it as a wildcard who knows what we and others will look like then

but this team is showing heart every week its a different issue turnovers penalties issue every week bad snaps bad play callingbut they still fight their asses off nobody has quit

we steamrolled into the playoffs last year even knocking the steelers out of contention with rg3 and the 3rd stringerslook what happened to us we played sloppy as all fuck heading into the 2012 playoffslook what happened

we just gotta keep winning pray for good health and hope the team brings its a game when it really matters

fuck the steelers
yeah harbaugh absolutely can and will right the ship and turn this team around the doom and gloom comes from the fact that last year most newer ravens fans felt like we had the championship locked up before we got absolutely btfoed by derrick henry the logic is that if we cant beat damien harris the season is basically over since we cant stop any running team

heres why its wrong we didnt have bwill or calais campbell our 2 best run defenders and we dealt with injuries all night the patriots always give afc north teams specifically trouble and they probably wont make the playoffs anyway our schedule lightens up for the rest of the season and we should make the playoffs if we just play average

what we need to improve is our offense our defense has been great all year except for the chiefs game hey its the chiefs and the patriots our offense has been straight up not good we need to get back to our roots as a run first team and we need to scheme andrewshollywoodsnead open instead of just running what weve been running we also have to use ricard more now that boyle is hurt
all i know is that we definitely arent hitting our stride too early this year
i dont want to go 142 and lose first round ravens have always done best when doubted
take away harris and what did the new england offense actually produce ive got the think that if campbell were in harris would not have broken to the edge as much as he did we played a desperate belichick at home in a monsoon im surprised the game was as clean as it was we have our challenges this year sure but im personally happy with the growth in lamar
most of the doom and gloomers tend to be fans who really know a lot about football how it is supposed to work and the nuts and bolts of why it isnt and the nature of football is that there tends to be a lot of anger when it isnt working right i think its because there are so few games compared to other sports it increases the intensity

they lose sight though that were a little over halfway through the season with no preseason as well theres a lot thats gone wrong but theres time to fix it and get together its better to be without campbell and williams now rather than at the end an offense is a lot of moving parts especially the line and they need to work things out harbaugh teams generally get better as the season goes on and thats what you want to see its not over

blind faith doesnt win games proper analysis of your strengths weaknesses does

part of being a fan means acknowledging theres areas that need work no team is perfect its too early to tell whatll happen i dont think the season is over but acknowledging how many injuries we have doesnt make you a doomer it means you watch the games and arent clueless theres some fans here who tbh arent capable of handling anything remotely negative about the ravens thats not on the fanbase thats on you im getting sick of the loyalty police on this sub were all ravens fans here talking about the season is literally what this sub is for
football is a game that is won by getting hot at the right time we sure as shit looked terrible at times before our last playoff run then caught fire it can definitely happen again hopefully this bad loss leads to actual change in the offense but i have seen harbaugh do it before and we got the personnel to do it
there is a reason we dont see more undefeated seasons losing humbles and provides coachable moments trust in our players and coaches
i think theres a few different types of doomers here

1 overly invested ravens fans who hedge their bets and saywe wont even make the payoffs in order to curb their expectations and possible disappointment these people invest too much into football and are extremely reactionary
2 bandwagon fans when the team isnt setting records and looking like the best team in the league theyre unhappy
3 new fans young people who have been watching football for a year or two and have been drawn to the ravens success last year they have very little perspective
lamar having another solid season as a passer

sorry but fucking lol if lamar was having a solid passing season we would be better than 63 lamars limitations as a passer is why we have 2 losses

hollywood and ab are in this video 002013

very underrated movie wish they made a sequel

im not really into collage football i just know some of the guys coming out of collage to the pros but i heard lamar was in a pretty complicated offense during his collage days why cant we transition that to the nfl or are we pretty much running the same offense he was playing in louisville
this just reminded me how ass our defense was outside of jaire lmfao we had lamar lighting it up but look at those score lines
im hearing just now lamar jackson scored another touchdown against charlotte

after seeing a muffed punt return last night proche deserves some love for securely handling every punt under the lights in the pouring rain im not sure what is stopping him from getting on the field on offence but his sure hands could have been used
hes not very explosive but hes secure with the ball and makes good decisions
proche deserves some love for securely handling every punt

lmao the bar is so low after hester
hes the best returner weve had in half a decade

edit i mean punt returner
his catch on the onside kick vs philli was pretty clutch ball took an awkward bounce and he attacked it
ravens as an organization seem extra hard on rookies as far as playing time goes kinda frustrating from where im sitting but im sure they have thier reasons myself id be letting him have some of boykins reps dez too gotta try something to get these wr motivated hollywood looked like a boy playing men for real against the pats
ravens cant really develop receivers and if they do they are terrible at it the last successful receiver i think they drafted and hung onto was torrey smith who enjoyed the thrill of 4th and flacco pi calls
dont jinx him shhhh

this is real ravens football anxiety riddled and very choppy at times one good season and some band wagon fans later and we forgot our selfs

i dont like when we have prime time games i live in denmark so when we do have prime time games im unable to watch them live as it is in the middle of the night for me

also fuck the steelers
im with you even living in baltimore an 820 game ends at 1130 its midnight by the time im asleep and i get up at 5

i wish nfl started games at 7 like baseball and nhl granted those are non prime time games
man i hate late games right there with you
yeah i live in maryland and prime time games usually end just before midnight and i got to get up at like 6 the next day so it leaves me contemplating whether i should just skip the game entirely to get more sleep and watch it the next day especially since our prime time games this year really have been ugly and honestly not fun to watch then again i should be used to ugly ravens games that is ravens football i just got way to comfortable last year when we were blowing out teams every week
im 6 hours ahead so when those 820 games begin its 220 at night here
especially now with covid most people are already home monday night could easily be played at 7 west coasters wouldnt suffer lol
this season primetime games havent been great last season they were but i understand the sentiment
my boss really hates them as i watch all the games live and take days off after prime time games netherlands here so ive got the same time slot as you
man i just live one time zone away and i still have a hard time staying awake for those 930 games lol
man ive been fucked all season every 1 oclock game ive been working until at least 4 and maybe make it home to watch the last half of the 3rd quarter the few prime time games ive had to work at 5 or 6 am on monday so i cant stay up

how much
how much for the lamar in a case
6 1 6 3 height range

how hard is this lol
this is the type of evaluation thats lead us to such bad receivers over the yearsoh you tall come be a raven oh you fast well take you with a 1st round pick

no how about we find some real talent instead of physical attributes
breshad perriman 62


i rest my case
a wrs job on a passing play is to 1 run the right route 2 get open and 3 catch the pass or 4 block for the guy who caught the pass the ravens have struggled with guys who are not good at 1 or 2 for most of the teams history guys who can block have been easier to find than guys who can reliably catch
well if it were that easy we would have a few

there are more pieces making up the ngatan armor set
we need matthew judon
kingdoms of alumar
game was developed by big huge games which is located in timonium
theres also greaves of harbah
how can his finesse be rated zero after this play

well i misread it but its reason enough to post an elite play like this
15 when fighting rapists
kingdoms of amalur originally published by 38 studios was developed by big huge games located in timonium
theres a character named clayton suggs in game of thrones who im pretty sure is based off him
thats awesome

this is cool as fuck never heard about this
our defense is amazing when healthy however weve been spoiled on offense by lamar lets not forget we are the ravens and have built our franchise reputation with our brand of defense weve won a title with dilfer at qb and have won both rings as a wild card team im comfortable with where were at doesnt mean we cant improve internally in areas but i have faith we can let teams underestimate us because thats when the raven historically shine we just need to peak and stay disciplined at the right time because at our best we can beat any team any given sunday i think we peaked too early or got too cocky going into the playoffs last year this year is different sorry for the rant but some fans need to be reminded of what ravens football is

edit absolutely nothing wrong with criticizing our team and pointing out weaknesses but some fans have been complete doomers and probably bandwagoners for example yes skura had a bad game but fans threatening his family is unacceptable and not the fanbase we are at our core
didnt both of the sb wins come through the wildcard route

im frustrated with some of these losses but ill easily get over it with a sb ring last year was a great run but didnt finish like we wanted
this is a normal ravens season last year was the weird one if this season happened last year everyone would be very optimistic and saying how good of a season it is we set some incredibly high standards in 2019
we wont win anything until we get proper leadership not saying its 100 his fault but harbaugh has won a grand total of 1 playoff game since that super bowl we cant play from behind and the second we face any type of adversity the team falls apart
i get what youre saying

but both super bowl teams and defenses had 1000 more heart than this team does

sorry but we seem deflated and all over place patriots have had their share of injuries and embarrassed us on national television after barely skating by the jets

the one thing we have going for is youth and this team will be in contention for years to come but im not holding my breath for a deep playoff run this year
ive said it before but we were spoiled last year we arent used to having a team that breaks nfl records were not used to having a team that doesnt have to struggle thats what we had last year last year was special but weve come to expect that and that expectation might not be realistic
people keep forgetting we are 63
a lot of us have lost the truzz we once had and i am big enough to admit that there have been points throughout this season where i have questioned my own truzz levels but never will i say the season is over never will i say i enjoy to watch the steelers play one good game and all of our truzz will come back to us
i think its not just that were losing its that we have a bunch of young talent and fans dont want to waste it i think it was easier to accept losing without a lot of talent and stuff but now that we have the mvp were just impatient and dont want to waste away his career
our line is decimated by injuries and lamar has not looked very good at all really this year our defense is decimated by injuries if we were just playing poorly then sure but the mounting injuries are really concerning and regardless of the cliches like next man up injuries can and do bring down a team theres a reason the bench guys are on the bench
i understand what happened last year but the offense moved the ball most of the night they turned it over 3 times didnt convert 4th downs 3 or 4 times gave the titans great field position all night settled for 2 fgs etc if big baby and calais are out is henry gonna run through the defense again sure probably but if the ravens dont give the titans great field position damn near everytime they touch the ball its an extremely winnable game

my dad is a titans fan so i have watched most of the games tennessees defense is a train wreck they get no pressure they cant cover anything and they have their share of injuries and guys not producing at the level they should they do an ok job at stopping the run but we saw what the colts did to them and thats with phillip rivers at qb

am i saying the ravens are going to win by 20 points no but the ravens are a team that is being written off by just about everyone and they think just cuz that playoff game happened 8 months ago the titans are gonna waltz back into the bank and do it all over again realistically the ravens could have scored a lot more than 12 points in that playoff game i think the ravens are going to turn a lot of heads this week and itll be with the offense this time the defense wont be able to save anyone from henry but they will be able to bend without breaking

tldr have a little faith the ravens are better than well we and everyone else thinks
when you set your expectations low enough you cant be disappointed anymore and if youre wrong its a happy surprise
no brandon williams or campbell not confident at all that d can stop them from scoring and henry from running for 9 yards a clip and id be fine with that but that means greg roman is gonna call a bunch of stupid shit on 3rd and 4th down to turn the ball over and give points away

the only way i see this game not collapsing fast is if they can score first and keep a lead and not have to worry about playing catchup if im the ravens and i win the coin toss im starting with the ball
were missing a lot of guys
bwill is out and calais probably will be too we got calais for one reason and he happens to be out when we needed him most lol derrick henry is going stomp on us plus the titans had 10 days to prepare for us

i still have faith this team can pull a surprise and beat them but the prospects dont look great
we are our record so tough to be confident but no real reason to think we cant win unless we cant plug up the middle of the d line
if queen and harrison play the run like they did on snf we could be in trouble hoping fort is back this week
we just lost to a 2 win team
i understand that january was ugly but why is everyone acting like this dude is impossible to defend we played him twice before 2017 l 2023 2018 w 210 and he didnt make much noise in either game at all

weve played well against him twice
pats just dominated our defense and the tits offense is 20 times better also our offense was ok i guess but roman still has some questionable playcalling and its getting to the point where lamar is just dragging us along with no help from anyone else
if williams and campbell are both out we will not be able to slow down derrick henry so far the offense has not proven they can pick up the slack if the defense falters so its pretty simple math i think they should be favored in the game by a few points to be honest but that doesnt mean we cant win
i mean yeah but also we just lost to the pats who are quantifiably worse than the titans in almost every measure but kicker
its a different year w loads of injuries derrick henry could rush for 300 yards
styles make fights and the titans are a bad matchup for us theyre a well coached powerrunning team with extended prep time and were down our two best runstoppers

cluster injuries have left us thin on both sides of the trenches

add in the fact that our offense has an identity crisis and our most productive wr would be who ohhh thats right wr3 in most other offenses and you can see why some people are not lining up to bet the ravens this week

last weeks game isnt indicative of what this teams capable of but the fact is we are really banged up
because williams and campbell are the foundation of our run defense its true you can contain henry if the big guys are the ones putting hands on him instead of dbs but i just dont see how really doing it without one of those two guys playing especially with how iffy the playcalling has been im optimistic though but im not gonna set my expectations super high
this is our moms spaghetti game
the main reason is because theres a very high chance we could be without big baby and calais and if that is the case henry will run for 200 dont get me wrong i have confidence in lamar wink harbs but that 22 is a baaaaaad man if we cant stop him the game could be a lot like the pats game
generally how it tends to go is that we trade ws and ls against one another if history holds well win but yeahim not feeling good about it either
if bwill and campbell were at 100 or even 70 i would feel better
the titans have the 30th run defense and henry only shows up to half the games anyway

its a very winnable game if you god damn negative nancys fuck off
we will be so fixated on stopping henry aj brown is going to have a monster game
this is ravens football an anxiety filled season even though everyone and everything is pitted against us i have a feeling lamar is about to take off and show his mvp caliber self to end the season lets keep the morale
tbh i hope we do get a wildcardwhich probably will happen and are back to being one of those underdog teams that no one wants to face in the playoffs
we can make a run with a wildcard spot these next two games are extremely important at this point we just need to win more games than the browns or maybe the steelers lose to us the colts and bills this season is very interesting
i agree nice username by the way
i just hope to make the playoffs as a wild card and win one game ill be more than happy with that with all the big injuries were dealing with also we have to beat the steelers then ill be truly satisfied

woo woot
truzz
i am endeavoring to feel more trust
week 11 and the hits keep coming our all pro newly paid left tackle went down in week 8 matt skura has had his snapping issues along with mobility issues still struggling to get to the second level tyre phillips is on short term ir and may return within the next few weeks dj fluker was pulled after getting beat like a drum this shifted patrick mekari to rt and ben powers to rg
i for one am excited to see powers get a shot if this is the offensive line that rolls out on sunday what say you ravens fans who do you think the best starting 5 would be at this point
per harbaugh today mekari has been taking reps at center and skura was being plugged in for where phillips would be when he is healthy and where fluker would be in different reps this will continue for the week until they have a better idea of the health of the line so there is a healthy competition for the center job this week but i feel like skura keeps it come game day on a short leash
brown jrbozemanmekaripowersphillips

obviously the least experienced combination but i think skuras play is still suffering from tearing up his knee and mekari is kind of an awkward fit at rt
i think skura would be decent for us if he didnt have to snap the ball considering our oline health hopefully he can fill in well for tyree and give us some options

the upper deck crowds were social distancing before it became cool
my favorite game of last season by far
was at that game it was so amazing by the second half it was nearly all ravens fans
bro i was there too sat right on the fifty 6 rows from the front monster ass game
is it likely no will it be easy no is it possible definitely

edit in this thread people dont understand what kinda means

second edit jesus christ you guys need to fucking relax its just football it was a joke haha their thanksgiving is rooeened feels like you guys are one natty bo short of sending a pipebomb to my house should i go into hiding because the fans of my favorite nfl team are cranky about a reddit post

me rn
wtf is all of this rooting for the steelers bullshit lately

no fuck that i hope they lose every single game now and forever more amen
heck nah if they lose and lose to us next week and we win vs titans and themwe back in it for the division
the fuck is happening to ravens fans the steelers winning hurts the ravens directly


i get it if we were an 28 team and had no chance to compete and wanted to play spoiler for an undefeated steelers you should hope the steelers lose every game going forward until the division is clinched
id think as ravens fans wed root for them to go 016 every year
fuck the steelers and fuck you can we start voting people out who post dumb shit like this
i was thinking about it too and i kinda hope they go 190 this year to win the super bowl then they go 190 the following year to win another super bowl ben rides off into the sunset after the win on a motorcycle followed by his harem of women and he hands the keys to the team to legendary steeler mason rudolph

while i am at it i think ill also marry my cousin drown all of my food in fucking heinz ketchup and jam a qtip too far in my ear to lower my intelligence a bit so i fit in with my new steelers friends

fuck the steelers
no
do not i repeat do not vote for ngakoue to make the probowl there is a stipulation in his contract that gives him a bonus from the jags and their trade with minnesota that gives jacksonville a higher pick from minnesota which then in turn bumps our 5th round pick next year to a 4th round

i love it not gona lie
but those almostpressures hes getting
im not voting for him because he doesnt deserve it
who cares he is a raven i would be happy for him if he made the probowl fan vote is only a 3rd of it anyways
haha probowl vote go brrr
what has he done so far thats pro bowl worthy

offense podcast with clifton brown of the ravens including

ol scoring for a reconfigured line
why fluker was benched at halftime
how may the ravens move forward in terms of the ol by position
how can the ravens offense function without nick boyle
removed
really what are the alternatives out here its fine
likeable personality is a decent blocker and catcher but not a game changer solid signing given our current situation
hes a warm body who has played te in the nfl before so thats ok i guess at this point its not good when youre bringing a guy from his couch onto your roster but it is what it is
i like that hes mastered the art of chill
nothing flashy but its really one of the best moves we could have made

id be feeling much better about it if we still had boykin

edit boyle not boykin
we need someone anyone lol im ok with it
is delanie walker healthy

he can block and he can catch we need a te that can block and catch everything checks out

one of the biggest issues i think we are having this year is moving to 23 wide sets and dumping the 3 te sets from last year our offense has suffered a bit because of it now we lose boyle for the year this offense is just not built to run without tes that can also block options are pretty limited out there at the moment outside of a trade wilson is the next best option
i never really watched him much either but looking at his stats and some articles from the past three or so years he seems solid decent hands from what i read hes a good blocker too hes definitely not nick but considering the position were in it seems like a good pickup
i like that hes canadian
i liked him on hard knocks other than that id have no clue who he was
hes from my hometown so i think itd be cool if he played for my favourite team
wow
he could be used for blocking along with andrews and richard
can he block
owen is going to be so jealous
ravens fan in seahawk territory here

wilson is a decent tight end and was doing fine on the seahawks but i think they were more focused on using wide outs and trying to bolster defense so they cut him

frankly with our lack of depth at the tight end spot i think its the best option available to us at the moment
as a canadian ravens fan i have to love the move its canadian law
as a canadian i approve
i feel like he could end up looking like a stud on a team that heavily relies on its tes so im looking forward to how he plays
i think its embarrassing that we have to recruit washed up bums to try to fix our offense
i wish we signed delanie walker instead

went to the same college as lamar too
theres a haircut you can set your watch to
notice how this is posted here and not the colts page what a legend
lucky duck
i wonder how much that thing would go for
i have a couple pages of a notebook from the front desk at um hospital where i was standing one day waiting to find out what room my girlfriends mother was in and johnny u walked in i felt weird even asking him in that setting but i did anyway and he couldnt have been more gracious in singing something for me so glad i got a chance to meet him and shake his hand im sure those papers are worthless to anyone else but its definitely a priceless memory for me
goat
although irsaten will probably say hes an indianapolis icon because hes a dick
johnny came to my elementary school a couple months before he passed for career day i was so happy that i signed up for sports as a career he was one of the nicest guys i have had the pleasure of meeting he was supposed to send everyone that attended an autograph but unfortunately he never got the chance to i definitely need to get some johnny u memorabilia
i jumped on the raven bandwagon when ray lewis came back and won us the super bowl in 13 who is this dude real quick
lol before i scrolled further down i fully expected it to be bert jones
i remember as a teenager in 1958 watching the nfl championship game the greatest game ever played johnny u drove the colts 80 yards
in overtime to defeat the new york football giants 2317 in my opinion perhaps unitas was the goat quarterback
cool but wrong franchise
i honestly think we are mostly okay had a bad stretch of injuries but hopefully we can get our way out and hit our stride however we have some issues and i just want to cast out into the void what id like to see as a fan next game

i hope next game we see makeri at center ben powersskura at rg bozeman at lg orlando at lt and phillips at rt until were all healthy again i also hope we bring up xavier grimble just in case anything bad happens to another te hes okay and has won a super bowl also maybe some boykin at te and have devin and hollywood switch off at the 2 with snead in the one bring up dez so he can get some work in when we need big sets him on boykin both on the outside with snead in the slot mandrews and luke wilson in sounds dangerous inside the 10 overall i hope jk dobbins and gus edwards get 7 carries each with mark ingram and jackson only taking 45 each

i think defensively if brandon williams is out we need to bring jihad ward in and have derek wolfe play a bigger role maybe switching inside with jihad ward a little to help stop derrick henry hopefully jimmy smith can play because he seriously is a force in stopping outside runs especially with deshon elliot and chuck clark
i like most of what you said tyre at rt doesnt sound like a good idea to me though he couldnt handle the rg position so i doubt hes be able to handle rt

that being said im not sure what the answer is orlando and bozeman on the left side is the only thing i really have confidence in for the o line mekari will definitely play somewhere but i dont know where

outside of those 3 someone out of skura powers fluker and tyre really needs to step up
isnt tyre on ir
also maybe some boykin at te

and while were at it lets put richard in at center
agree here with everything but stop henry contain is a better word look at last week they got blown out and he still had 100 yard game keys is to obviously not let him score but you have to a score points your self and limit rt from beating you which is why we lost last year

offense has to have 23 td on their own and defense has to set up another one
i think now is time to try boykin out at te he has good hands and a big body cant be worse than wr for him

this post is dumb as shit

put gus back in the starter role
its crazy how putting lamar in lead us to go from 45 essentially season over to 106 considering hes a rookie he almost beat mahomes in his mvp season as a rookie if it werent for some 4th down plays

glad we made the change and have him as our qb even if things arent going well at the moment hes a qb for the future even if we dont do much this year
its really surprising realizing that gus edwards was an udfa
i can only afford to go to one game a year i happened to choose this game months beforehand it was awesome to be there for his first start and seeing the future of the franchise begin
this is actually a thing that makes me a little nuts when i see lamar jackson rushing per game over his first 40 games

if you actually just look at his stats since he became the starter and dont count games where he came in for two plays his numbers go from best ever to what the actual fuck in a lot of categories
i really forget that the two eras of ravens football ie flacco brown collins overlapped with jackson

watching jackson handoff to alex collins throw to brown but then also throw to mandrews is weird
its been 2 years and i still cant tell how food gus is
if you told me 2 years ago gus would still be on our team and be remotely productive i would have called you a little bitch

but now im the little bitch a very happy little bitch
so fun fact this was actually my first ever ravens game after being a fan for years i kept putting off driving down until i found someone to go with which never happened so i finally said screw it and got a ticket to go alone on the 30 yard line that week they announced lamars start which had me hyped got to see a rival game and when i was in the stadium looking for poe to get a picture with him i ended up meeting jacoby jones instead
2 years already shits crazy
you guys think giving gus 39 would be smart i wouldnt be opposed to it he works really well with lamar
and still looking for a playoff win
i know im a week early but i wont be on much due to work in the next week but i just wanted to wish you guys a happy thanksgiving i love you guys like family i hope you guys have a great day and i hope your victorious over the titans
have a safe thanksgiving dude were hoping to avenge the titans
have fun
dude love you too hope you have an amazing thanksgiving and dont worry the titans will be crushed
we dont celebrate thanksgiving here but wish you guys have a great time with your families and friends on the other side of the atlantic
youre my favorite packers fan on the ravens sub happy thanksgiving man stay safe
you love strangers that post on the ravens reddit sub like family
happy thanksgiving dude you are always welcome at the ravens table
love ya jordy have a happy early thanksgiving

go pack go
happy thanksgiving to you too
enjoy your progressively colder thanksgiving as well
love you too man
happy thanksgiving to you too bro and to the rest of the american flock

fun fact there is a theory that it actually comes from my hometown leiden

according to historian jeremy bangs director of theleiden american pilgrim museum the pilgrims may have been influenced by watching the annual services of thanksgiving for the relief of thesiege of leidenin 1574 while they were staying in leiden12now calledoktober feestleidens autumn thanksgiving celebration in 1617 was the occasion for sectarian disturbance that appears to have accelerated the pilgrims plans to emigrate to america

ol scoring vs patriots including

a sharp division between skura as a blocker and skura as a snapper
mekaris debut at rt
powers performance at rg
how are the ravens likely to line up versus tennessee

you cut out cecil county which i dont think many would object to nice work
clean

meanwhile everyone is calling him potential defensive rookie of the year
he sucked on sunday but hes a rookie

saw him multiple times come forward to stop the run but hit the backs of the dl while the wide open hole is a spot to the side those are the gaps he needs to fill
if you were watching any part of last weeks game you would understand why dude hasnt developed his coverage skills yet and hes gettin killed for it
i love queens potential and athletic ability but people get so enticed by flash plays despite his athleticism he gets beat in coverage a ton because hes so athletic he is around the ball a ton but misses a lot of tackles

pffs grades arent going to always match the eye test thats a feature not a bug
i will never worry about a linebackers development within this organisation never
he still has a lot to work on but he will be fine he didnt even start a full year of college football and now hes the starting ilb for the ravens thats a huge jump
i dont really get the queen hate he has had some rookie struggles in coverage but he also had a shortened offseason and asking any late 1st rounder to start as a rookie without a full training camp is a big ask especially one who didnt have a ton of play experience in college he has shown tons of great flashes his speed blitzing tackling is all solid pff only has his score low due to coverage and pff grades are shit anyways he will develop in coverage he will develop at everything we drafted him because of his insane upside not where he is now
the score is mainly the result of 23 very bad games and part of his bad game last week is understandable given that he didnt have williams and campbell in front of him even ray lewis had trouble when we had issues up front on our dline like in 2005
the elite and experienced coaches seems to know how to exploit p queen
pq is best rookie lb in my opinion other top rated lbs kenneth murray jordyn brooks isaiah simmons and willie gay jr have been ok but i think pq is the best of the bunch hes not cj level yet the young man needs time to develophes just turned 21

growing pains are inevitable but i think he and malik will grow and develop to be formidable in the next couple years
its so weird we knew since college that he was a bad tackler the idea was that hed be a coverage guy

but he sucks at tackling and covering now like whats the point
he was impossible to watch sunday night its rare to see a linebacker look that bad in real time but man did he look hopeless im not going to give up on the guy anytime soon but i maintain that malik harrison is the inside stalwart that this defense will be built around over the next few years i watch malik and i see a player whos headier more physical and much stronger than queen
they were showing those pff rankings and aside from marlon they were awful for us yet we have the lowest points allowed total something doesnt add up there
hes been a huge liability in coverage all season tackling has also been awful and run fits generally poor

no one with any credibility is considering him for defensive roy

all that said i think the future is bright for him hes got raw explosiveness that should translate into improved play in all facets but youre crazy if you think hes played well this season
i wouldnt worry about it pff grades for dbs and linebackers are essentially worthless since its impossible to properly evaluate those positions without knowing their exact responsibilities every play which collinsworths boys definitely dont
pff weighs pass coverage very heavily
he hasnt been great this year but as a rookie hes been fine and has a ton of potential hes super young and will be good if not great in a couple years
hes young and doesnt have much starting experience under his belt hes not a mosley type player who started in national championships and was proready hes going to be a player with coverage upside even though hes struggled coming out of the gate and relies on his speed and instincts
the pff grading system evaluates every player on every play during a football game we believe that everyplaycounts and that attention to detail provides insights and data that cannot be found anywhere else the grading system was founded on the principle of grading production rather than traits or measurables but perhaps a better way to describe it is a players contribution to production on a given play
hes had his struggles and they shouldnt be surprising im not overly worried though hes 9 games into his rookie season and he doesnt turn 22 till next august the way some people are talking about him here you would think he has no chance at improving
its hard to be a rookie linebacker probably the hardest defensive position to play also hes not good at all in coverage and honestly malik harrison has been the better rookie lb in this regard
he isnt very good supposed to come in and be a first year starter that has a huge impact turns out hes below average
pff is trash no one should take them seriously
whats your personal take on
brown bozeman fluker skura powers
skura was good last year the knee injury has took him back a couple steps bozeman is aight could for sure have someone worse playing guard brown is a stud fluker is a beast in the run game buns in pass pro and i dont know much about powers
brown is easily the best of the bunch he has done a pretty good job being thrown into the left tackle spot this year
bozeman can be solid but that is his peak
fluker is done hes just not good at tackle nor in pass protection he was fine for the seahawks at guard and in their run game however the ravens just have too much of a log jam there with all their younger olinemen
skura is hard to analyze is he still not 100 from last years injury will he ever recover to be the same guy he was in 2019 did he benefit too much from having yanda next to him we dont know for sure but hes probably better suited at guard than center moving forward especially if that cuthand injury is still bothering him
powers is too much of a mystery atm however he has the chance to prove himself on the field if the ravens elect to start him at guard for the remainder of the season

the ones you didnt mention besides stanley and bredeson

mekari is most likely the second best player on the current oline hes shown some great versatility being able to play at guard center and now right tackle his performance on sunday at right tackle was the lone bright spot for that unit against the patriots
phillips remains to be determined the coaches clearly like him giving him the starting nod at right tackle guard to begin the season but hes been one of the worst graded guards according to pff its never easy for a rookie especially a non1st or 2nd rounder to be a starter on the oline from day one so i just hope we see a big improvement from him after the offseason

edit sorry i had mekari still on my mind when i said phillips got the nod at right tackle to begin the season
brown hes great

bozeman hes fine

mekari meh

skura im convinced hes still feeling the effects of last years injury even if he says hes fine

fluker great runblocker terrible in passpro

powers bredeson
love bozeman brown had some early season struggles in pass pro but hes gotten much better and will probably net a market reset fluker is a good run blocking tackle but hes awful at pass protection skura has been awful these past two teams and average to below average before that and mekari looks really promising as a rg and would fit the mold of the swing guard we need pretty well
the line is so up and down i read kens grading each week and you never know what your gonna get brown was horrible against the pats but mekari and skura snaps aside had their best games of the year

my biggest problem is that we do t have any great run blockers stanley and brown are much better pass blockers and seem mediocre at run blocking skura mekari phillips bozeman are just a mixed bag

powers is an after thought despite never playing poorly no clue whats going on there
everyone except brown is doodoo
we are so fucked
skura needs to be cut right away he fucking sucks big cock

shiiiid hopefully so
i hope as a player he truly thinks this as a fan whos opinion doesnt effect how the team plays this is 100 a revenge game
i understand he needs to get better throwing outside the numbers etc but this man has the spirit of jordan i love him
lmao so far the most talking ive seen is from their side franchise highlight for sure for one that hasnt seen too many
idk about yall but its a must win lowkey
well probably lose since we wont have williams or campbell so henry will run all over us

damn that was such a good game automatuck
we had so much yanda
miss yanda so much
wondering why we couldnt run this exact same play in the playoff game or against pittsburgh this year
pain
its still earlyish
shouldve ran this play yesterday
ravens are 63 cheer up yall were gonna be fine
i think im actually the only person who is optimistic on this sub i wouldnt be surprised that the people who are upset with being 63 didnt experience this team during postsuperbowl years
idk how we added calais campbell jk dobbins queen and lamar with another year under his belt and got this much worse dude pain
seeing myself in the video
my wife swore shed never attended a game in december after this onethe weather too brutal for her
we did not properly gage what losing yanda would do to the team
this is the game i use as an example of what an actually good defensive battle is people often conflate bad offenses playing badly as a defensive battle no a defensive battle is when the offense can move the ball and score but its a massive struggle to do so this game perfectly illustrated it
can we all stop acting like our team fucking died in a plane crash jesus christ

were not what we were last year but were still a viable team with a good shot at winning look at our o line look at our wide receivers now look at our injuries

everyone quit acting like spoiled patriots fans

having a qb repeat an mvp year just doesnt happen

it could be worse we could be living in cleveland
we had a healthy line and defenses that hadnt adjusted yet they have and the ravens need to adjust back

this must be fake everyone knows lamar doesnt beat good teams
i was at that game last year and it was honestly one of the best games that i have ever been to watching the ravens beat the top seeded 49ers was such an incredible feeling they had so much talent and were flying high coming into that game but we showed them what it means to play like a raven meanwhile ice rain is coming down the entire time hell of a win
its gotta be the black on black uniforms
need those all black unis coming out more in big games

that brickwall up front
exactly one team one has since the year 2000 won more super bowls than your baltimore ravens in that time the ravens have had only four losing seasons and played postseason football in twelve of those seasons

dry your eyes count your blessings and show up on sunday

geez there are lots of bad and mediocre football teams out there this time right here in this video and in this sub aint one of them edit im not saying dont be critical just dial down the woeisme selfpity bullshit
yea and we got destroyed in the wild card
time to vote for our guys dont forget to show love to our st
outside of humphrey i honestly dont know if i can vote in any other raven over some other talent out there stanley would have been an easy one but of course the injury happened i guess my other votes will be for orlando brown chuck clark and campbell
and dont vote yannick in this time
realistically who deserves to go no ones been that impressive this year sadly
we need to get behind an edge defender to vote into the pb over yannick

steeler fans and bengals as well
lol might as well just accept its a 4th at this point lol
does that sorry ass team even have a large enough fanbase to pull that off

fuck jacksonville and fuck our spiteful division rivals
i think our offense needs a spark in creativity look around the league the teams that have offensively innovative head coaches are looking great chiefs cardinals rams packers tampa dallspre dak im not talking solely off record im talking about the offense on those teams is making the job of the defense easier harbaugh isnt an offensive head coach or a defensive head coach hes a motivator who is only as good as our coordinators greg roman was great for the first 1012 games last year and then hasnt adjusted since our defense throughout the years has been above average to elite but offensively other than with roman last year and kubiak in 2014 its been very below average caldwell in 1213 was nice but we also had weapons im open to some friendly discussion bc watching film on this team offensively is embarrassing and its not as much on lamar as it is on scheme and lack of talent at wr
well i definitely disagree with this take

cant read any of that unless you admit you meant to typs oc
harbaugh is unmoveable for the next few years
warning warning warning

you are now entering a newphew take zone

proceed with caution
wtf this sub has gone crazy

begone with you nephew
if harbaughs gone as head coach it would be a huge blow to team morale
tbh i dont much about him but id be willing to put money that some maybe even a large part of their success has to do with the ungodly amount of talent that offense has
this sounds like my fire billick hire marty schottenheimer take said only to my friends not posted anywhere online sadly back in 2007 after the playoff loss to the colts

its certainly possible for a very successful head coach to grow stale with his team after a few years like andy reid did in philly but anyone thinking we need to replace harbaugh needs to think very carefully were 63 not 36 were not cincinnati or cleveland or the jets weve had two truly disastrous seasons in 20 years and harbaugh wasnt the coach in either of those seasons consistency is an asset for this organization and if youre going to throw that away it better be for a good reason not because the team lost 3 games two of them really close games and one to the best damn team in the conference if not the nfl
were not going to get rid of harbaugh at this point bienemy will go to houston and get an mvp season out of watson we probably need to scour the college coaching ranks for a creative up and coming coach ravens oc should actually be an attractive position for a change
hello everyone

here is the link for the week 11 nfl picks



the leaderboard from this week and the link for next week will be announced on tuesday or wednesday no more picks can be made after 1000 pm on saturday night good luck

im going around looking for every teams best player in history whos yours
ray lewis
gotta be ray lewis
what would you give if tomorrow wasnt promised
ray lewis
ray lewis
ray lewis is probably the most important in terms of building an identity as well as being an incredible hofer i personally would choose ed reed though in terms of who was the best player we had
ray lewis ed reed ogden tucker yanda suggs
buck allen
ed
only two players have statues in front of our stadium ray lewis and johnny u
ed reed
in order ray lewis jonathan ogden ed reed marshall yanda justin tucker terrell suggs
johnny unitas
theres a lot of ravens greats but none that stand out as much as ray lewis undeniably one of the best to ever play the position but i think more importantly he was consistently for his entire career the spark to the powder keg that was the ravens identity a leader of men on the field a field general the coaching staff could put complete faith in and played with an insatiable hunger and unending drive to be the best and demanded the same of his teammates on both sides of the ball

no player in ravens history has managed to have the impact that ray lewis has had and to a degree continues to have on the entire organization he defined what it means to play like a raven selfless hard nosed tough physical football putting the team above oneself
ray lewis jon ogden ed reed justin tucker terrell suggs marshall yanda
ray lewis
ed ray and jonathan ogden are among the alltime best at their positions so the separation is between them is miniscule

that said ray gets the edge for his role as the general he was a legend on the field and off the field putting him at the top of the list


click on each team and they give you the top 12 players for each franchise for the ravens its ray lewis and its not particularly close
the buck allen
ogden
justin tucker not even close

i also like how ogden looks out of place due to his heightweight compared to the defenders but being 69 and 350lbs will do that


here he is next to ray lewis


the classic high school photo as well

we need to stuff ellis and madubuike together into a 98 jersey and try to pass them off as brandon williams the width would be about right anyway
fuck
shit
pain
imma stay sleep
you guys should visit our sub a bunch of our starters are down as well

the doom and gloom in both of our subs is rather interesting one of us is gonna finish sunday in a very bad mood
henry is about to set the new rushing yards record against us tomorrow
danger
if mp juiceman can take down derrick henry so can everybody else
i have a feeling that the defense will rise to the challenge and only give up 175 and 2 tds
goddamn it
understatement
so now were on the hope arthur smith pulls a roman and refuses to run the ball against an awful run d train
good thing i have to work today so i dont get to see henry break the single game rushing record against my team
as much as it sucks they need to heal up back end of the schedule is soft here soon can definitely finish 115
this is going to be a major asshole gaping exercise i highly suggest ample lube
well i will take a miracle for this front 7 to stop the run the only way i see them mitigating this is if the offense can roll and get ahead so much it forces the titans to through more
henry for 178yikes
offense just has to finish cant fall behind early receivers mishandling passes that they had been tucking away all year is what set us up to have to play from behind last year which is what killed us if the o is efficient early today well be fine if not it will be another long day vs titans same case as last year
key to the game is going to be efficiency on offense imo titans are set up to dictate the game of given the ball ravens will have to make every possession count
get healthy monstars
literally drafted and spent offseason to not get henryd and now theres a high possibility ravens get fucked up yet again because injuries cool
bright spot malik harrison taking down henry with one arm and being blocked with the other
not a dark lord but a queeeeennnn terrible as the dawn

how did u do this with 100 passing yards
those player stats dont add up who was scoring
you allowed 139 yards pathetic
fuck the steelers
lmaoo yo i thought i was the only one that did this
fuck the tits
oooo yea ready for 5 pat ricard tds 350 ow ow ow
man im ready but the ptsd flashbacks keep haunting me
i am trying to get excited but im just not optimistic about this game whatsoever
caw caw
hopefully this is where we start to turn the corner because were better than this
dont ya know a flock of ravens is called a conspiracy
please beat the tits i wanna actually be happy today
yea thats right ive watched 3 ravens game this year we lost all 3 of them therefore i wont watch tomorrow
either you get player of the game or you break the curse and get to watch some ravens games this year
listen on the radio in 2011 i listened to games at work on the radio and they won them all the ones i watched on tv when i wasnt working including the afc championship with the dropped catch and missed kickugh
thank you for your service
i didnt watch almost all of last season cause of my work schedule i threw a very successful party for the titans gamei wont be watching today either
i watched four total games

all of chiefs pats steelers

and the second half of the eagles and first half of the colts game i aint too lucky right now either
this piece of shit got curious in ot didnt he
i figure we are all lucky to even get a chance to see football this weekend i was sure the pandemic might truncate the season it still may so watch the game and enjoy yourself you arent a curse to the team youre part of the flock
youre doing gods work
welp it didnt work you can start watching again
you better not watch
well now we know its not you lol were just trash
same here lmao
must have been checking the feed on his phone dammit
you can watch again
watch the game
i have recently discovered a godgiven gift that i have i have the ability to make any team lose just by placing a bet on them i have already placed a sizable bet on the steelers this week unfortunately this gift comes at a cost literally

might have to start a go fund me page to help us get that ring this year
seems like you werent the problem
it looks like you are allowed to watch games again
reminds me of the chiefs fan who left the divisional round game last year when they were losing
thank you for your service
ive noticed a correlation to prime time games and our losses
all of us thank you for your sacrifice
good news you arent cursed
its not you its us failing to win the big games watch tomorrow this team needs to figure out how to win big games its pathetic
you have zero impact on the result sorry peace
ive just watch all our games so idk what yall are talking about xd
i want to like this post but it has 52 likesim not touching that
thank you i was wondering why weve been so off
same as an nyc based flock member ive only been able to see the 2 primetime games and the tail end of one after the regularly scheduled game ended all ls feels bad man
tyjk we just dont have that mojo this yr
thank you for sacrificing yourself for the greater good consider yourself a great flock member and great american
youre better than me i cant go through that pain again
we only get really just a few games to watch a season watch the games
just watch my man ive been to 4 ravens games in my life live in ny went to the ny back to back games against giants and jets 2016 which we lost both then managed to make my way to lamars first playoff game against the chargers which we also lost so i was 03 i decided to go to the new england game last year on snf and now im 13
i thought we were going to be undefeated when we didnt have fans this year because every game i go to we lose my theory is that i used up all my luck watching us beat the steelers in 2015 you know the game

my current streak 2016 at giants 2018 playoffs vs chargers and 2019 vs browns at home i was going to go to the browns game in 2018 at home last game of the season so youre all welcome for me not going
i thank you for your proactivity
take my free award
same being a ravens fan in slovenia is hard
gamepass is great just watch after the fact lol
i just learned that i cant watch the upcoming steelers game and im quite upset not upset enough to skip my nieces play virtual but upset

hopefully today soothes my pain
nah bro its my fault seriously

every game mirrors the prior week in my life if ive done well attended to work watched my diet avoided drama we win the year we won the sb for example i got a scholarship to law school and had broken up with a toxic ex the dark years that followed i was struggling with addiction and family problems the year we drafted lamar is when i made major life changes and broke that cycle

past few weeks ive been falling behind on grad school homework and been pigging out but this past week ive fucking buckled down and also made some good stock trades so im fully confident we win this
because thats what heros do
thank you for your service sir
its working
this is fucking sad
i take it that you must have tuned in after all
we suck
jesus christ
well this didnt work
i just wanted to note that i truly didnt watch the game
it really doesnt matter
thanks you sir
listen mr pjexpat keep ur eyes off the game plz and thanks
1 wood floats

2 wood burns

3 witches burn

conclusion if she floats the is a witch

watch the game and try to enjoy yourself
browns fans went a whole season watching 16 games and they all lost yet they kept watching dont not watch cause you have watched only losses
dont do that to yourself our interior ol will play like trash whether you watch or not if you want to watch it happen just do it
this did not age well

mekari played well last season if im correct lets go big shot
i thought we were gonna move him to guard or something
this shouldve been done 2 games ago the snaps have been a disgrace and im sure hell come back stronger but we literally lost a game last week because of it
feel bad for skura but this is the right call you cant be an nfl center missing snaps like that
i get that everyone plays hurt but when it affects your play enough that you cant do the bare minimum just rest up big man
while moving matt skura out of the center position needed to be done pronto i would much rather have bradley bozeman at center while keeping patrick mekari at right tackle meaning skura and ben powers would be the two guards center was bozemans natural position in college and the ravens even keep him in their discussions during the offseason to be the starting center this year had skura not recovered by seasons start i get that mekari has the actual nfl experience at the position but what does that mean for right tackle especially after mekari held his own there last week in the second half

is dj fluker seriously going to be back in the starting line up at right tackle oh jeez
a week too late but i honestly was really concerned we would ride with him im even okay with him at guard he just has the yips he cant snap tje ball thats the only thing that must occur on every play if you cant snap you dont play its be like if i renovate bathrooms and all i do is shit in the toilet no ones gonna hire me
so how does the rest of the line shake out will it be skura bredeson powers or fluker at rg and then fluker or holden at rt i was expecting the line to be brownskurabozemanpowersmekari before this came out
i thought he was still doing good at blocking just shit at snapping
good its about damn time
tough week for skura this is the best possible move though
so whos gonna be right tackle
tune in this week as the oline turns
no matter who starts today they are gonna get mauled simmons is a beast also a pos who spat on yanda supposedly in the playoff loss
awesome start to the game man i mean really
after struggling last week to snap in key moments

key moments most of the game
please dont die llama
we can breathe easily now
skura slander getting downvoted to hell in here lol
move skura to replace mekari on the line
good if skura is such a good blocker we can just move him to tackle but he has lost his right to play center for the time being


hes not a bust hes been well worth his pick

that said im in the camp of not paying him the mega deal hes gonna command because i dont think hes the type that can win with a lesser overall team like a wilsonmahomes nearly every qb who gets those mega deals ends up seeing their teams regress quite a bit
i think he is having his sophomore season a year late he is a great qb and will continue to be one until he retires
stop going on rnfl ravens threads invariably you get the usual flairs posting racist shit
should the ravens move on from the 2nd unanimous mvp in nfl history who led one of the top 10 offenses in the past 30 years all in his 1st full season as a starter

i dunno thats a tough one
removed
i get the feeling romo says all the right things about lamar but low key he doesnt think hes very good i feel like his praise is fake

hope he balls out today and makes romo mean it

view poll
regardless about how he personally may feel about our team i really enjoy romo calling games hes very good at articulating his thoughts on air which mean a lot because i know hes a former player all other commentators sound clueless or senile imo
i like romo calling any game tbh hes entertaining and he really knows what hes talking about i actually think hes one of the most nuanced broadcasters out there
does he know lamars name does he call him kyler murray for 3 quarters no then he cool
hes the best color guy out there but he seems to root against us thats likely because the only games of ours he is assigned to are when were playing a big market team
im proud to have made it 69 for fuck the steelers
hes no kevin harlan but yes i like his commentary
romo is a great announcer i dont think he dislikes lamar if anything the opposite
agreed
hes obviously good but i just cant seem to forget when he said something along the lines of i cant think of anyone besides butker who could make that kick

i know its petty but i cant get that tucker slight out of my head
lol it sounds like youre inventing a reason to be defensive about lamar

romo is the best announcer in the game right now and we should be thankful when we get him instead of ian eagle for the 12th time in a row lol
i think its interesting that an overwhelming majority clicked the top fuck the steelers option i guess its embedded in our minds that surveys list yes before no
i love listening to romo call a game not since john madden has there been someone as enthusiastic and familiar with the intricacies of the game
romo is great and if he doesnt think lamar is perfect than he probably agrees with 99 of this entire sub lamar is great but still has a lot of areas of improvement

gonna get an illegal formation penalty at least once in the game its basically a certainty at this point
dont hold your breath the referee crew today is tied for 2nd most penalties called in the league

every week this season i will be doing a crappy photoshop for our matchup here are the past weeks submissions

week 1 don lamar

week 2 the texans chainsaw massacre

week 3 over the top

week 4 he got game

week 5 gladiator

week 6 eagle eye

week 7 byecentennial man

week 8 no country for old ben

week 9 a rivers runs through it

week 10 patriot games
there it is awesome harbs as the princess got me good props to you really feels like its gonna be this kind of game too going up against henry without calais and williams hope this gets lots of eyes on it
oh i missed the elaborate memes in here

im hoping madubuike and broderick washington step up
theyre also in danger missing a lot of their offensive line may be a nasty game with a bunch of short gains for him we just need to stop the chains from moving constantly and be ready for the quick slant to aj or deep across the middle to the tight end
somehow the ravens are still favored by 6 the only hope i have for this game is that vegas knows something we dont
heard titans are missing quite a few key players too well see how it goes
i think we sell out to stop the run which is going to put a lot of pressure on our secondary
skybet have henry 100 rushing yards lamar 50 rushing yards at 51 seems like a no brainer to me
something is telling me judon is gonna have a great game today
its gonna be an ugly 2 weeks
this is the game we figure out who we are and arent
understatement of the day
halftime now we are doing better than i expected if we keep henry to 3 yards or less on 1st down we can pull this off
edit final now
good call
just proved right
not the worst still would like them though
this team is a joke
chuck actually did good
henry is going to set records
defeatist smh
my expectations are low for sure this week which means the ravens are right where they wanna be for a super bowl run
i went to work im not gonna watched it
wherever it is set it is still too high derrick henry for 700 yds lol
im just happy henry is on my fantasy team today i hope we win by 3 and henry breaks the single game rushing record
im excited about having deshon back there to tackle this week he hits hard and tackles well i predict hell have a very good game and hell fare much better against henry than earl thomas did last year
earl who
earl was henrys best blocker that game lmao
i understand elliot may have more fire but earl thomas is still a better player than elliot hes a step or 2 behind reaction wise
heres to hoping
he hits hard but he takes bad angles at the los which is where we need to hit henry but well see
cant remember what game but elliot was getting penalties and just giving up view of him hasnt been great since the twitter comments though
deshon gave it to henry
good point hopefully patrick queen can step up too but he did not look good at all last week
occasionally i cant get the ravens games because even though i live in md im closer to dc so it defaults to the silly washington team i have cbs all access but still concerned it will only show that local game of wtf vs bungles will it show anyone else in the same boat figure out a solution aside from a stream thanks
itll be the wft game when i lived in rockville i used a real powerful hd antenna and could get wjz regularly
my cbs this week has 2 options one for the redskins and one for the ravens i suspect this may be the same for you
its possible itll only be wft on your end

but you could always stream the ravens game online if you really want to watch it
same issue i am having i live in somd and am wondering if cbs all access will allow me to stream the ravens game since im technically in area just hoping it gives me the option and not force me to watch wft
fyi if u need to watch just 1 week nfl sunday ticket does a oneweek free trial just cancel after the game
mfs a bird so he can fly fast
forgot poe was the mascot for a second and thought you meant dontari poe
the simpsons already did it
poetry in motion
he does have a good wingspan
its not the receivers completelylamar has work to do
removed


haha i bought one similar last year no one got the joke
real question what happened to gordon after last year any reason we never publicly looked into bringing him in
hes with the seahawks
because hes suspended and is currently signed to the seahawks
because hes been suspended like 7 times in his career its cool that he was talented a few years ago but that many suspensions isnt a fluke its a trend unfortunately

also he plays for seattle lmao
revenge game incoming lets go
wheres the beer
anyone else have a better gut feeling about this game than last week
luke wilson gunna get a short redzone pass for a td
our defense and special teams are fucking awful i fully expect ravens to score on the first possession

tony banks was so electric when he took over that offense its a shame that he fell off a bit the next year
if you missed it please google stopped the show down im not crying you are crying
for anyone else who missed it and had trouble with the google


all 5 of the hosts on nfl countdown were tearing up afterwardstoo moving
why am i crying up in this club rn
ngl im still chocked up
not a ravens fan but i just ugly cried the entire segment thought i was good and then started up again a moment later that kid is incredible may his legacy live on to inspire us all
bro i just showed my parents and we all lost it most ive cried in a while
espn often gets shit on in this sub which is rough for me since i work there but they did an amazing job with this piece for sure
oh mo
i didnt realize i was going to cry today but here we are haha mo gaba gets me everytime
nfl network teased a piece on him for their thanksgiving show
welp im weeping like a baby

jesus christ his mother is one hell of a strong person i dont think id be able to talk to anyone if i lost my daughter
hearing his unfettered laughter right at the beginning just crushed my heart

god i miss that laugh
stop cutting onions
we all know his story but it still hits like a ton of bricks

rip
dude im fucking bawling
mom i cant do it anymore

i feel so bad for mos mom
rip
im a steelers fan and this piece had me bawling it was so touching and i hate you guys but really applaud the gold mo in the end zone

yeah they announced purple maybe someone finally tore whoever was picking the colours a new one black on black would be so great
i remember last year during the pats game they were calling on all fans for a blackout yet they still wore white pants extremely disappointing got the w tho
what is the yellow outline on the numbers though
i think its black just saw tucker in black doing warmups
i think its blackwhite
black

sam koch about to go off on thursday
nfl does not care anymore browns have a positive test every week only that player goes to the list we had the same with humphrey too
ill delete if this is too controversial but this definitely caught my eye especially with how mum the ravens have been about trace and the nfls closecontact rule
this doesnt necessarily mean close contact though i believe the rule is 15 minutes or more without wearing a mask so it is possible none of the qbs are determined close contacts or all of the qbs are considered close contacts also mcsorely doesnt necessarily have covid he may have just been exposed to someone with covid so i guess we shall see


thanks for the picture

honestly you have a great wife
hey welcome to old age ive been old for a few months now
hopefully this means queen is going to ball out today also happy birthday
caribbean queen
now were sharing the same dream
and our hearts they beat as one
no more love on the run

god damn aged like milk
the funny thing is that 11222009 was the date of the ravenscolts game a game in which the ravens lost 1715 billy cundiff made 5 field goals that day but he also missed a costly 30yarder in the 3rd quarter

so the question is how truly thankful were you for cundiff at the time i get that this status was either posted before the game or after one of his successful attempts in the first half but man only if you knew what was about to happen

edit ive just put twoandtwo together and realized cundiffs career in baltimore started and ended with him missing a crucial 30something yard field goal in his first and last games as a raven whoa thats kind of interesting albeit in a notsopleasantforus way
look at it this way if we hadnt gotten tucker we might not won the sb the next year
oof
pain

the cardinals ran a fake zone read against the seahawks that i think would fit in nicely with the ravens offense

x200b



x200b

1 from the shot gun the qb and running back show a zone read look until they get to the mesh point
2 once they get to the mesh point instead of the running back continuing across the qbs face and carrying out the fake the running back pivots in the opposite direction and becomes a lead blocker for the qb

this would probably be effective against defenses relying on the scrape exchange to defend the zone read because the playside defensive end will take themselves out of position trying to cut off the zone run especially if they arent one of the extremely athletic ones and the running back can then block the scraping middle line backer
greg roman and innovation two things that will never exist
we tried something like that i believe it was last week and jk dobbins messed up the fake the ravens did a dummy zone read into a qb option look with jk ass the pitch man just didnt work out but also a play ive seen the cards run
they need to take the whole playbook this pro style option attack only worked with 3 tight end sets being a major factor the loss of hurst hurt more than what the coaching staff predicted the team has to go to a spread attack to be successful moving forward without nick boyle the oc cant keep pretending like its possible to run the same style of offense

time for queen and harrison to put the grown man pants on and get ready to catch a rhino in the chest
fucked up the post format but the content is yikes

i feel like today is the day ravens faithful fall in love with madboogie madabuike lets get it


washington is my least favorite team because they take priority in local games i hate them and wish them nothing but failure if they air on cbs
i live in vegas and am somehow getting the game super thrilled about that guessing its a regional thing keeping you from getting it if thats in md welp thats some bad football to replace this game with
where do you live
its such bs im in nova and this shit always happens every year fuck the skins
how we streaming
you must live in the dmv and not in the true baltimore primary market
its on cbs for me eastern shore md
well at least in aaco cbs is the ravens game

how badly theyre doing jesus christ lol
yanda
defense hurt no stop run good

offense loses 23 tight ends no true 1 wr still injuries hof guard retired lamars passing isnt as bad as everyone says but its definitely not as efficient as it was last year but again having no actual targets will do that lol

were 63 were not a bad team we just got spoiled by last seasons electrifying performances
injuries

no yanda

hollywood is a bust

roman is trash and his play calls consistently suck

we dont use our actual food players enough jk gus snead duvernay

injuries
coaching

but why white pants
seems fitting as we wore them in the playoff matchup against them

after seeing that bullshit pregame from the titans can i say fuck the titans is that in poor taste because fuck the titans
fuck the titans and their fans do i want to see people get hurt never its just a game

seriously though fuck the titans
this
we lost ggs
lol yeah like these injuries are all freak occurrences not one team headhunting the other


went to your profile in hopes of pics of your guitar collection now im bummed
co checking in the rocky mountain flock is strong out here
dutch flock was present though without the maryland undies
hell yeah same here cali brother

fuck off lamar has taken that hit 20 times this season
why have souljas who cant catch
dobbins has that same fire lamar has
i like how lamar said this was not a revenge game then the titans come out and act like the ravens have been dissing their moms all season
all these soulja not using their hands
dobbins big gain doesnt touch ball again on the drive makes sense
theyve missed 2 obvious tn holds
reup bowser give him as many princesses as he wants
gosh im such a slut for a good defensive series
friendship with hollywood ended

andrews is my new soulja now
henry not as good without earl thomas lead blocking for him
no matter what henry got shut the fuck down today without calais martindale is a tank
lamar scrambles for 12 seconds and not a single wr gets any kind of seperation
i love ingram but hes not rb1 material at the moment
the titans have 2 good seasons and think they can go back to 2000 trash talking everybody
harbaugh needs to print out hollywoods dumbass tweet on 100 cards and give them to him every time he doesnt play like a soulja
dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins dobbins
dez talks shit after every catch love it
is it just me or did duverney play that really bad
got to give that defense big credit theyre holding it down against henry no room whatsoever
vrabel put your big ass nose in your mask
fuck the titans already why you screaming at us from midfield
damn malik harrison just tackled henry while being blocked what a g
jk is averaging 83 yards per carry and jackson is 28

i dont know about you but i think the decision is obvious
cant hit them high cant hit them low
ever since harbaugh yelled at that ref without a mask weve been getting bs call after bs call
fix your fucking stupid rtp penalties

that was clean as hell just a half second late fucking bullshit
this team gets fucked harder on penalties than anyone else
he was a yard past the marker wtf is that spot
what a terrible finish fgs dont get it done
ngl i like seeing these scuffles it shows the ravens are actually engaged and tryna win you can tell when they space out and arent focused so far that hasnt really happened

roman however continues to fuck us over
talk yo shit dobby
my disdain for the titans has increased tremendously because of what they did before the game fuck em
hollywood looking like a bust rn man
best power back in the league and you dont give it to him on 3rd and 2
good challenge harbs
that holding penalty didnt take long
id like to take this time to point out how we are the 5th most penaltied team and we have the second least amount of flags for us
i really hope dez gets more than one target in the second half
meanwhile joe burrow just got carted off looked like a brutal left knee injury prayers up
titans taking play like a raven to heart lol
good challenge bullshit call by refs
every game feels like ravens vs refs
lol that drive was a microcosm of all our problems on o

gus and jk chunkin yards then get ignored

hollywood the butterhand soulja

lamar floating balls

darkness

imprisoning me
we just cant blame our offensive woes on one person or one thing there are so many things going on

1 really bad injuries to key players stanley boyle and ingram most notably
2 roman is just not calling plays to this teams strengths tough to watch sometimes
3 our receivers are inconsistent
4 our oline is inexperienced
5 lamar isnt seeing the field like he did last year which is probably a result of the aforementioned points

fortunately none of this is impossible to overcome except for maybe the injuriesbut every team is struggling with injuries we can improve
that is a horrible fucking call fuck the god damn refs
i expect a penalty whenever we get a stop on defense and whenever we do something good on offense at this point
how did we lose to the pats
i watch other teams and their wrs make all these great plays since sssr playoff boldin and the late stage derrick mason this team has spent 20 years looking for a young elite wr
we need to draft only oline and wr this draft
im just happy we held them to 3
good challenge
apparently titans were doing their pregame speech on our center field logo and harbaugh got into it with malcom butler seriously fuck this team hope we kick the shit out of them
so sick of this rb by committee just run dobbins and use gus on third downs and ingram on passing plays
we literally have to play the refs every week
bullshit ass call man come tf on thats a textbook fuckin tackle
the titans are failing all the way down the field how is this even happening
titans about to score off of 2 bad calls then again that has been happening most of the games this year
that was a roman call lmao new center lets run a wildcat play lmao
what a snap by skura yesss
did anyone else hear tony romo say well they have skrua and then say oops other team
jesus christ im still so hype about that kill shot from elliot to henry thats the kind of hit that makes people not be so afraid of you anymore
nah man duvernay did a shitty job of spotting that ball shouldve been his
ryan lamar tannehill jackson
lamar makes a throw like that and everyone crucifies him

starting wr make that catch
would love an 8 minute scoring drive right here
good challenge
lmao refs doing everything to make sure we dont get a conversion
its fine tucker 70 yard field goal incoming
remember when greg roman said he was going to change up play calling this week

pepperidge farms remembers
these titans player talking to much man
can romo get vrabels dick out of his mouth
what is romo fucking talking about
at least our defense is playing good again
alright guys im at work and my wifi is terrible so im going to have to live bicuriously through you guys
deshon elliot is cam chancellor in the free safety spot

i thought we were getting a ball hawk

he just head butted dez in the fucking helmet and no cal
wolfe is fucking balling today damn
this is why we need a legit number 1 wr you think dhop doesnt make that catch thats what they are there for to bail out average throws
obviously a 1st down
remember when the refs moved the patriots ball forward past the first down even though they were short
stop letting tannehill get easy ass yards on every rollout
please lamar please just get it done end the narrative get some revenge for last year show us this team actually has something about it its on you
chuck clark marcus peters and marlon humphrey just gave up the ugliest td a wr has had on us all year
i cant wait for the post about how everything is just fucking dandy and the people not happy about losing games are fake fans
this one is unforgivable you cant give up an 11 point lead in the 4th quarter against a team that cant defend on third down and just move on to next week without acknowledging something drastic needs to change with this team

greg roman needs to go hollywood brown needs to make catches if he wants to run his mouth on social media the defense needs to tackle and when those things breakdown which they often do lamar jackson needs to step up and be a winning quarterback the way ryan tannehill just did so far he hasnt

if the ravens dont have a sizable lead they lose they cant play from behind they cant overcome deficits they cant hold midgame marginal leads its pathetic
that was a great throw by lamar some soulja lol
not even a second in the pocket id love to see any other qb thrive in that situation
they dont wanna talk about how that mf just tackled 2 people
dez definitely was open
if theyre gonna call that bullshit might as well tell your players to hit him as hard as possible
dude we have caught the most bullshit fouls in the last 3 games i swear
how the fuck is that roughing the passer in a situation after a 3rd down stop worst professional sport for officiating and its not even close
roughing the passer lmfaooo
89 is our soulja
they learned from greg roman the best
try that fucking wildcat again trash
refs constantly trying to fuck us over sick of it
wtf dude i hate bitching about refs but thats just fucking ridiculous
we need to start bullying refs till they quit or get better at their fucking job
they really fucked us with that spot on the last drive
to yall saying why didnt lamar look at dez way for a jump ball why in the fuck would he risk a jump ball it was obvious throw it wide open or throw it away for the fg
judon with the 15 yard penalty on the coin toss probably
cant complain about a penalty that just needs to be a better throw
decent drive receivers still dogshit
jk has a right to be pissed
jk is gashing them so lets take him out and try to get cute
yannick is hungry todya
imagine running wildcat on a crucial play and losing momentum because of a bad snap ravens would never
burrow getting carted off with that gruesome injury after all of the other qb injuries should make us grateful that lamar is healthy right now and to not take that for granted
time to drain the clock let lamar run it hand it to jk and gus eat the remainder of the fourth quarter and force them to go 80 yards in 40 seconds
yea thats a first
stands fuck yourself refs what
this shouldnt have ever come to this because lamar got the first
dont worry first round sensation hollywood brown will save the day hes unstoppable
this is on mekari

dude picked the worst fucking time for a brainfart
harrison has quietly been playing great football the last two weeks
roman is ruining lamar with shit plays
the fucking rookie is fuming at you roman get fucked man
wow 3rd and 7 and no penalty to give them the first down w
yannick haters thats the kind of play that doesnt show up on the stat sheet forced pressure to an incomplete on 3rd down
dobby is finally a free elf god dammit yes
that was a thigh shot fuck this shit dude
typical ref job
they should just rename roughing the passer to touching the quarterback
refs have seemed really biased against us this year
i loved romo last year but his disdain for the ravens is ridiculous i am fucking sick of his bullshit
theyre really trying to turn this sport into a noncontact nightmare
yannick first official sack for us but hes been a force since hes got here
something has to be broken there didnt see it but damn
fuck the titans but hope hes ok
tits calling powers dirty is ridiculoushelmet hit him on the hip
skura playing for the titans
haha fucking sucks doesnt it
dropped passes injuries and drives ruined by bad snaps you can tell the titans have been watching ravens film
fuck the titans

fuck mike vrabel

fuck derrick henry

lmaooooo
ravens positivity is back on the menu
the titans franchise is such trash
why is that not a penalty on the guy hitting dez in the helmet after the play thats a penalty on us every time
duvernay fucking quit on that play wtf
derek wolfe has been amazing
we should not be allowed to draft anyone shorter than 63 this year
elliot reminds me of dawkins with his huge hits and how fucking juiced he is lol
we need a 10 minute scoring drive here cant put the ball back in derrick henrys hands
our best receiver willie snead
eagles are useless jags are useless

we need this win fuck the titans
we should simply microchip the football and use technology to get the spot right every time
lamar kills way too many drives with awful off target throws
after going up 11 at the beginning of the 3rd quarter the ravens have run two rb rushes
damn that fs penalty stopped us
lamar came back and tied the game thats growth i want tobwin this game but even if we dont we are seeing a ravens team that is growing
if greg roman doesnt catch the game winning touchdown i want him gone
they should be ashamed letting a team come in and dance on your midfield letting them talk shit and hit you in the mouth they disrespect that shield when they play like that the same shield ray lewis and ed reed built up shame on them

embarrassing
can marcus peters learn to fucking tackle by the way
its telling that i have way more confidence that theyll manage to lose a close game than win one dramatic difference from last season
this team is so soft the titans come out talking shit on our logo and then drive right down the field they have no respect for us and we arent giving them any reason to
fuck the steelers

fuck the titans

fuck the browns

fuck the refs

fuck indianapolis

and fuck the white pants

can we get the purple or black pants back please
yo wtf was that titan punching our guy at the end there
dez caught it
dez caught it

thats how i do it right
the fact it looks like nothing is changing week to week is a seriously fucking issue our coaches are looking overrated af
i dont want to hear anymore shit from 15 until he can do his job
every ingram handoff feels like a wasted play tbh
fantastic play by harrison making the tackle while blocked lol
out of everyone this sub has turned on queen is the only one i wont understand first year and hes been solid for like 90 of his snaps
dobbins has a huge run pass the ball twice
delay of game and an opi missed lmao
honestly dobbins is our best rb by far
another bs penalty that was not a low blow at all all the way above the knees what a crock of shit
you cant hit in the stomach anymore
roughing the passer has been ruined since they modified the rules tampa a week ago got flagged for roughing on a sack its ridiculous
always gotta give the opponent help in an offensive league fucking bullshit
refs are biased and you cant tell me otherwise
yannick showing up today
okay so we literally didnt even want to score literally a titans player got injured because we decided to run plays without attempting to score rather than just take it to half kinda of awful actually
imma be honest yall im getting to a point where im getting sick and tired of our playcalls
that pats game was the definition of a trap game with weather injuries center fucking up and all
stunt on these hoes lamar
lamar threw him open
classic lamar finally
now thats a soulja
ok so elliot is better than earl in tackling derrick henry lol
deshon elliott is killing people out here
opponents olines are immune from holding calls
the ghost of skura strikes again
same play as last year different result
about time another team fucked up on a snap
simmons needs to calm his ass down making contact with every raven he can
well pretend thats a punt smh
henry is absolutely getting stopped good job d he was the concern and hes been eliminated so far
could have eaten the clock to make it 2 score game but no we had to throw it deep
ryan clark was 100 right henry doesnt truck big dudes just little dbs hes too tall
looked at the thread and thought we were losing checked the score and were winning even with all the injuries why is everyone so upset
why dont we get any holding calls
big stop for real
feed dobby please
why in earth did they not go for it on 4th with henry who for this drive looks good got away with one there
gro calling red zone plays for them
looked like a really shitty spot
thats first it shouldnt even had to have been challenged
they need to launch some sort of inquiry into this bullshit
yo this game is seriously fixed
derek wolfe is an absolute beast
why do we have to deal with this bs every fucking week i know we arent the only team that gets unlucky with calls but we are definitely up there with the amouny of bad calls we get per game
ive never seen our defense play this soft and heartless baltimore is viewed as one of the best tackling teams every year and today our tackling or lack there of is killing us even if we squeak into the playoffs were getting blown out first round playing like this
snead just have me a fucking heart attack
good recovery by snead
mekari stopped us from winning the game there
if the center didnt fuck up hollywood wouldve had the game winner these penalties are killing us
best chance is a missed fg at this point
i hate the fact that this loss puts us below the browns in the standings
when did this sub turn on patrick queen all of a sudden hes not great yet but hes been one of the best defensive rookies he had zero preseason and is still learning
literally our defence leaves a guy wide open on every play and refs only call holds one way every week
shoutouts to greg roman and our new identity
that was a good playcall tho
pi only on us per usual life as a ravens fan
lol titans get all the break against the ravens that lb had no clue where the ball was and it hits him on the hand
grab henry by the turd and throw his ass down
better hands than the soulja
pay bowser let judon walk
anybody who says roman doesnt deserve to get fired after that drive is blind
imagine taking out jk what a fucking joke
dobbins 2 big runs

gro ok thats enough lets pass now dobbins go to the bench
defense looks good offense sub par

ravens football is back baby
run defense looks soooo much better this week luckily one of our coordinators knows how to adjust
tony clearly watches our games judon did well to not hit him in the helmet lmao
i have zero doubt about lamars passing ability just develop those receivers and develop better plays
start dobbins
that wasnt roughing wtf refs

he was already in motion
what a fucking joke of a penalty
cant go low cant go high cant do fucking shit
im sorry thats a call that we dont get when we are on offense
romo sounding like an idiot on that he hit him right in the dick thats not low
im trained on 3rd down stops not to get excited i always look for the flag
soft ass call we get like 2 calls in our favor a season
romo makes me uncomfortable
this drive by the titans is unbelievable in every feasible way
ngakoue already has that play like a raven mentality
yannick is bringing pressure every single play major props to edc for acquiring him
yannick showing his explosiveness now will we now start to reap the dividends
yannick is killing today
ngakoue been reading you niggas comments and hes very upset now
yannick hopefully keeps winning vs sambraillo usually if a rusher starts to dominate it doesnt get better for the tackle the longer it goes on
clipping
some of these us comedies look god awful do people genuinely like these shows
this is the first ravens game where yannick has looked like a game wrecker
for the most part a good half by the offense and defense defense held it down when they needed to have contained derrick henry the offense has been moving the ball
i refuse to believe greg roman is calling plays
i took a piss and missed the fuckin touchdown lol
that was andrews jackson chemistry like a 20 bill
that is literally the play we ran last week that skura botched lmao
lol what kind of trickery was that

bah god thats greg romans music
mfw the titans center says he has a cut on his thumb
they really tried to hit us with ptsd smh
titans fans calling to injure lamar haha pathetic
titans fans are the best
ol reliable willie snead
yeah he got it
another awful spot
this team makes me so fucking angry
ever since harbaugh yelled at that ref we are called on every soft penalty
watching steelers highlights his passes are the same or worse than lamars his receivers just adjust and make ridiculous plays
hate to be negative but this has all the makings of a classic ravens loss
calling him humphries triggers me
all hollywood has done since complaining about targets is drop passes smh
it gets clearer every week how dobbins is the best rb on the roster
lamar seems like hes making some decent passes that drop by brown woulda been a great play
i still have faith in this team but the 2019 season made me forget how it felt to watch a real ravens game
i dont hate them more than the steelers but the titans are up there
big play there by harrison good for the rookie
and a little crow for the queen haters
where are all of you cry babies at
but queen sucks according to this sub cause pff said so
some dude said sorry ryan your wr is in another castle lmaooo
put respect on his name now

hes rookie ffs
dez 1 on 1 is why you brought him in for hello
jk running at 8 yards a clip back to bench ive got a sweep lined up for our power running back gtfo with this nonsense
just fire greg roman man

why dont you just run the damn ball with dobbins
wtf man at some point we have to start questioning harbs for allowing the same shit week after week
greg roman took dobbins out to make gus edwards look like a jackass
absolutely no one


roman lets take out the guys whos been running constantly and giving us yards


fuck roman
defense has woken up offense can you do anything
i want a fucking touchdown
dobbins keeps glaring at the sideline like mother fucker do not pull me out haha
dez has been open on several playsjust sayin
yo somebody call roman and tell him to just let dobbins eat
the previous play is under review
this game cements the dobbins is the rb1
note to dobbins

be rice but dont be rice

if you catch my drift
dobbins is our future and its not even funny build around him like the vikings did with cook
greg roman is like 27 never heard of him lets give him a whirl
dobby is a free elf
i would be bawling lol that looked like it hurt so much
hes diving at him while hes throwing what do they want him to do
how is he supposed to pull up full sprint gtfo
yannick making his presence known
ngakoue just needed some time to adjust to our d hopefully he eats from here on out
ravens 14 tenesee 7 refs 3
titans enjoy the three points from the refs
oh my goodness shut the hell up about that damn review it was like 15 plays ago
now dobbins getting in it with the titans defender

bruh i love dobbins energy today
playing calling was trash there
1 timeout with 50 seconds to go and play it safe you have got to be kidding me
71 yards in penalties in a single half lol
now thats a muthafucking play right there roman is living up to his comments this week
lamar jackson cant throw
beleedat
lamar cant throw outside
skura is doing alright just blocking i think we should keep mekari starting going forward he did really well at the end of last season also
where is everyone from an hour ago saying season is over were gonna go 88

jk all love fam
destroy the tits
elliot just fucking killed a man
sit down henry that aint earl
holding them to a fg would be a massive w
71 got held so badly call a fucking hold on them refs
looked like a skura snap
lets get a dez td on this drive
wow having center issues really hinders your ability to score points
and this is how dez bryant gets snaps our wrs are not very good we cant ask for much of them
that was on duvernay gave up on the route
dez is having a better game then hollywood and he hasnt played in years lmao
defense has really stepped up love the play of fort queen wolfe today
the hit on henry is looking like its affecting him a lot big statement hit for the rest of the game though
damn i thought our injuries were bad
that deep pass was the most idiotic thing we could have possibly done
henry is gouging ya and they pass thats some roman level playcalling
big stop
we have to score a td
wow surprised they went for a fg there
we need a scoring drive now
that was a first down on replay worth a challenge imo
wtf i thought he had the 1st down too
you have nothing to lose with this challenge
man i love the ravens but fuck this season
lets go win a fucking game fuck

joseph vincent flacco
i want us to go ahead and drive for the win

but i know we wont
anyone remember when it was like 2113
those routes were sad as fuck lol
wow our wrs really are that bad
regardless of the outcome that was a clutch drive by lamar showing development
bout to put hollywood on a milk carton yo


where is this man
good job peters keep getting beat all game
the offense in this game was specifically greg romans adjustments to be better it looked exactly the same boot him
this about to be a bad day for us
this team looks like its given up bunch of fucking pussies since they got upset in the divisional round

wish we had a suggs personality need some nastiness with the talent
the most tight ends by all tight ends jim nantz
somebody needs to be cam camerond team playing with zero grit like wtf
why cant we have a wideopen reciever also
defense is cooked until we get cambell and williams back greg roman better put his money where his mouth with after his comments of fixing this offense because they have to win it
dobbins is so clearly better than ingram yet doesnt get a lot more carries
incompletion but i like the play concept sliding max protection
defenders beat our receivers on every contested catch
lamar had him fire that bitch in there cmon dude
hollywood should be named puxatney phil cause hes afraid of his own shadow
sigh bowser to a 3 year extension right meowwwwww
lets goo fuck the titans and there dirty ass team
patrick lightning queen
excellent blitz forcing a bad decision by qb time for a td
someone just called queen a bust like 2 plays ago lol
ridiculous dobbins converts 2 firsts and roman sits him to call garbage ass plays that our o cant execute
what the fuck are these calls fucks sake
1st and goal and you call some random bs play that your players dont even know how to run right sounds bout roman
greg roman has got to go wtf
say what you want about our receivers but mark andrews is legitimately a top 34 te and even he hasnt been great this year


its the fuckin coordinator get roman the fuck out of here
i just cant understand why dobbins isnt getting most carries the man has burst and is our best runner by far are our coaches just blind or we refuse to change the game plan either way is bad
pleasantly surprised at the henry containment so far yea hes getting yards but hes not trampling us as much as expected

our offense needs to step tf up asap cuz were gonna lose this game if we cant score on these drives romanjust give it to dobbins we couldve had a td and been ahead
starting to feel like a classic ravens game defense carries and we can only score on fgs
omfg if we dont feed dobbins all game
mandrews is wr1
dont take dobbins out for the rest of the game
friendship with ingram ended jk is my best friend now
fuck the titans
all jokes aside though our offense isnt a well oiled machine like it was last year the running back by committee shit isnt working its time to let jk be the feature back
the fuck is he supposed to do tickle the qb till he drops the ball
bullshit call as usual ravens always have one of those
im disgusted with that call
thats fucking soft hit at the waist was falling down happened as he was throwing

soft as fuck
bullshit calllll
that wasnt a stupid penalty that was absolute garbage this team is undisciplined at times but that wasnt it
this year has been really frustrating with penalties
jesus christ just hold them to a fg here this drive is making me open the whiskey
thanks for giving the titans a free first down
only thing titans receivers can catch is covid
that penalty is going to let the titans run down the clock score right before halftime and then they get the ball to start the 3rd that penalty is going to destroy all of our momentum
stopped them twice on that drive too
doing a much better job on henry this year knock on wood
god damn yannick is beasting
wow wow wow

yannick not only forced the throw but stopped his momentum just to be safe great play
great job d holding them to 3 after all the adversity on that drive is huge keep hitting henry hard
yannick showing up big time
yannick may not get the sack but the pressure has been consistent that makes a huge difference
i hate seeing guys down writhing in pain like that crap
fuck dude that made me nauseous poor guy
listen to those cardboard cutouts booing
damn that shit was nasty hope he recovers quickly damn that sucks
titans sub think powers did that on purpose lol
not passing here is very not harbaugh
lmao judon said fuck it
defense is looking really patient in a good way not being over aggressive getting into the backfield and letting short passes and screens turn into big plays
thank god we played the chiefs early in the season and have since adjusted to the screen pass
dobbins is literally ray rice and ray rice is the most explosive player we have ever had
dobbins is lowkey the best player on our offense right now
i swear if lamar just gets a little more consistent with his deep throwing idk how you stop him
earl thomas could never
this might be a lil irrelevant to us but prayers up to burrow he seems like a genuine guy and its a shame to see him go like this
is that how you get out of having to go into concussion protocol just grab a different body part
lol skuraed
lmao fuck you vrabel you fuck
lol did we trade skura
you have a new center and you put the halfback alone in the backfield insanity
skuras probably on the sideline laughing rn
woohoo a center mishap without skura
everyone shitting on skura and i get it but he was pretty good before he got the cut on his thumb wasnt he i expect him to be back to snapping once that is 100
hit them with another deep shot lj
mom can we have bill belichick

we have bill belichick at home

bill belichick at home mike vrabel
yo fuck dean pees
lets fucking get it dez
run defense steps up then our pass def shits the bed
alright offense we need this rn
offense really has to step up and put at least 3 on the board
defense really showing up in the red zone
henry is having a great drive and you dont run it on 3 and 4 and short near the goal line what
endless handoffs to dobbins then fg at best they get the ball back with 1 minute remaining
the ravens are a bad football team this season and its long past time to admit that
we look so different from last year

no fucking swagger or heart where the fuck is big trussss and stuntin on teams

this team looks fucking defeated and i hate it
lets win that coin toss and feed dobbins
i just cant believe these fucking play calls its insane
tucker is the only consistent thing on this team
refs swallow the whistle when its our receivers being held
cant wait to see the wonderful penalties we can get next drive to ruin literally everything
its okay guys wait till week 17 to complain about problems that have been here all season if you even give a ounce of criticism i will call you a fair weather fan
3 out then let them walk in a td this game is going be over by halftime
2 weeks in a row lamar throws a 5050 ball to our wrs 2 times the opposing team got an interception
hate their fucking country music loving city franchise so much
just feels like the team all of a sudden plays with zero heart
blitz on 3rd and long first down

blitz on 3rd and long first down

blitz on 3rd and long first down

blitz on 3rd and long first down

blitz on 3rd and long first down
souljas
he is marquise until he can actually catch
dobbins looking good
look i love ingram big truss all that

why in the sweet tender fuck are we not using dobbins at all
should just try pulling henry down by his dread nothing else works
pay bowser with judon money lol
fuck the titans fuck em
thats ravens d right there
hated that playcalling
this offense is so bad and its because of coaching play calling and taking jk out killed that drive coaching has been lackluster
deep in the redzone time for a fucking field goal

flacco era vibes
some of the shittiest sequence of plays ive ever seen
why the fuck do you take jk out
fire greg roman literally right now and let lamar call the fucking plays
running it down their throats isnt good enough for roman

dude is lost get him out of here
dobbins is doing great lets pass three plays in a row
they really tryna jinx tucker
i cant believe this is what we gave our franchise qb this season only team in the nfl that routinely fails to surround their franchise qb with great weapons even back in the flacco era
dez would have had that td
jeez did jk fuck romans wife or something give the hot hand the ball what the fuck
ravens have not had a standout wr since steve smith sr
roman dobbins 2 runs with 5 yards yeah lets take him out and try some garbage passes


wtf he fucking needs to go
why the hell was dobbins sent to the bench never to return when he was the only one keeping the sticks moving on that drive
so dobbins fucked romans wife or took a shit in his cereal our rb rotation feels like the opposite of riding the hot hand
justice hill finally found his role on the team as a st ace
henry missing earl thomas on lead block
again how do you line up dez on the outside 1 on 1 and dont tell lamar to take that shit 100
fuck the titans man theyre trying to be relevant by acting like tough guys
fucking finally man now score with dobbins
how many times does dobbins have to prove himself keep him in
dobbins and edwards need to be the rb tandem i love you ingram but your wheels arent what they were
this would be a blowout if roman ran it in with dobbins
should be a td worst case scenario its 1st and goal on the 1 inch line
dobbins is a beast especially considering the banged up oline hes playing behind
its clearly a td refs out here demanding recounts like the titans check just cashed in
dobbins player of the game so far
anyone loving dez hype the boys up love the addition
queen is good his face got rustled we good yall
me in the spring who needs claypool hes a worse version of boykin who might have to go the waller route i like boykin in a second year
this team gets fucked by tricks every week lol
wasnt that right at the waist and right at the release call seems weak to me
weak call
we have to be leading the league in penalty yards right
soft ass call fuck these refs
receivers named brown and dropping the ball name a better duo
fucking hate the titans so much

i feel like we stopped them 5 times on this drive alone
i really try hard not to be a homer about bad calls but fuck man that was a squeaky clean hit
this drive is like what i would imagine being fucked in the ass without lube would feel like
as it stands there is no means for the league to hold officials accountable for bad calls until this changes its only going to get worse
how many times were the titans bailed out on this drive and they still didnt score lmao
this fucker has sucked all year and of course nails that fg
fuck the tits
ok hail mary to dobbins ez
that is why we got yannick yall dude is just abusing the left tackle
why do the networks act like we care if they have a double header on their network
damn hes in some pain hope hes ok
jk is fired up today
we should be blowing the tits out right now if our red zone offense was even a shell of last years
romo been shit all game how do you not know the holy roller
48 sec with a time out and we dont even try to get into fg range
lamar shoving dobbins back in the huddle as hes jawin with the titans lol
refs have a permanent residence in baltimores stadium in the away team locker room
im not even envious about the steelers dusty 6 super bowl wins im envious about their constantly great wr core
i dont usually care but that was an especially bad halftime report right they talked more about roethlisberger and deshaun than the game were watching
wink is a great coachstrategist ill be sad when he leaves for a hc job
that was a bad ass spin dobbins
jackson is so good when the line plays well
where are the people who said lamar cant throw deep and outside the number i wanna talk to them
my god what a strike lamar
yeaaaaaaaa boiiiiiiii
yelling at the tv time lets goooooooo
no way roman is calling these plays
refs pulling out the flag machine for the titans drive
pretty sure that was outside the numbers
now mandrews got a td i want to see dez catch one before this game is over
shout out to that guy intentionally not watching the game apparently thats all we needed
burrows being carted off and hes clutching his knee damn that sucks
deshon punked henry
i dont get what peters was doing after he caught up to davis there lazy
the only thing i wanted to see today was derrick henry get smacked im glad hes not hurt but that was fucking awesome
fucking romo doesnt know how to pronounce the names of anyone on our team
lmfaoooo roman switched teams at ht
how does it feel bitch
why the fuck do refs not call holds for us these should be drive killing penalties and its never called
titans fans baltimore has some snap issues

titans center hold my milk
time is a flat circle
that just felt so good
ok boys lets go seal the deal
elliot smacked the dog outta henry lmaooo
the league owes the ravens an apology for that missed hold call on 71 i cannot get over how bad of a missed call that was teams we play never get called for offensive holding
did they not watch us botch the same play last week lmao
whats soulja today 04
we replaced hollywood with dez
awful route by duvernay
dez aint taking any shit i love it
it was a couple of plays ago but man i was so excited to see james proche get involved in the offense and grab his first nfl catch
that one was on duvernay
that int was on duvernay not lamar he stopped in his route and misjudged the distance rookie mistake
this offense is a complete mystery they can look top 5 one drive and then the next looks like they arent a nfl offense
we need a turnover right now god i wish i was at the bank caz i know theyd be playing enter sandman right now and the crowd would be fired up
cant let the d get worn out
if we lose ill never forgive them for costing us the opportunity to post that lamar chip and pregame scuffle an entire week
why does our bench have to wear masks but theirs doesnt
ive seen torrey smith and qadry ismail blame duvernay for that int

oh well defense is gonna have to hold them here damn man
td ends it cmon offense
amazing hold by the defense they may drag us kicking and screaming to a win
alright ill take that offense just needs to do their job
feed jk
we need to just run the clock and throw intermediate routes to andrews dez and our other wrs we cant take deep shots keep on the up tempo short game
can we get a 2019 10 minute td drive
romo is digging dobbys juice
im getting the sense we hate butler lol
give jk the ball
titans are bitches
i already went to the menu screen and went to challenge play
nice challenge
why cant lamar make wide open throws
hes wide open lamar
but henry gets two yards when he was stopped at the line smh
bullshit spot bullshit play standing and terrible overthrow what a classic ravens sequence
how is no one actually on tannehill on these boots every single time
reminder that we drafted hollywood over brown
sorry but i dont trust this offense to go down and score this game is over and so is the season
the ravens are missing the playoffs
that effort on browns td epitomized this season if this team doesnt make some major changes it wont even make the playoffs let alone contend for a super bowl
the overreactions in this thread fire all the coaches really
this team is so incredibly infuriating to watch
please just win the game fuck overtime
this game should not be going into ot
ravens and killing momentum with dumbass penalties

name a more iconic duo
gotta give props to lamar for moving it down the field like that damn i wish we couldve scored
lets put the guy who constantly makes bad decisions on the field to make this decision lol
feels like it had been forever since we won an ot coin toss
notice how we just forgot about dobbins in the second half
i cant watch this shit anymore
going just as expected
fire greg roman
marcus peters stinks today
only chance is an interception or a punch out and im not optimistic
we really are pussies for letting them come in and disrespect us and blow a lead like we did
this is what rock bottom looks like boys they assfucked us
embarrassment of a team
pathetic to lose to this absolute bum ass team
that fucking hurt man fuck they came into mt and fucking trolled us to start then clowned us and won god damnit
do not go to the titans subreddit and talk shit
we gonna win this game fuck you pussy bitches saying its over
refs fucked this drive fuck you
this team is just so randomly inept on offense false start bad throw dumb pick when were driving with momentum come on
call me fair weather fan idgaf i have zero confidence in this offense completing a comeback drive
fuck the titans man
yet another holding call i hate the way that the ravens seem to be the only team that holds
sweet there was our one play to duvernay for the game
i get lamar is lamar but we cant always rely on him to convert 3rd down by taking on lbs
nice drop soulja
fuck hollywood soulja brown
ah there we go with the drops soulja
just never take a wr in the first round again gets my hopes up
soulja hollywood try detroit
hollywood was already thinking about divinghence drop the ball
get ingram tf outta there and get gus and dobbins in let ingram be a cheerleader until hes healthy
ctrlf soulja

41 results

lmao
lamar put some more heat on the ball man
how is this not a penalty
i think my hate for the titans is nearing steelers level im still pissed about what they did pregame too much trash talk and i hate vrabels face where is this fire in the players on the field
damn malik bodies that guy and henry
malik just tackled two dudes
harrison made the tackles whilst blocked
if they dont put in dev the dude duvernay
wow malik what huge stop
did he say mcqueen
lets goooo queen lit him up
ok offense dont blow this
every time romo talks about the ravens youd think weve won the past 5 super bowls
mcqueen comes in
queen heard us talking shit and bowser heard us calling him a bust and just told us to fuck off
whoever is responsible for taking dobbins out of the game needs to be fired at halftime
this red zone offense is hot garbage
if we just ran jk 3 times were in
lmao the titans are one of the worst red zone defenses in the league and this is what the ravens do
what am i watching rn this is high school level offense
lets take dobbins with his momentum away and lose yards with gus and that stupid play
2 weeks in a row how can you not score with lamar in the redzone fire greg roman fuck his ass im done
our insistence on not putting dobbins in more is one of the more confounding things of any offense in the nfl particularly with an offensive line thats made up of backups
dobbins was gonna score greg roman nah take him out and throw the ball fuck roman fire his fatass
this offensive line is fucking pathetic

feels like an l if they cant get their shit sorted and not lose on every single snap
fuck greg roman
just fucking run it up the middle two times and try a fade to dez higher chance of success than whatever the fuck that was
i love how dobbins was slashing the tits d and then we just take him out of the game to throw three straight incomplete passes
harbaugh deserves just as much blame as greg roman for allowing this farce to continue lamar saves his career and this is how he repays him
great 3 and out d
fuck the titans
marlon shouldnt be playing special teams
i wanna see lamar throw up a 1 on 1 to dez and see what happens
jk has ray rice vision and cuts with better speed
dobbins runs for 10 yards a carry


roman get this mf on the bench stat
dude i have no idea how they still think ingram is productive

jk and gus have looked so much better than him even going back to last season i really dont understand
in fairness the ball is late on lamars part
csn you have a worse name than holden as an o lineman
dobbins will punch it if its short
ngl i love to see dez in there just wish he got more looks
i want ricard to get a td
dobbins taking over as rb1 today
first down dobbins second down dobbins third down dobbins
dobbins is a free elf
i wanted ricard to get a td but i also like dobbins getting it too
the previous review is under review

the previous review of the review is under review
these long ass reviews ruin watching the game live
offense has more time to plan the 2point conversion if they keep reviewing plays
i cant wait till dobbins rips off a fucking 90 yarder hes more than capable

i hope elton and bernie got a ton for that rakuten commercial cuz thats embarrassing af
can easily be oroy just feed him
dobbins henry
i think jk is now our lead back
rub some dirt on it queen
fuck the titans
that is a terrible call that was not below the knee
what are you supposed to do then as a defensive player jfc
rtp is one of the dumbest penalties in the game
he hit him around the waist romo
i would love a questionable call stat because i swear its always us
room fuck off ur only famous for being a cowboy
idc what people are saying yannick has been disruptive af even if hes not getting all the way to the qb
someone needed to scoop that ball
they called that a fumble that actually fucks us on time damn
yannick has been screaming off that edge all day
91 owned this sequence
i love yannick what a player we need to lock him down should be a priority
yannick is starting to get home exciting stuff
crazy theres a team that drops more passes than us
okay can we find a way to keep ngakoue we need for our future years
gostowski never misses against us so those stats dont matter
can you imagine this d when calais gets back cant wait
yikes hope he is okay
no more injuries
why call timeouts and then run it lol
shit that looks horrible hate to see it on either side
yannick getting held or hit in the face every single play still fighting through it
honestly a clean block imo

but he got hurt so its a penalty
can someone explain why we didnt want to go for points there why did we take timeouts literally makes 0 sense man
lamars passing is gonna go crazy once he clicks with bryant
that nfl shop commercial is getting old
were playing better than they are hope we can pull it out
yannick is getting use to our style of play glad he is putting it together
ready to see justice hill bring the hammer down again
defense has done a mostly great job on these screens today theyve been a weakness all season
bruh where tf was this run defense in the playoffs
usupersaiyansandwich you good havent seen you for a while
romo loves dez lol you can hear him trying not to gush but hes still doing it
vrabel is a bitch
thank you insulin shots for everything
this is a underrated rivalry tbh ravens and titans fucking hate eachother
fuck
no more complaining for hollywood a tight end is a better deep threat than he is
thats a dime lamar
was that an actually interesting route combination well i never
but jackson cant throw s
dime
to his credit hollywood sucked the safety away for that td
earl who
that aint fucking earl thomas boi
elliot the king slayer
what the fuck kind of tackling was that peters lmfao man
i feel like peters is good for a burn once a game
damn my condolences for burrow i really like the guy even though i hate the bengals that looked brutal
i guarantee lamar meant to do that shit to butler defending his coach his did that shoulder pad taste butler
karma is a bitch shouldnt have talked so much before the game
lmaoooo skuras playing for the titans now
matt skura the double agent
ok what was the point of that play why was henry being snapped the ball
foot on the throat no mercy
man burrows injury looked awful im genuinely so sad
duv should have kept chasing the ball he stopped the route too early its ok let lamar take shots while we have the lead
you call it an interception

i see a really solid punt that pins them deep
i wish we would let lamar air it out to dez though
win the quarter win the game lets go
this is all on roman we were up and instead of running we threw the game
it wasnt well executed but you have to stretch the field occasionally ints are always annoying i get it the outcome was essentially a punt though relax
seriously this is the most fucking retarded crowd noise in the entire league who tf recorded that ooooooooooooh screaming dude and whos playing it for 3 fucking hours seriously
how is that not first
this is a great drive after they scored points spell the defense and take some momentum from henry

good job o complimentary football
absolute fucking bullshit
this is fucking rigged what the actual fuck
yall say the nfl isnt scripted lmao
fuck the refs man they are such shit heads
romo drunk today
fuck the way they spot the ball for real
i know a lot can happen but i think i need to turn the game off for my mental sanity
peters outside of getting turnovers has not been good in coverage lately
what the fuck is this tackling
well if lamar would have made that throw to andrews perhaps we wouldnt be relying on our beat to shit defense
were pretenders
this is honestly our season here if we can go down and score it would give me some
hope for the season and i think the team some hope too if we dont and lose well maybe 2021 will be better
lamar needs a career highlight here needs to prove he can take over in these moments
friendly reminder we just need a fg
come on guys save the season take it all the way to the house
lamar to hollywood ftw
there need to be team fines for missed tackles this is ridiculous
for fucks sake that was a td
im going to shit my pants if we get a td here
no turnover
these fucking false starts i swear to god
this shit should not even be those close execution has been awful
2nd and 6 with a timeout run the ball
receivers all standing still lol
watch us give up a td
mr automatuck
seriously no one could get open jebus
it is uncanny how many dumbass penalties have screwed us this season our momentum never gets a chance to build
helluva 2 minute drive from lamar and co i wouldve liked if they went and tried a lamar run on that third down i dont think the titans were ready for a run
judon clutch on that coin flip
ok boys a td and we win lets gooo
go win this thing lamar
score a td and send them home
this fucking team never has juice when it matters
fans are allowed to get mad lmao this has been a messy game by everyone not named dobbins or tucker
we just dont deserve this
must be nice to have fucking receivers open once in a while fuck
and there still has not been a flag on titans offense
so houston can beat new england but we cant
trash receivers getting wide open against this elite secondary
their receivers are wide the fuck open while our guys cant get 2 fucking inches
mods just start the blame thread already
so the titans come into our turf disrespect our logo and then come back from a 2113 deficit and beat us in ot this team is a dumpster fire
can we get a wr next year instead of peeling dez off the couch and instagram hero hollywood
marlo and peters have been cooked all day smh

why is throwing away the lead our favorite hobby this is depressing
game was over when they let brown walk into the endzone
i at least love how harb didnt shake dudes hand at the end of the game
thats on duvernay
glad to see dez giving 100 there
fg they dont respect our offence at all makes sense
thats just a bad throw by lamar

andrews shouldve had the td
that was maybe the actual softest roughing the passer ever fuck you romo he hit him around the waste just as he threw it
we could be 83 and 15 game back for the division if we win today and thanksgiving i hope the team realizes this
titans only talking shit because they know that playoff win was a fluke run that game back 9 times outta 10 we win
henry got bitched by elliot spam this all week lmao
vintage flacco arm punt
we are 63 so spoiled cuz our team plays bad

correction 64 still not worried
bold predictions dez will score a td today we will somehow hold henry under 100 we get a jackson 5 today
im very nervous about this game i just dont see how we get it done without bwill and calais
welp offense gone offense
hold huge hold
this team aint making the playoffs
the fb false started on that play just saying
fuck man i hate the titans
looks like harbs is the only one who showed up to fight today so far they s on our crest and we dont care
you know it seems like every game people just keep saying chill were only

and i keep thinking to myself what about this season has made anyone want to chill this season is the perfect season to not chill this season is the perfect season to worry
im glad my expectations for this team are low at this point but jfc this is pretty sad so far
we get a 3 and outand they ramrod us on their first drive wheres the fight at in this team
going to start looking at mock drafts pretty soon how emasculating it is for a team to absolutely rip you apart when youre the 1 seed at home last year in the playoffs then they come dance on our logo before the game we go 3 out and they have absolutely zero problem scoring a td its like a big brother bullying a little brother

i dont know what has to change but this team is pathetic
ingram is a waste of a down rn
whats the point of having souljas if they drop wide open
brown dropped it because he was afraid of getting hit

if you cannot make that easy catch then wtf are you doing in the league
and that right there is why i give lamar so much leash the drop the easiest fucking shit how horrible do we think their other shit is like route running and decision making on options etc
karma for hollywoods tweet
surprise surprisehollywood drops the ball
why even put ingram out there when we have a rb that does each role better
lamar late on the throw for an easy td
i dont wanna hear shit from hollywood until he starts producing souljas dont drop passes that high school receivers would catch
daaaaaamn

thats what we suit hill up for
hill with a sledge hammer how the hell that guy held onto the ball i dont know
we just arent stopping henry without campbell or williams
lets put hill as a 3rd safety
great play by harrison
what a fucking play by malik
huge play by leek
big malik
harrison is strong lol wow
1st quarter flew by
lets fucking go tyrus
steve mcqueen ran that man over antonio romo
yassss what an interception
yall i said we needed a turnover lets get it huge play by bowser
i need lightning mcqueen flair
why you taking dobbins out
need to stop fucking around and keep jk st 1 this is pathetic coaching
those last 3 plays were pathetic
this offense always seems to change shit up when its working jk has momentum and all of a sudden he is taken out leave the man in hes hyped af
roman needs to fucking go
jfc tucker is gonna score all the points aint he back to flacco days
lamar throwing it off his backfoot squarely into the ground with pressure straight up the middle
feels like gro is pulling the same move as the game of thrones writers by subverting expectations and having similar results
these routes are fucking awful dez was running into a safety
at there 22 yard line 3 point fan fucking tastic
bring all receivers to within 5 yards of line of scrimmage and bring in our 4th string running back fucking clown roman
bryant was open he isnt going through his progressions properly
this is starting to feel like the flacco years with a three and out or field goal on every drive
nothing like some greg roman magic to kill the momentum what were those plays
that is the exact play call we all ask for and lamar just didnt even look
i gotta say if your name is greg with a last name of roman i hope i see you nowhere near our org next year
theres no clearer evidence to fire greg roman than that drive right there defense gives you a short field and you dont capitalize get out of here
literally 1 good play every 5 snaps roman is garbage anyone who defends him thinking hes calling a nice game is just delusional and yes i include you stupid ass pundits from baltimore beatdown and these other dumb sites
this o line is ass
lamar is a problem you have a slant and man playing 10 yards off you go there every single play every single time always and forever
if only there was a player who was eating up chunks of yards that we could play its like they dont want to disrespect gusingram but dobbins has been electric on every play
god dobbins rips off two great runs and they take him out for the rest of the drive lmao
fuck rb by committee jk is the only one doing shit out there
yo we got some points on the board couldve been worse but fuck you greg roman
greg romans playcalling is trash thank god we can at least get into tuckers range
greg roman is the guy that selects random plays in madden
fuck the titans
front 7 is locking in great job
brown runs an incredible route because he pushed humphrey 5 yards off him
brown runs an incredible route

as they show a full extension push off on replay
feel the momentum shifting here

2nd half is gonna be fun to watch
so im convinced romo doesnt know who mcphee is this is the second time now he has called him judon
just feed dobbins roman pls you dumb mother fucker
see what happens when you actually play to your strengths
hold up the dolphins 63
lamar needs to throw that sooner
its just andrews he is our wr core
that was a risky play call considering none of our receivers can catch reliably

thank god andrews caught that
thank god my dogs name isnt greg hed be beside me all game
punch it in with dobbins lets go
give it to dobbins
i bet you we try to throw it
lets run the wildcat to ingram s
feed dobbins for the rest of the game stop the other shit
roman appears to have caught on to the fact that he has a good running back he hasnt used
i love how dobbins after his good runs looks at the air like i told yall to leave me in
can we finally start feeding dobbins as the 1 he clearly is that
this officiating this year literally is turning me into a conspiracy theorist like how do we get fucked over and over again
nfl has become such a fucking slow product man
the baltimore robbing dobbins thanks jim
dobbins got me throbbin
jk all goddamn motherfucking day inject it into my veinnnnnns
dobbins leading the league in awkward touchdown celebrations
jk but he aint kidding
bruh our kickoff unit is murdering them on special teams lmao
hey we already surpassed our total number of points in the divisional game

cries in corner
humph gonna be getting clowned for that tannehill juke
queen sat up like the undertaker lmao
lmao harbs has got to be calling these kicks short on purpose that boy is getting fucked up every time lol
queen isnt badly hurt just looked like his nose got fucked up maybe broken
painful hit these guys are tough hell be okay adrenaline will keep him going
tannahill has the longest run of the game
i hate when im watching commercials and they cut in with 30 seconds of football
of course they get an auto first down
that wasnt low fuck you romo
that was not low it was at the waist
fucking refball every time man
ref ball again
he hit him at the waist and fell down to the legs thats not a penalty
horseshit call
how the fuck was that going low
weakest fucking call that was right in the chest
what the fuck that wasnt late or low
yay refs fucking us again
holy fuck this penalty shit gotta stop i feel like we get a god damn roughing every game on a 3rd down stop
good thing were the most penalised team in the league makes it easier to win games
when you stop henry this team is very different then they have to rely on on their qb
yannick has been huge for us we can actually run 4 man pass rushers now
mask goes over your nose jackson
they gave yannick the sack
yannick having a hell of a game
ngakoue is ballin out
good shit d good way to end that bullshit drive
ngucci is playing possessed now i love it
the one time gost doesnt miss smfh
yannic showing out
yannick just earned his contract
i knew that was a fumble live reminded of the 2010 pit playoff game what were we doing
shit hope hes ok
wish we had performed better in the red zone
guys giving to dobbins is our best play lol
why we running the ball with 48 seconds left
last year we wouldve at least attempted to go for a score
roman showing he cant dial up passes here lmao 50 seconds and a timeout and thats what you do lame af
man yoy gotta feel bad if your the guy who caused the injury too
that injury was so fucking gross
primo halftime content funny i promise

dramatic gopher leads to missed field goal minnesota gophers
same hit as mcphee both legal
we need a td on this drive here
this defense will be back to tops in the league when the d line gets healthy
great stop d lets get long surgical drive with a td at the end of it
thats some classic ravens defense i love it so much
guys im happy to report im behind the bar smoking so well get a touchdown
what up to all the lurking titan fans that are already rattled unnerved by injury ridden ravens defense
throw up the mfing x
dez looks hyped
dez got a catch
yo if dez balls out fuck him and andrews would be lit
lmao cry more vrabel you fucking pussy
romo low key reading this sub
free dobby
i love dobbins talking shit someone gotta have swagger on offense
man it feels so weird getting penalty calls against the other team now
where the fuck the complainers at yall loud when we have one bad series
also shoutout mekari playing a solid game
what a fucjing dime goddamn
hollywood pulled the safety to the middle and got andrews wide open big play
lamaaaarrrr
now lets get out there get some revenge for last year time to put tannehil on the ground
mandrews is cooking again boys
this is the lj i know and support on gameday
go stand on the shield now you fucking pussys
holy what a play throw and drive way to respond
andrewsssss
i love edwards as a short yard to gain back but i really feel they need to keep feeding jk for the main load especially going against teams that are gonna stack the box and much as i loved the presence of ingram on the team last year he just hasnt been the same runner this year but is still a solid blocker in the backfield
glad we finally gave jk the nod today starting to look better lets go put up another one
joe burrow may be seriously hurt his left leg got bent sideways when getting hit guy from washington was frantically calling trainers over
omfg i love lamar for that
lmao lamar gave him the shoulder he loves harbs
fuck malcom butler hahaha lamar is a bad ass
lmao lamar is petty af
i love that lamar fuck butler
oh yeah thats savage lamar standing up for our coach
thats my qb
elliott just dethroned king henry there
did anyone clip that lamar thing i want is plastered everywhere
who was looking for that lamar hatred butler just got a shoulder from him after that td absolutely deserved
earl thomas could never
bro elliot is a lunatic out there
holy hold man wtf
huge hold yet again how do they miss these
i can see the holding on this bullshit 56k 720p bootleg stream
genius play call with new center did roman switch sides at the half
lmfao


leave that fancy shit to kamara
henry been down bad today
try that fuck shit and get fucked
marlon going for the strip things you love to see
we smoking on titans pack
we switch offensive coordinators lol
look like roman is calling plays for the titans
side note burrow took a nasty hit probably season ending
can someone tell roman to keep running it
i feel like were seeing the start of a new rivalry here
how is that wendys chicken sandwich new if its classic
damn not joey man
oh shit prayers for burrow
can you really just wrestle a guy down by his head cuz thats what they just did to dez bryant
how was that not a call
wtf duvernay completely stopped on tbe route
the fuck is duvernay doing
see our plays were working so roman had to change it up
that deep shot shoulda been for dez

i dont trust our receivers except andrews making that catch
why did duvernay stop so short looks like he misjudged the ball completely
you see wideouts all over the league at least make a play on the ball we have to fight for the ball
this is why greg roman is not a good oc literally why a deep pass on 1st when you need to burn clock
let dez run deep you coward
who gives a fuck who it was on get em next time its on both of them for all anybody should care
almost identical numbers to ryan tannehill on a bad day bleh
jesus the titans are even more injured than us damn
im past the point of caring what it looks like this week just win the game
pleaseeeee dont choke here
elliotts gonna hurt himself if he keeps hitting like that
another dl injured come on
that interception was killer
vrabel loves the dick nose
wolfe is back
designed runs please
drain the clock run the fucking ball dobbins
why the fuck are we running lamar these plays dont fucking work waste of a down
dude they are playing 10 yards off just keeping throwing those quick routes to dez lamar run why
clutch throw
need iv snead
butler screams big cuck energy
hollywood non existent
thought he got it
you gotta love rgiii
these refs are actual morons
it is really close which is bs for this call is fucking bs
are these refs hungover or something
jesus christ lamar
wide open shit pass
all those cameras and no clear view
cmon lamar goddamn it
we fucked up shouldnt be there but that spot was shit the fix is in
wolfe breaking out today
fuck doomers in this thread
peters is struggling today
lamar couldve easily iced this if he had executed but nopehang the d out to dry instead
no tackling nice
why is a 4th string lb covering their best wr
fucking tackle him how are we so soft my god
fuck this team this team is done stick a fork in them that was a fucking disgrace
lmfao this defense is so goddamn soft
youd think the ravens players were trying to push him into the endzone
repeat of steelers game this team needs major changes to coaching staff
this defense is the softest of all time that was the worst tackling ive ever seen
what in the fuck
this d is obsessed with stripping the ball fucking tackle him
that shouldve been an easy stop
100 deserve to lose this game its fucking laughable we will be lucky to finish 88 might get wins against jax dal or nyg but i bet we drop one of those
good job defense fuck off
hollywood could never do that
this is not a playoff team if you think so i want what youre on
pain im in pain
were either getting a secondarytackling blame of the game or a mandrewslj player of the game
i want this offense to go down and have a clutch game winning drive last one was sf last year that game showed we could grit it out
lamar needs to go win this game period
were out of the playoff picture once we lose this game and then play the undefeated steelers next week

im so disappointed in this team how humiliating to let them come here and dance all over our logo and then they just punch us in the mouth at the end too
i hate to say it but this will be lamars defining moment win and its proof hell be able to lead lose and it will always be questioned if he has what it takes to win in close games it obviously doesnt help hes a one man army but better qbs have done more with less
of course soulja wouldve had a td but theres a flag lmao
id do anything for dez to get the game winner
what the fuck mekari

an empty stadium and you snap and surprise even the qb
please let us get the ball
good on lamar for not forcing a pass
why the fuck did we not go for the 1st and goal holy shit this coaching staff is awful
why cant we just score a td my blood pressure needs to go down
our defense needs to pull their pants up because last drive was an embarrassment
we need the coin toss or else we lose
my heart is beating
hollywood owes us something if we go to over time
would love for dez to poster butler for a gamewinning td
hollywood brown zero receptions

but hey go off kid keep those tweets coming
we won dat toss
lets get a fucking td please
here we go first possession td for dez
go go lamar u got this
that play call is rolling over fucking pussy shit
here comes henry
pathetic these read options are not working on first down and just kill the drive man fuck this
fire greg roman
our d aint stopping shit lol
you throw a dump off on your own 25 on 317
corey davis is getting so open how is this happening
fire greg roman
hollywood is just john ross tbh
that was a fucking pathetic display up by 11 and just got bullied
lol this team a joke
i never want to see someone call people who have complaints a fake fan ever again
another hard to watch game this is classic ravens
why do i even bother watching anymore we cant do anything in clutch time
this looks like mental issues something has to happen at the top
season is over
here is the sad part our fans will continue defense these ravens
many people need to be fired starting with greg romans dumb ass
ok marlon has not looked like himself since he came back he has had no fire or heart marcus is just marcus and is verrry overrated
someone needs to wake this team the fuck up
everyones hating that deep shot but like i dont think it was a bad call almost had a killshot completion duvernay just couldnt quite get his head around not the end of the world
genuinely bad throw on that really well designed play to andrews
dez was fucking open
buckle up guys should be a fun finish
lamar keeps missing these throws
this team is fucking soft
just put dez in hes probably honestly our best receiver
god damn can romo stop deepthroating the titans so hard
were bailing them out this drive and of course a bullshit rtp im gonna be heated if they get a td on this drive

henrys hair is fucking ugly as fuck too
damn yall wanted to dance on a logo now a mfs arm gets broke speedy recovery cuzzo
defence cant make a stop and this sub blames lamar lmao
thanks vrabel
skura benched damn
only team that gets called oline holding
legit pi guys come on
get ready for penalties all day boys
jim nantz wants romo money and cant even say marlos name right
this coaching staff is gonna abuse our blitzes but you know we arent gonna change it
winks blitzing on 3rd and long is so fucking annoying
the most tight ends among all tight ends
this team just doesnt look like the ravens anymore week after week same shit
offense needs to ball out
so a new book on the ravens defense scheme for a speedy wr to get a bunch of jet sweep type plays

kc hardman

indy harris

tenn batson
idgaf we still winning fuck the titans
this is the 8th consecutive game where the game thread is saying we are over reacting and its only 2 drives this shits been a problem for weeks we arent that good
what happened in the beginning of the game between us harbs was fired up
malcom butler a lil bitch
lol soldier
fuck hollywood
im fucking done with brown get the fuck out of here youre trash
what a fucking soulja
yeah tell me again how great hollywood brown is dude is a straight up bum
when you try to use your souljas
hollywood plays too scared you could see the moment the ball touches his hands hes looking for the closest defender
man hollywood aint shit
soulja
hollywood butter fingers brown
whats the point of having soliders that drop the fucking ball
fuck you roman fuck you
there goes our soulja dropping a catch again
douvernay over the soulja
dobbins need to be 1
marquise brown sucks he fucking sucks
yo we need to bench ingram he looks washed love the guy but it isnt working
underrated positive thing obj has stepped up at lt
hollywood perception future all pro potential star under utilized just a bust
damn that wouldve been an awesome td
we didnt execute but that is a great play call
the ref looks like rich eisen
heroic play there tough
fgs not gonna be enough if our defense stays limp
the bengals beat the titans what do they have that we dont
that was a good drive bros
hill oh my god
thats how you tackle
justice hill

fuck yeah
wait that was justice fucking hill put him in at lb idgaf
justice hill has the fire
harrison is a really promising player hes an absolute force taking on blockers
fucking huuuuge
good hit by queen
that hit tho
queen fucked tannehill up too damn
bowser has been one of our best players in silence
big play lets gooo
what we needed
wow queen has elite speed
queen
wink also deserves credit on that beautiful cover blitz play
now yall love queen again eh lol
roman fuck you keep it simple stupid dobbins getting 6 yards a carry and you put us right back in empty fuck empty omg
we take dobbins out for that bs play cmon roman
that rollout was fine but no wr made any move to get open
we need a change at oc
dez was open
outside of dobbins this offense is tortuous to watch my god
this is why roman needs to go
the redzone offense makes me wanna fucking throw up
1st and goal used to be a guarenteed td this offense has fallen so fucking far from last year
man our recivers suck and greg roman cant sceme them cant even use dobbins
fuck you greg roman
greg roman was an inside job
why dont we keep passing with our god awful oline while were at it too lets just run it until we get close then get stuffed because we want to pass it in
dude was tackling snead for before lamar even threw the ball if youre gonna to call it call it for both sides
holy shit fuck you roman
in the redzone you dont even have him look at dez in his progression its that shit that drives me crazy in this scheme
those last 3 plays sum up whats wrong with the offense this year
roman needs to go this is inexcusable
does anybody honestly believe we shouldnt clean house after this year with the coaches and coordinators
just so we are clear the rb coach decides which rb should be on the fieldand he should be fired

you dont take dobbins out there
why did greg roman take out jk he was feasting
i know its a joke but i will seriously do a better job calling the plays read dives and powers with dobbins until they stop it 0 empty set no cute shit who says no
this isnt even about gameplan anymore this is all mental now its in their heads no confidence all panic
we get one year of great offense and its back to the normal disappointing performance
man our recivers suck and greg roman cant sceme them cant even use dobbins
lamar didnt even look at the left side of the field bruh
roman said this offense was going to change substantially fuck its changed its even worse
lets give dobbins the ball more greg roman he is hot
time for greggy boy to update the ole resume what a trainwreck
great play of defense and we cant give them any scoring support something has to give
this play shouldve been the 1st down play quick pass to dez let him get a few yards then run it in but no we need to do some bullshit that goes nowhere first
dude justice hill honesty might play some defensive snaps if he keeps this shit up
if that redzone trip wasnt the perfect microcosm of greg roman idk what is
at least justice hill is playing like an animal on st
maybe justice hill should play defense lol
justice hill with another great tackle put him in at lb
honestly the caution tape for an oline and butterfingers receivers are really a testament to how good lamar is
justice hill future hof linebacker
justice hill is awesome on special teams

justice hill sucks as a running back

please no more justice hill on offense stick to using him where hes actually good
i just want harbaugh to be real with the fans if you keep gro its because you think this is lamars ceiling and it sure as hell isnt
covert hill to a db
getoffthefield
wait henry is the only guy in the nfl averaging over 100 yards per game for rbs right now that seems hard to believe
does derrick henrys hair piss anyone else off or just me
roman put in jk you fucking idiot
please keep feeding jk please coaches be smart ingram doesnt have juice anymore and gus is the power back
thats an 11 yard run by dobbins if roman takes him out he absolutely needs to go no fucking excuse
jk is such a beast man great vision elusive and extremely explosive
jk is the best rb on the field today
dobbins is getting four or five yards on plays ingram would get hit in the backfield its black white dobbins should be our starter
dobbins needs the ball
a bigger wr gets that
unpopular opinion dobbins should be starter over ingram
fuck it throw it to andrews or give it to dobbins all game
has dobbins had a single rush under 34 yds this game
lol you guys bitching about a play call that worked
great drive but why do all our route concepts have to be right on top of each other there were 3 receivers in frame when andrews caught that ball
i just love that i cant watch the game because bitch ass washington is on cbs
yall ready for roman to call some complicated bullshit on first down for a loss incompletiondrop second down throw away third down lamar stopped on obvious keep 4th down

quote me
what he definitely had the first down or am i all wrong
thats not a td but it is a fucking 1st down
great drive called by greg roman
dobbins imagine that looking at you roman
that was a 1st
is dobbins officially the starter yet
im blue dobbins dee dobbins die
wow amazing your clear rb1 scores a td amazing amazing who woulda thunk it
dobbins you are ray rice 20 thank you
dobbins is our 1 rb
jk is our rb full stop
give the man 50 carries a game i think hed still want more
titans with the late hitsok
king dobbins fuck a d henry
just rush it in with dobbins again for the 2point conversion lol
anyone else feel like 49 came in just a tad late there or am i nitpicking
my cat will only watch ravens games and i seriously think its because he thinks lamar is a spider
lets fucking go all day dobbins
we might have officially just seen the changing of the guard
throbbin for dobbins
lamar and jk are going to be nightmare fuel for defenses
i think harbaugh is starting to get on the dobbins train now
that poor titans returner is going to be so sore tomorrow
yo we be trynna kill these returners
dobbins has us throbbin
looks like dobbins is the x factor and him not being in every play will be big dumb
i know dez hasnt had a catch but have seen him hyping up and congratulating teammates multiple times nice to see a great attitude out of him
did queen bang tracy
ouch that ones gotta hurt
damn romo really not holding back on that one
please god save the queen
ngakoue gets pressure man may not have the sacks rn but im glad we have him
if that were the ravens it would have been spotted a yard off
fuck brown how about calling a great play by fort
fuck that rule man
yeah i get protect the qb but fuck no is that a foul
fuck that not low
soft
thats shit man
fucking bullshit call by the refs jesus
refball
so the titans also have a receiver named brown who drops passes

nice
injuries and refs taking their toll
weak af roughing
titans look a little flustered
if belly is low and head is high do you hit him in the diaphragm
lets get a pick fuck the refs
i understand changing roughing the passer to help the safety of qbs but like the extent to where you cant touch a qb is ridiculous now
lj fort gets my unsung hero vote this year
play to the whistle why are we not sprinting at that ball
yannick is starting to show up after a couple quiet games when this team gets healthy again it going to be scary
ngakoueeeeee
big time props to our defense so far theyve been ballin
okay lets do our 48 second drill
the refs gave tennessee a fg and robbed us of a possession
yannick hes fired up today
lmao so were not even trying to score after calling 2 timeouts

hope hes alright
looks painful hope its nothing too serious
does anyone know why injuries are happening so frequently this year
i understand playing is safe but cmon perfect time to take a couple shots down field
thats nasty
dobbins jawing lol
oh jesus that was awful
after all these years youd think harbaugh would know how to manage the clock and have a hurry up offense why run it just take a damn knee at this point
i thought clipping was a low block from behind
who gets ball to start the 2nd half titans
ravens good titans bad
lamar needs to come out and make some more of these throws to really put this one away show them that this vrabel defense doesnt work against him anymore
no offense but eagles games are so boring bro lmao
what a read by elliot there
please dont lay an egg here on offense
wolfe bowser and ellis have played so surprisingly well
now eat some damn clock
update this mexican food got spicy af
dez catches 1
hollywood catches 0
dez hollywood
woooo dez talking trash bro
dobbins is our lord and savior
vrabel crying on the sideline
holy shit so this is how it feels to have penalties go our way
i would absolutely love for dez to score a td on butler
sticking it up their ass and thrusting
andrews is a soldier
yes jackson that is what the fuck im talking about
lets gooooo fuck yeah
mandrews is top 3 tes fight me
this is what happens when lamar has time to throw lets go boys
im loving this ol combo they have out here
fuck these old saggy tits
thats a fucking throw my god lets go
eat a chode malcolm butler
the salt in titans gamethread is making me sooooo happy right now
lamar lmfaoooooo
lol lamar bonking butler
x200b

malcolm butler is a punk
get him lamar lol
love that from lamar
the shoulder check to butler from lji see it
lmfao lamar throwing heavy shade fuck outta my way
hate the titans but the league is worse when franchise guys like henry go down
last year he made are free safety his lead blocker not this year
hope henry is okay but holy fuck deshon i love you
suck it you fuck
way to step up elliot
earl thomas tackling henry nope nope nope nope

deshon elliott tackling henry i will destroy you
earl thomas would never
big ass baby deshaun is what et3 promised
deshon earl
elliot out here destroying these dudes wtf lol
refs refuse to call holding omg
did we trade skura to the titans
dude held so hard he hurt himself
nice when the other team fucks a snap hahaha
lmaoooooooooooo
been a while since ive been fired up but the titans are a bunch of bitches
skura playing for the titans now
ha haaaaaaaaaaa god you hate to see it
that snap was launched into the stratosphere
hahaha suck our collective ass tennessee
titians sub people are hoping they take some dirty shot at lamar what a piece of shit group of fans
butler is so fake hard lmfaoo
dez is making me horny
very hostile indeed
im definitely done with the hollywood experiment dudes a literal chihuahua this season
lamar has the first down and then just moves laterally for no reason come on man
did simmons just shoulder shrug dez asswipe
dammit roman why
dez reminds me of derrick mason
lamar with the arm punt
just run the damn ball
thats not a great throw but thats on duvernay imo he got turned around 2x
only good thing is that was basically a punt
lamar playing gutsy dont mind the arm punt too much would really have liked us to widen the lead though
what is actually supposed to happen on that play because i saw two people just standing there waiting for the ball to come to them
should have be running the ball more at this point to eat clock
idk if that was on lamar or duv but someone was way off
no reason for a 5050 there but what the flying fuck is duvernay doing just stopping
everyone talking shit on the play call honestly taking a deep shot on first down isnt a bad idea we just need to execute it maybe throw it to someone over 510 too
joe flacco would be very proud of that throw
lamar with the arm punt
front 7 shows up and our dbs take the day off
man fuck cbs for putting on the trash football team instead
come on man do not let then back in this
lol elliott no need for the big hit just get him down
its sad when you just straight give them momentum man
there goes our d line
turnover would be nice but the offense needs to finish this game
you cant have a dline this year

god
come on boys great to keep them to 3
milk the clock with dobbins and win this please greg
its not so much the concept the playaction bomb was fine we need to use the play action still

its just how shittily executed it was at the worst possible time
please for the love of god please score
handoff to dobbins screen to dobbins repeat
cant run lamar to the outside use dobbins
missed block looked like skura
snead didnt run the route 1 yard short surprised
lmaoooo snead teasing em
that speed option is the worst play in our book it literally never works
fuck the titans
i really want to see dez get something thats not a screen pass
for some reason the jackson run plays feel very predictable they were always so sneaky with them last year
bad spot
lost the challenge somehow
lol the refs are fucking bias dudd
so sick of these fucking penalties holy shit
oh god please dont blow this game
bull shit
bull shit
bull shit
bull shit
the refs are against us thats it ever since harbs went off im convinced i was mostly joking before but now no way
typical of this team shoot themselves in the foot with penalties exactly when they cant afford to do so
terrible spot soft false start oooh a makeup call after a punt that is worthless
imagine having receivers who could catch
we could really use a fruit punch here
the reffing this year has honestly made every game hard to enjoy
someone needs to make a big play yannick almost got one there
they have like one starting linemen left and we stop blitzing
everyone ready for henry to go in with 20s left
can we please stop them ffs
this defense is absolutely crumbling
how cool would it be to be able to move the ball like that in crunch time
ravens playing two hand touch
this is so hilariously familiar its like watching a replay
our secondary level tackling is fucking unbelievable
lets finish this game how we started shit defense that cant stop anything with an offense that goes nowehere
what the fuck was that
why are you trying to strip it on 3rd and long when you had him wrapped up

finish the fucking tackle
wow bunch of arm tackling pussies
fucking pathetic
bro literally the worst tackling ive ever seen soft ass defense
embarrassing all day long we have been weak on our tackles

peters has been absolutely low effort all day
that was seriously the worst defensive play i have seen this season pathetic
it was 3rd and long just tackle him why are you trying to strip
nah dont tackle him dont worry about it
that was easily the worst defensive drive weve had all year they just bullied us no luck involved no foul play we got beat bad
as someone who used to play rugby i will die on the hill that nfl players are dog shit at tackling
weve contained henry pretty well even with injuries theyre still winning

can we please fire roman now im so sick of his shit
we need a lamar game winning drive we need it
yea this team aint winning a super bowl
want some redemption mr jackson please take it
3 uninspired roman passes incoming
lamar has had to lead potential game winning drives in like 3 of the last 4
that fumble by snead had my heart in my throat
refs woulda let tanner have that snap hes been at zero plenty today
just a reminder your supposed to playing your best ball in novemberdecember yet every week we look slightly worse
this team post bye week has been fuckin brutal to watch man lmao
defense has been outplayed in the second half
come on lamar reigning mvp for a reason
i just want to prove the haters wrong for once
dont want to go to ot against this team touchdown lets go
weird we let lamar do lamar things we get production on offense who knew
romo loves dezz die hard
that was a td
dez anquan bryant
i want a dez td so bad
dez looked open in the end zone
andrews was open tho smh
illegal contact on brown in endzone of course it is missed
i swear snead was wide open on the slant
i hope we get the ball first i dont trust that defense at all right now
false starts come down to coaching we had a td right there
had mark andrews wide open on that 3rd down
thought you couldnt touch the snapper on a kick
we have played so much better than the titans cant believe we are in ot
an ot game with the steelers waiting for us on thursday lol
i cant think of a team with worse starting wideouts and one of ours is a first round pick
win the toss
lets go end this lamar
goal line fade to dez for the dub
judon with his biggest play of the year
judon with the best ravens play on a contested toss all game
diarrhea
fucking quitter mentality roman can get fucked
nice we won the toss

immediate sack and three and out

why do i expect different
our dbs have been quite horrible today
i dont know why i waste my sunday afternoons on this team
marlon was soooo far off his man that mp was closer
imagine getting to the highest football league in the world as a defensive player without knowing how to tackle
fire roman man idc anymore this team needs a fire under its ass
if we stopped choking games away wed be 81 right now
queen failed on that play if he breaks thats a pick6
just not a playoff team no o line and not enough talent on offense defense injured and cant get a stop when needed
yep keep blitzing theyve been throwing quick all day smh
fuck me tits fans def seem like the type to bombard our sub to
at this point i dont even wanna make the playoffs we arent doing shit if we make it and we need the better picks
genuinely hurts watching us go down like this tough year gets tougher
these dudes moms raised some bitches straight up
we fucking suck i dont even want to make the playoffs to watch us put this heartless team on the field
unfucking believeable what a soft team
they seem to have our number i hate the titans
very disappointed in our coverage team today oh well on to the next
somebody needs to be fired a change has to be made this is too fuckin unacceptable
defense is straight dogshit
what a fitting way for this utterly gutless team to lose it
we are frauds but wait were not proper fans if we think that
only 4 days until we get shit on for the world to see again
3 ls in a row is absolutely unacceptable so frustrated with this fucking team i sat through worse stretches and wasnt this frustrated get it to fucking together
why cant ravens get a 64 225lb wr like every fucking team in the nfl
our defense is a complete fucking embarrassment
yeah marquise brown needs to produce or we trade him in offseason
ingram ypc 17

dobbins ypc like 6

lets feed ingram roman probably
this drive was 100 on greg fucking roman what a fucking retard
somebody who is good at mathstats needs to crunch the numbers with these penalty calls there has to be a statistically significant slew against the ravens
duvernay looks lost that was not on lamar
that was just the worst fucking time to turn it over man

has the soulja even had a catch this game
fuck any team hosting fans while the pandemic is blowing up
mark clayton travis taylor torrey smith perriman hollywood what a mediocre history at drafted wrs
ill be honest we are being kind of bailed out by tennessee play calling too we have not covered well on play action theyve just had some drops
my dog got into the cat food the other day when i took her outside her shit looked exactly like derek henrys hair
no calais campbell no brandon williams

expected result tbh


edit no interior pressure due to those guys missing means they can adjust to our blitz
if we recovered it it would have been incomplete
his hand hit the qb isnt that rushing the passer
i want to see malcolm butler get fuck sticked
why does henrys hair look like that old lady in the wheelchair from spongebob
the passing game has zero flow at all zero
yeah i dont care if i get downvoted for this this team is a bunch of fucking chokers with no heart or grit
people will call you a doomer for being realistic this team is not doing shit this year
marcus peters 4 ints 3 tds 6 sacks

marlon humphrey 6 ff 3 sacks
fuck the titans for that as well as vrabel good for harbaugh telling them to fuck right off
fuck the titans
titans are officially scumbags in my eyes up there with the steelers and browns now
black jerseys baby
fuck the titans
dez on the field
dez caught it
great start this week will be different for sure
3 and out and a penalty nothing new here
thats a good call marlon had his hands all over him
dez catch not going to be shown or reviewed cool
this pass rush is dogshit
his name is humphrey not humphries
stop calling him humphries
romo gives no respect to our team always mispronounces names
we have taken horrible angles to ball carriers all year
jonnu smith who has the most tight ends among all tight ends
i honestly dont think were making the playoffs this year
yeah i dont see us winning this our defense is dead our offensive line is mediocre
theres so much wrong with this team
thats the same exact play jonnu scored on in the playoffs
this game is going to be a tough watch we cannot match up with them physically without williams and campbell it is a damn shame especially how much weve been anticipating this matchup and how much they disrespected us in the pregame
once again penalties are fucking us
can we please just play man coverage
it looks like the titans are running the exact same defense as last time
lamar doesnt run downhill anymore roman is ruining this guy
not gonna lie ive seen absolutely enough of ingram for the rest of the season
hollywood sucks
theres our soulja
brown talks shit about us not using him and then does that
im so tired of hollywood brown dropping passes
soulja gets called to fight and drops the ball
hollywood is a bust for a 1st rounder
if it wasnt for that evil miles boykin i bet hollywood wouldve caught that
soldier
getting tired of brown
soulja soulja soulja soulja
imagine tweeting about your targets and dropping that ball lol
these souljas need to catch
wtf is hollywood soulja brown doing there
use the souljas fuck you hollywood
ingrams stats in this game gonna be like 20 carries for 45 yards arent they
jk touches ball and first down happens cant explain that
how can the coaches see that type of explosion from dobbins and continue wasting snaps with ingram
if jk could pass block hed be a 3 down back
oh wow crazy dobbins for 10 well give it to ingram this play
at least an answer
roman watched how fluker played last week and still let him start at rt this week
fluker is such ass
dont forget those 2 misses were over 60 yarders
seriously how was that not pi on byard
no rb is ever allowed to get into a rhythm because we bench them every other snap
jesus christ hill
damn justice hill for defense
i pray our defense can hold
whoever runs our fake crowd noise is terrible this sounds like a titans home game most of the time
let hope the lbs play better this week last week they were hitting the wrong gaps just about every long run play
nice harrison
malik is going to be a key on this d in the coming years
love me some queen but with our dl being what it is right now i greatly appreciate powerful lbs like harrison
thats your ilb
marlon stuck between the man and the ball but with a great recovery
bowser
need a td no settling
fuck yeah lets go
now thats what i call a big truzz
bowser lets go you stud
there we go queen and bowser lfg
bowser deserves more money than judon lol
bowser
im so so happy bowser is finally blooming please resign for cheap
mcqueen
finally we do something right
mcqueen
good shit bowser
we smokin that tannehill pack
queen is an inconsistent guy because hes a rookie that has played the position for 2 years total love when he flashes like that though
lightning mcqueen
drop count at 3
give dobbins ingrams snaps
its not jackson its our reciving core
feed jk touches 20 carries
the fuck kind of play call is that
why just leave jk in fuck
here comes roman with overdoing it
with dobbins production i dont see how we could ever give ingram the ball love him on the sideline but please
see what happens when greg gets to cute takes out dobbins and fucks up our drive with a shitty play
this is hard to comprehend honestly
jfc what was that play calling
let dez catch it
dez wuz open
whole drive fucked by horrible 1st and 2nd down execution
how the fuck do you have justice hill on instead of jk
good move taking dobbins out roman absolutely nobody
greg roman has justin tucker in his fanasty team
find the largest cannon we can find and fire greg romans obese ass out of it
roman needs to go plain and simple those last three play calls were pathetic
how is it possible to make lamar jackson look like joe flacco
jk needs to be fed this game period
i think its clear lamar does not trust the oline and he shouldnt
who is making the decision to pull rbs when they have the hot hand dobbins had no business on the sideline that drive
fire greg roman
dez had a chancebruh fuck this offense
were not going to win kicking fgs not liking our redzone offense so far plusfucking keep dobbins in
our playbook is full of dust and lamar didnt help either in this drive throw the ball
how does the other team know our plays when we dont
that sequence after dobbins taken out just wow
dobbins should not have come out that was a wasted down and roman needs to be smacked
jk should not be taken off the field in the red zone holy shit
any coach would see the good player doing well and use them

our coaches nah lol fucking change it up thatll confuse em for sure
so justice hill is the new chris moore
fuck it switch hill to safety at this point dude can hit
justice hill the new chris moore
give ball to lamar
give ball to andrews
give ball to dobbins
fuck everybody else

ez win
do we pull the plug on roman after this game or highly unlikely
come on guys we made great plays stop fighting out there damn
if he caught and they didnt call opi
love proche man
can we get a 50 50 shot to dez
starting to develop a patriots hatred with the titans
dobbins is such a beast
dobbins 10 yard quick bench him roman
its almost like dobbins is good
ray k dobbins
this teams reluctance to using rookies needs to fucking go away get duvernay in there jk is fuckin shit up
all aboard the dobbins train
dobbins gonna be our henry for this game
feed dobbins
soulja
i usually hate when people say this and theyre obviously a very good team but the steelers are legit the worst 90 team ive ever seen
much better lamar big time throw
lamar with dhop would be unstoppable we waste so much fucking potential
89 is our soulja
lamar just needs to do thatmore consistently
lamar jackons is my quarterback fuck yall haters
down at the 1 but amazing effort
our nr 1 wr is a te change my mind
3rd and long call four verticals just like in madden
at least we got the first down
ricard just finished at the end of that play
oh my
i wanna see dez go up for a ball dammit
dobbins is getting 45 a clip hes our starter going forward
third thats ridiculous
what the fuck thats a terrible spot he definitely had the first down
feed fuckin jk
dobbins deserved that one he made this drive
thats a soulja
fuck uhhhh the titans
thats a first down you fucks
fuck the titans
bullshit thats clearly a first down
refs keep reviewing and its just giving our d more rest
that block by ricard though
run that score the fuck up
man ricard made a huge block there
49 of tennessee should have been flagged
i hope these refs have a very inconvenient day stub a toe sneeze inside their masks maybe shart a little
jk is having his coming out
thats right feed him
jk is the shitfuck you roman for realizing that sooner
the last 10 minutes has featured 2 plays and 100 commercials
love ingram but dont see how we keep him after this year sadly just doesnt have it anymore
good to see that jimmy kimmel is out there trying new things as a ref
all hail our lord and savior jk dobbins buck allen is smiling down on you
sweet 2 point play
thats 14 the hard way
the 2 point conversion is no good

jk
go in jk
roman just discovered dobbins
turns out jk is the real soulja all along
okay this is dobbins team now

feed my man
good theyve realized dobbins is the man keep using him like that
i like hollywood but this is how you prove you should be used more dobbins is playing with fire and taking advantage of the opportunities
that coulda been flagged we lucky
marlon gonna get roasted for getting juked by tannehill lol
holy shit one of these titan returners is going to die out there today
god hates the ravens
thats a painful play but not enough to keep him out of the game
all these commercials
oh hes fine
damn queen we can not afford to lose anymore players hopefully its just some cuts and scrapes be back for next half
ouch hope hes good to keep playing
yannick with the instant pressure there we go
titans receivers a bunch of souljas
weak ass call
that seemed neither low nor late
god roughing the passer has changed so much than what im used to
that is a bullshit call
eating mexican food rn its so good
that horseshit call is going to give the titans 7 and prevent us from getting the ball back with any real shot before half
i fucking hate tony romo
yannick sighting
why did no one run for that fumble i swear they always run for it when its actually incomplete
if youve been paying attention to yannick this game hes been incredible like every play
yannick got off again
yannick is destroying their lt
thats it ngakoue lad
yannick not getting the sack but really really good at disrupting
titans having all kinds of problems with ngakoue
91s starting to take over
lets get a big return here duv
yannick looks so good today
the browns only scored off a wentz pick 6 wtf
yannick having a huge game
we not going go for the field goal wow
weird ass play call with 40 secstake a shot or take a knee
kinda feel bad that they got another injury

but i also want revenge for last year so im not that mad hope he gets better tho
what kind of fucking play call
dobbins making friends
annoying way to end the half
yeah that arm is broken fuck
everybody mad we ran out the half but this shit aint madden
seeing that guys elbow turn inside out was almost as bad as watching boyles knee do the same
all we had to do was get it to the 50 and tucker can attempt a 68 yardish fg we had nothing to lose and its not unrealistic that he would make it
these nfl shop commercials are never not annoying every now and then the champ is here will pop into my head
so today were rooting the jags eagles broncos and chiefs right
im thinking another turnover and well have this one in the bag
wow nice work judon
anyone else notice that on the ravens apparel they have rav b but on the titans gear its ten t i guess they didnt want tit t on theirs
every single time tannehill is touched now i look for a flag
aye we stopped the screen thats fresh
stomping on the shield at the beginning of the game was a rookie mistake
2 good hits on tann need more
i love proches hands wish we would give him a route sometime
what flags we gonna get this drive holding opi
cary williams with dreads is now named hairy williams
dez
he exists
dez throwin stiff arms already
damn dez looks nice in the black uni
dez bryant spotted
a dez bryant screen pass is a good indication that they will use him more
theres the fire pass it to him again
x
tony gets on my nerves but i also love his knowledge lol
when dez gets a td we will lose it
lamar has carried it 8 tines doesnt even seem that much

romo calls him dobby the house elf
god i am just so happy we are finally letting dobbins work
quit bitching vrabel
dobby is here to stay
dobby strong dobby fast
glad to see lamar finally throw it away on one of those scrambles instead of running oob for a loss of 2
romo has low key dropped 2 rravens memes lmaoooo
romo isnt lying though theyre sagging off dez like crazy give him a screen
jackson to andrews
nice fucking throw
i love it his timing is perfect to andrews
i would like to see a deep contested pass thrown to dez by the end of this game
what a fucking beauty
really shocked the refs didnt call a flag on us for that play they hate when we score
what a throw
lets fucking goooooooo
lj to ma boooooooom
mandrews
lamar action jackson
wow that was a great route combo hollywood post outside to take away the corner and safety
that throw wouldve been money even if andrews was covered
throw it on a dime
yannick is about to eat
cant struggle in the red zone if we through a td outside it
lol at lamar after the touchdown there
hahahahaha punkd his bitch ass
fuck butler
lamar bumpin butler bless that man
butler got fuckin punked lol
lmaooooo talk that shit lamar
oh jeez hope henry is okay you never wanna see that
seriously someone get this man his fucking xbox
elliot instantaneously becomes my favorite player of all times

hope henry is ok though
fuck butler
hahhahaha malcom butler is a clown
henry man i hope youre okay but pay back is a bitch
henry just learned that thats not earl
eat a dick butler
elliot doesnt want to hear anyone say nobody can tackle henry ever again
ever since someone posted the stat on the nfl sub about how close to the middle all of tuckers kicks are its all i can see
elliot is a dog
this is a satisfying revenge game
hope henry is ok but it felt good seeing him get smoked not going to lie
oh man hope henry is alright
the joker
sit down king henry
stomped out
elliot ill fuckn do it again
come on peters
what kind of tackle was that from peters
aaaaand now the secondary is getting soft
we cant defend play action to save our lives
that was an obvious fucking hold holy shit
bro dont even compare stanley and lewan
we all have shitty snappers
they have their own skura
did greg roman call that play
lmaoooooo i am rolling

fuck you tennessee
lol they really tried that
dejavu but for the titans
the irony of that bad snap looool
i upvote everything in this thread
bengals are jinxed boys burrows after having his leg jacked
dez
yes lamar feed everyone
butler is such a bitch lol
didnt realize were allowed to tackle the head now
lamar come on
simmons is such a bitch
i like the call but ugh
that arm strength though
that sucked but i dont have a problem with the thought behind it
duvernay need to keep running
whyd he stop
dont understand why we arent just pounding the defense with dobbins
looked like a 5th grader trying to field a fly ball
first down punt hell yeah
really not even mad at lamar there duvernay looked like he was dancing ballet out there
nice punt
why are people mad that we are showing some aggressiveness and trying to make big plays his team 100 lacks those big plays youre got to take a chance sometimes not always going to work but youve got to try or youll never improve
i dont understand our deep shots our wrs rarely get behind the defense
henry running like ingram today
that pass was not on lamar it was where his receiver shouldve been if he had located the ball on time
could just ran the ball and went up 2 scores heading into the fourth instead we launch a hailmary stupid
ohh look another int
contested catches i wish
not gonna be easy cmon we can step em
defense needs to play strong this last quarter
i know we got a lot of people out on both lines but i gotta feel a bit bad for titans too you hate to see so many injuries with any team
the d is tired
we choke on the most import drives then fuck up on o all the time smdh
this is what i was worried about henry excels against worn down defenses
momentum be gone
we going to let them back in arent we
oh god we are so fucked on the dline
here we fucking go
stupid decision to even call that play that resulted in the pick ridiculous honestly
the fact that we lost to the tits this january officially makes it the longest year ever
maybe we can throw a stupid ass deep pass on first down when were up and driving and let the other team back into the game on a silver god damn platter
tannehill just stares down his receivers need to get an int
this is what the mistake of taking a shot downfield and losing the ball without any points it allows titans to stick with their power runpa game which is their strength if we make it a two score game in the 4th they cant do that there is a time and a place and that ebb and flow of the game was not it fire roman
good stop really needed that
great job d way to hang in there
big stop
a td probably wins the game
a lot of our subs coaching mentality is to play not to lose instead of playing to win if we have a deep shot lets take it we need to start allowing this offense to take lumps to get lamar used to launching it more comfortably
our qb run plays have been ass this year
sneadddd
keep grinding o
lamar you beauty
ayyyy harbs good shit
that better be a first
it looks like he had it and it was a bad spot
after that marcus peters int challenge harbs has a bit more leeway with these challenges lol
his arm is clearly reaching over wtf
fuck the refs
holy shit the refs are screwing us over here
refs are paid to fuck the ravens i swear smh
come the fuck on
jfc this is bullshit
bad throw
seems like every game for the past few weeks the refs have some sort of vendetta against us
dont give those fuckers anything
this is the most frustrating team in the nfl right i mean come on if its not receivers dropping passes its lamar being inaccurate or its the offensive line being a total joke and stupidass penalties etc its like at any one time somebody important is at a high chance of being terrible at the wrong time we should better than this
fuck the eagles
what was queen doing there
peters playing shitty
we had them at their 10 yard line and it took them like 3 plays to get to our side of the field this team is embarrassing
why the fuck do guys have all the cushion in the world against our defense
infinitely envious of all these contested catches the titans players are making
chooooke
im ready for pain
what the fuck was that tackling
nice fucking tackling
made a 5 yard play into a 25 yard play lmao
fellas pls my weekend has been shit enough already
the teams a bunch of fucking chokers
if we fucking lose this
embarrassing my god
whaaaaaaaaaattttttttt
peters is soft as fuck
i love peters but hes been ass this game
nice one peters
are you fucking kidding me is he covered in fucking crisco or something
nice tackling boys
professional choke artists
what the actual fuck is this tackling
peters cant tackle shocker
gotta miss ray lewis
everyones running miles all week after that garbage

holy fucking fuck fuck fuck
humphrey missed tackles on both of browns plays thats disappointing
i cant wait to hear the shit that harbs will be feeding us after this lol
i knew we shouldve taken aj brown over hollywood on draft day and that proved it right there
i wish this season was over
disgusting doomers you say have you been watching denial i say to you
chuck clark is having a horrible game 2 missed tackles 4 1st down passes given up
goddamn humphrey you had a chance just pop the motherfucker fuck that strip right now
this team is a fucking joke can we stop comparing them to mahomes and kc last year now un fucking believable what awful tackling
what an embarrassment
that was just pathetic defense
mvps come back and win this game
this game is the difference between us being in a fairly secure wildcard or having to crap ourselves watching week 17 to get a playoff spot
ph my god so close to fumbling the game away
at least theres no hurricane this time
i dont want ot we cant stop shit on defense
fucking pussies better figure it out
feed dez he wants it
penalty is pathetic but were in fg range so slow it down and take some shots
that may have been a td if not for mekari
that was a td fuck
win this shit
lets go win a fucjing game fuck
we did not lose that challenge earlier fuck that
why dont you run it what the fuck a first down gives us 4 more chances
fucking ot
now we have to rely on the football gods for a coin tossravens woke up today and aimed to make sure i dont wake up tomorrow
i hate overtime rules man
dude landed on the center throw a flag you cowards
but iam a souljaaah waaaa learn to catch soldier and maybe get on a a testosterone cycle
lets go win the game boys big truzz
huge resume building opportunity for lamar
belee
fucking pathetic of course we just shit the bed
nice job offense
yepguess we let them kick a fg for the w
well this is concerning
whelp defense is trash rn and all they need is a fg
i dont understand 2 minutes ago they literally drove down the field now they couldnt even pick up a first down
that brown play is just so lol jesus thats rough
fire greg roman
thats weird i thought the runsackcheckdownpunt offense left with joe and marty
im mentally resigned to being 64 and having the browns ahead of us in the division
we have no fucking heart rn
that false start messed up the entire flow we was gonna score smh
queen shouldve had a fucking pick right there
shut the fuck up nantz and tell us whos hurt
i miss 2019
we are a mediocre team at best a 27 team just beat the patriots we couldnt get more than 3 yards in overtime and the titans are just lazily tossing first downs we suck when it matters and look good against garbage teams when the wins dont matter at all
humphrey is getting whipped today by far his worse game this season
pretenders this year tons of talent but regression and injuries hit hard looking forward to next season
and there you go henry is not stoppable
fitting end
every catch is open
we are fucking awful
i actually dont even know what our defense is doing they are not contesting anything and they arent tackling theyve given up i miss ray lewis
bisciotti needs to step in and can roman since harbs is too much of a chickenshit to do it himself
see yall in the post fuck man
no identity of mental toughness this year
time to make coaching changes no bullshit if we wont thats the season
now on to pittsburgh lets lose another one and end this season


our defense was so bad that drive its insane
perfect frustrating ravens season for this shit year
tell them to get big talented receivers not these midgets that we have

dez was our best receiver today and thats saying something
titans walked in here and really disrespected us we deserved every bit of that too
how come the titans can use playaction to get wide open players without a running qb
this team was just three kids stacked in a trench coat it was all a farce
this team literally makes me sick
i never wouldve thought wed be in 3rd place behind the browns this late in the season our offense showed some signs of life yet was still flat overall im honestly more concerned with a pattycakeplaying defense big ray would be ashamed
such a two faced team this year either we look terrible in the first half of a game and figure it out towards the end or start out hot and lose momentum there has been zero consistency from every player and coach on this team sometimes lamar looks great but just as often hes making dumb plays same goes for everyone on defense and all the coaches making play calls except for justin tucker love that guy
please just run the ball roman you fucking absolute and total imbecile
greg roman is a fat fat fatty douche cockboy dick fart assssssshole
a fucking fake punt and then a roughing the passer on a 3rd down lets just hand them points on a silver platter
that ball was live and our guys didnt go for it sad
damn hope that aint a season ender
i have a goddamn interview in 15 minutes can we just get a quick td so i can feel a little better
we dont need a fucking home run ball right now fuck
duvernay had a really poor read on the ball there lamar threw it a little long but duvernay made a bad adjustment and then didnt move
tbh our d is looking really good even sans campbell and williams
alright if we can pull this win out of our ass im hopeful for thursday
that turnover just depleted all the momentum
that deep throw was actually such a dumb call
why the fuck do so many fans of this team hate lamar fuckin jackson man nearly every other fan base would kill for our guy
of course they kick it they have 0 respect for our offense
roman is still having some suspect play calls but the offense is clicking more
i believe in lamar i dont believe in the other 10
how does this end

hollywood drop

roman dumbassery

lamar turnover bonus points if the lamar turnover happens because the line fails him
harbaugh needs to earn his salary cause this team is sleepwalking into mediocrity
i thought lamar played good again defense just couldnt stop much of anything again
ahhh good old tucker only scoring for us type of game fuck roman is garbage and so is brown
rravens will blame andrews for that lmao
lamars performance this season does not inspire hope in me
everyone spam win the toss
three weeks ago after losing to pittsburgh i said this was a good but not great team im not even sure we are a good team anymore
andrews and lamar need to fight the refs for those penalties
outstanding o line play guys
suck a dick tannehill
so long gay bowser
wtf roman you just gave up a touchdown

can we pls get rid of roman already dude sucks
lamars stats do not reflect the eye test hes been throwing some good balls just a half second off on a couple
goddamnit another stupid penalty extending a drive
tbh the way lamar plays at the end of the half im ok with running it out
i hate greg roman so much

in so sick of these dinosaurs poach a good college oc please
ravens score the sportsball
uh hit to the head there he grabbed him by the head
surprised they didnt go for it gotta have a long drive here
get ready for the taysomlamar takes
this team has 0 clutch factor none cant close anyone good
teams arent scar d of our o they rather give the ball up or get three and hope we have a meltdown its embarrassing
tannehill just drove down the field with relative ease when he had to do it lets see what lamar does
thank god its tony romo commentating
i want the titans to send us a picture of their superbowl trophy if not they can shut the fuck up
whos ready to over react and jump off a cliff when we inevitably start slow
bro harbaugh is such a g hahahahaha
fuck these guys lets beat em down no scrub ass player is gonna yell at harbs like that
fuck tennessee
lets go harbaugh
malcolm butler is a bitch
dez gon fight somebody today bet on it
i dont remember his name but especially fuck that one titans player that decided to slap some m and t bank stadium employees on the ass after the game
dez
this ref crew leads the nfl in holding calls and pi calls

todays gonna be so fun
that was pi humphrey was riding him
rush 7 cant get any pressure
lmao marlo held the whole way
3rd and 11 they throw it behind the los and get the first
lol gonna let a screen get us on 3rd and 11 what is this fucking madden shit
lamar will have to win this game for us
fire roman im over his shitty offense
no excuses for this dfuck injuries next man up
so many tight ends
welp that was good play calling looks like unfortunately it was the titans
we get fooled on every playaction i swear
how many tds are we going to give up to that exact play
team isnt well coached whatsoever every tricky play works as executed against us and we have no tricks or misdirection
were just blitzing and getting no pressure whilst leaving everyone open this happens in all of our losses if wink doesnt stop blitzing we gonna lose thats the trend in all of our losses opposing offense lite up the blitz with pa and then we have to play behind
back to being the underdogs baby
wheres the leadership on this team you lose a very winnable game last week and thats the first two drives of the game
dont overeact guys youre right lets be happy our team cant stop ryan tannehil and cant stop anything
we have looked terrible for multiple weeks its time to stop pretending
im not going to read this thread and im not going to pay that much attention today
we need to figure out how to get pressure without blitzing kc tore us apart on our blitzes and tenn went right to a screen on 3rd and long
not an ideal start still lots of game lets not hit the panic button yet
as they say in soccer this game isnt finishing with 11 men people will be ejected
ingrams done
get hollywood off the field
souljas
ingram stopped at a yard sit him
hollywood has sucked since that tweet
soulja my ass he sucks
wow
soulja
mad frustrating how you drop that pass hollywood
brown is trash and you cant change my mind
souljaaaa
man i do not wanna see ingram out there anymore
extra lineman and cant get one yard fuck this team seriously so sick of shit coordinators for over a decade

get some good fucking creative schemes in
89 is our soulja
sorry hollywood but thats bum status shit
you want to complain about touches you better catch every damn ball hollywood
trade brown cut ingram and most importantly fire roman
jk sighting thank you jfc
thank god we have one nfl quality pass catcher
reason 27 why dobbins and edwards should the starters and not ingram
why have souljas that dont have guns if you cant use them
would you look at that dobbins carry but lets run ingram
can we trade hollywood for terry mclaurin pls
how can the coaching staff not seeing that ingram is a problem
fluker is a fucking bum sign some dude off the street fluker is garbage
lets get a turnover here defense
our offence needs to run through jackson and dobbins everybody else is 5050 at best
this team doesnt have it im not even putting the blame on one person or thing
justice gunner hill
can we put justice hill on defense
daaamm hill nice hit
brown is so annoyinghe is so afraid of being out there on the field that is just sad
i hate henry
special teams is better than offense and defense change my mind
harrison is strong
dayum
fuck yes bitch
lets go
queen just blasted tannehill
that was all steve mcqueen
please do something with this o
d lets fucking go
put justice on defense and bowser on offense
bowser making up for the dropped pick in the playoffs last year
bowser
wheres the queen slander now
beautiful play tannehill gets smacked and a pick lets go
yall were complaining about queen but he just destroyed tannehill and forced that pick
resign bowser
jake from state farm is shredded hes got an 8 pack
patrick mcqueen lol
incoming tdkilling holding call
can we try bowser out at wr
i hope bowser pans out for us
run the ball holy shit
we need 7 here
jk is starting to finally get more snaps maybe the coaching staff got its head outa its ass
lets go guys gotta respond with a td here
will holden is a bad name for an ol lol
look at dobbins go feed him
dobbins is the 1 now neeeeeeds to be and use gus to pound it in the second half
holden is an extremely unfortunate name for an offensive lineman
yeah dobbins should stay in wtf is roman doing taking him out after 2 5 runs jfc
getting way too cute in the red zone
lets take dobbins out after he gets us another first who needs touchdowns anyway we can just keep getting fgs and let them win
seriously need to keep feeding dobbins
offence is pathetic
our o line is not good enough to do those fancy plays
assuming that was a new play from roman
i hate our coaches
i hate our oc i hate our oc i hate our oc i hate our oc i hate our oc i hate our oc i hate our oc i hate our oc
ravens you dumb sobs dont take out dobbins we would of scored
lmao gire greg roman wtf
fgs all day
that series was atrocious
dobbins had every right to be pissed about being pulled wtf was that
honestly this is the first time in a while where im livid at our opponents
good fucking footwork lamar
tuckers our only hope in this game
hate how every time lamar rolls out the receivers are all outside bunched up
man this offense has completely died out there this season it feels like a completely different team from last season
draft linemen
jim nantz trying to jinx tucker
this offense is so trash
our offense is so fucking bad sometimes wake up
great playcalling amazing stuff
could have been a dez td we are ass point blank
jfc dez would have powered that in
fuck greg roman
i am getting frustrated that we dont feed dobbins when he is hot let him open up the field to other plays he wants to run it and we pull him
why is justice hill in the game on big plays
also i stg if we dont keep giving the ball the dobbins hes tearing them up
this might be some of the worst offensive coaching ive ever seen no cap
dez was open
fuck this im tweeting the ravens right now to fire greg thats all i can do yall should too
between ingram still getting carries and after being yanked after efficiently moving the chains dobbins is about to request a trade lmao
fuck greg roman
i cant wait till we fire this trash ass offensive coordinator
fuck greg roman megathread
jk deserves better man
hill is the new chris moore on st
hill has been great on st today
our kick coverage has been real good so far this game
two red zone trips and six points we cant put winning this game on d but thats where we seem to be going
honestly im starting to think roman doesnt wanna give it to jk cuz hes 1 of our only reliably good players
you guys realize 1st and goal and 0 runs
we need to draft our next stud on the interior oline until we shore that up this offense aint doing shit with or wo roman
hill again making the plays on st
ok justice hill is a monster on special teams and we need to keep him
henry getting ran down boys

wink is on point
hill chris moore 20
our offense will form a new identity
i need to see malik lay the hammer on henry please
justice hill rb dpoy
clock was at 0 for literally 2 seconds how was that not delay of game
judon for once peeled off
nice missed opi love how they call tacky shit on marlo and then ignore the obvious push off
good field position need to do something with this
lets go offense
marlon hasnt been pressing as much this season and i wish he would hes a great press db
jk runs like 5 years on his knees lol

edit yards
dobbins is so much better than any other rb on this team its not even funny
feed jk
feed the ball to dobbins
roman you better not mess this up
dobins is running so well
does anyone think dobbins might be good asking for my friend who is an oc
goddamn it you gotta make that play
lamar was late there same throw but earlier is a td
2 for 9 for lamar jesus christ
dez was wide open there but ill take the shot
check it down to dez and let him make a play the chance that hollywood makes that catch is so low
look i clown on hollywood more than most but that one was on lamar
just a little late on that throw but i like the attempt
love the deep shots though keep throwing them
mandrews with the big play
great throw
bench brown and run dez as wr1
keep feeding dobbins
thats my fullbackdt hybrid
thats for ricards door dash
that one is for all the lamar deep ball skeptics
beautiful throw lamar thats what we need
nice truck lets g
gotta wait 8 minutes for the call now
thats ok tho we got a 1st down at the 1
let dobbins get it in
hes down
fuck
the
titans
ngl roman called good plays on this drive but execution was just badhollywoodlj not in sync ol being kinda bad as always
no fucking flags please
dobbins can make a case for oroty if roman lets him go off the rest of the season
so much anxiety watching this game
damn i thought it was a first
that should have been a first down
hes very clearly at the one wtf
thats a fucking crazy call
just milking commercials here
ffs give us the damn td
regardless if he got in or not it is a first down looks like he broke the plane though
jc give us the td ffs
are they going to fuck us again
im not even a ravens fan but gd dobbins runs hard
yall thought we would kick a fg
jk
man thats a fucking td
props to roman for adjusting great play calling but definitely props to the players for the execution great drive
this review better be a payback for that fucked up first down call
anyone else feels like our newly forged identity is very much our old identity
dobbins edwards and lamar are the future of the run ingrams gas is in empty
definitely a 1st down if not a touchdown
i feel like the refs saw the orange ground marker knocked to the side and thought that was the first marker when they called it 3rd and 1

also that last play was obviously a td and they better call it that way
cant wait for another commercial after this 2 pt conversion
trying to rob dob of a td
dobbins show
jk coming out party
x200b

2pt conversion is good
mike vrable has a punchable face and rubs me the wrong way maybe because hes an ex patriot
dobbins easy player of the game so far dudes killing the game
i hope this drive has moved up jks playing time
damn were actually showing some resilience
okay that was awesome
best thing about that drive is that our d is rested
feed mr dobbins goddamnit
dez is a great hype man
dobbins taking over this game
jk is balling
hawks fan here fuc the titans theyre trashy af hope you guys run it up on them
jaylon setting the edge like ray charles smdh
bro our special teams is fucking nasty if im the returner for tennessee im fsir catching fuck those hits lol
how you gonna get juked by ryan t
ingram the ultimate teammate out there celebrating
noooo queen
cleat to the nose is no fun
queen got cleated in the nose
ouch effort ay there though damnit
just a shot to the face he should be fine
damn 7 tackles in the 1st half
no more injures man
anyone else annoyed tony and jim are just cracking jokes with our 1st round pick injured on the field
oh look another commercial the real americas pastime
yannick putting the work
yannick is having his best game so far
we using 4 man rush and ngakoue is getting pressure and our zones are limiting em this is a good no blitzing d
of course there is a flag lol
bs ass flag
thats soft as fuck
i honestly hate the titans more than the steelers i at least respect pittsburgh as a franchise
are you fucking kidding me
the discipline this year does not exist
mcphee and judon are always good for one dumb roughing the passer penalty
we always get roughing the passer at the worst times
if ten scores itll be because of flags
every fucking week
thats an awful penalty
gotta say we been containing henry decently so far
bullshit
what the hell are you supposed to do
i just hate that its always the same stupid shit those penalties happen on the most crucial downs
these mfs got so bailed out this drive
every nfl game 1 or 2 calls decide the game man fuck this
we cant go into half tied with them getting the ball
titans gotta know that refs are keeping them in this gane
romo stfu
gotta hold em to a fg
can we please talk about how queen and harrison give absolutely no fucks when it comes to tackling henry

just be clear i mean theyre playing well against him
fuck this was a fumble
romo go date another blonde bimbo and talk like you did anything in the league but blow divisional leads
why is the clock running
yannick dominating
fuck you nance
yannick lets go
finally that horseshit drive that never shouldve happened comes to a merciful end
yannick is schooling their lt today
a pass rush with only rushing four what is this
holy shit tannehil is so awful without henry going insane
yannick is eating lfg
yannick is a world beater
that play call doesnt scream we want to try and score before halftime
me when the ravens score a td
fuck that looked painful
thats weak football 45 seconds and a to not even gonna try to drive down the field
at the 20 with a middling offense and 1 time out yes get the clock chewed and get the half run it annnnnnd maybe get a chunk play then shift into gear im glad none of you are calling plays
imagine having the best kicker of all time and just taking a knee
i hope we give the steelers first loss of the season im getting drunk on thanksgiving if we do
come in defense keep up the good shit and no penalties
browns offence scored 0 in the first half against the eagles
they said brown would be better this year because he wasnt dealing with nagging injuries they were wrong
wow whatever glitch we had in the first quarter is completely gone
i dont get the shield stomping thing especially before the game
lets goooooo
welcome back officially

dez for 5 and a savage stiff arm fucking keep him in and feed him
dez is back baby

game over nfl
romo makes a good point dez has sooo much space get that ball out quick
yesss feed jk
wait we havent stopped using dobbins because he was doing good do i even know this offense
shut the fuck up vrabel
just joining the chat now

tannehill is fucking rattled homies and dobby is going nuts
what are you arguing you fucking barbarian
screw u romo we called him dobby first
look at what they did to our boy andrews didnt deserve it lol
jesus at some point buy andrews dinner if youre going to be on him that long
it feels so good to have all of the penalties be on the other team for once
vebrel loosing control of his team

they were undisciplined as fuck before the game even started
dobbins is over sitting on the sidelines this season im starting to see the excitement from the ohio fans
a deep throw
lamar did a thing
wow that was a great play call
andrewssss fuck yea
yes fucking lets go
lamar with a dime

joker the king

elliot laying the wood on henry and then ripping the ball out while hes falling goddamn
elliot thomas
hit him again
rip joe burrow 20202020
greg roman i recently found out that establishing the run with dobbins means we can open up the passing game

we will now forge a new offensive identity
peters got roasted
we are going to need to score at least another td looks lkme
who woulda thought we are too physical for the titans lol they belong to deshon elliot
lmfaooooo i swear to god this defense at times
whenever the offense starts clicking the defense shits the bed
someone outsmarted themselves
this is how the playoff game shouldve went
they skurad it
eye poke that shit is unacceptable if on purpose
karma is a bitch hahaha fuck you titans
karma
i love how physical this game is feels like an old pittsburgh game
lol serves you right
when did we trade skura to the titans
sometimes trying to be the smartest dude on the field costs you bigly
haha fuck you
hahahaha
about time these things go our way after the last henry wildcat burn things go full circle
dont play those games
ahhhh just had vietnam flashbacks
ha fucks
revenge hahahaha
nice we got saved by their c

a nice long offensive drive would be nice here
run the ball
going wildcat on 4th and 1 with a monsoon going wildcat with a backup centers first snap of the day

whats the difference
so soulja is now what 0 catches on 3 targets 4 targets
kamar aiken

wait
people who wear masks below their nose are dumber than bricks
fuck you butler your soft af dez run right through you
butler has to be the biggest fucking bitch in the league
ravens legend dez bryant
dez is doing well
dez and proche baby
that was um what
fucking hell
what the fuck was that jesus christ
lamar wanted to go to the sideline to not take the hit but snead got pushed back

thats a smart decision even if it was close
ravens legend dez bryant
that was on duverney
more dez dammit
duvernay got lost
our wrs suck
damnnnn why now
terrible duverney you gotta break that up
honestly im ok with that pick at least hes looking down the field
duvernay not helping out
was that on duvernay
what the fucking fuck is that playcall jk has been ripping them up all game and we have control of the score why why
blew a good ass drive
thats exactely what not to do as a wide receiver
that was on duvernay
pulled the old flacco arm punt
lmao the pass punt throwback to the flacco days
defense is gonna have to stop them somewhere idk where but we got a lot of space to do it
man i wish we could have contained henry this well back in january
with all the injuries i didnt expect our d line to perform this well
can we get one sack please
as a small business owner i appreciate these visa commercials
we reaaaaally need to hold them we cant let them get points and then not score next drive we have to score at least two more fgs or a td and fg
we need a stop theyre getting hot and we cant afford this
elliot is gonna put himself in a wheelchair
nooooooooo
the linebackers are getting caught up in the middle they need to get wide to their assignments
we better hold them to a fg
just like the steelers game that int took all our momentum away if we lose its on that turnover
why cant we set the edge
4 down territory methinks
good hold defense
watch the faaaake
gotta go score now got to
now we need a score to keep this lead going and close out the game
need a long time consuming drive right here gotta get at least a fg
lol elliot was wagging his finger to an empty stadium
dobbins pls
the option is just not working this year
another dumb ass play
lamar use dobby
snead with the clutch catch
snead has put in the work
snead 1 receiver
vintage jackson
number one wr willie snead
nice drive so far a 3 and out would have been a calamity
terrible spot
harbs has stepped up his challenge game this year for sure
very smart challenge
wtf
should have won that
fuck these refs
lamar fucking missed him wide open
refball
annd another over throw
classic penalties to kill a drive
were determined to let them win this game
fucking pathetic
our offense is so ass
fucking open man come on
thats definitely not on roman
bad throw fuck
we seriously are about to fucking throw away this game
jesus the titans have no one left
queen hello
what is peters doing
here we go
get peters off of him
imagine having defenders who could tackle
oh so now its the defenses turn to let us down
just give them the touchdown already fuck me
woah woah woah was that a little person
just let him in
tannehill dribbled it
why is chris board even near aj brown
wow judons actually playing well today
lmao embarrassing
thats horrific defense
lol
that one missed throw to andrews is going to lose this game
atrocious tackling
fucking pathetic unreal
simply embarrassing
who the fuck just carried him into the endzone
that was one of the worst defensive plays of our season how the holy shit did he just keep going
our tackling is atrocious ajb is a monster but he should not be allowed to tank through like that
fucking trash ass secondary wrap up you fucking eggs
how can you blame the offense for this tackling
unacceptable
lol our entire defense cant hold onto anyone to make a tackle another problem weve had all season
can we acknowledge this is on players not making plays and leave our coaches alone
pathetic
cant wait to miss the playoffs
im so fucking done with this defense
defense just got bullied
defense is trash
bunch of choke artists
just let him walk right in guys its cool
titans just embrassed us at home
well heres the season
i mean peters whiffing the tackle makes sense but jesus wtf is everyone else doing
fuck this horseshit
well time for lamar to throw the ball fuck
i know we have issues with offense but a drive like that really i gotta be pissed at the defense
i like chuck but you cant be getting shed by a wr if youre gonna play ss
i mean if we lose it sucks but i can get over it but losing like thisthats totally different
i have zero confidence in the offense to get past midfield as well
blame of the game peters
cant wait to lose off dumb penalties on this last drive
gonna be yet another close game the ravens lose because of their own incompetence i keep waiting for it to even out but this team finds a way to fail every week
i have absolutely no confidence in this offense the way theyve looked
terrible tackling
that was embarrassing we need to be able to make stops
d forgot how to tackle around the ankles
so we hold the tits to 24 no excuse
im in spain without the s
watching football hurts now
the thing is i know we arent bad record wise but this team gives me such 2017 feels right now it keeps me up at night wasnt asking for 142 again but for the love of christ can we lose without all the bs
workem lammie
lamar needs to prove himself no one cares what you did last season at this point
peters is pplaying like hes scared of contact
non believers can stfu fake ass fans
truss levels building
come on guys go go go
dez
dez
lets play to win not overtime
that was a td
belee
we absolutely do not want overtime
yall got any more of them false starts

there will be no blame of the game
they need to address these panalties man its killing us
i really hope we dont fuck this up i dont like snatching defeat rom the jaws of victory
good decision by lamar
no one can get open jfc
damnit i wanted a td so we didnt have to play ot since we literally play thursday
why not run we had a timeout what is that call there man wtf
so disappointing they give us the win and we decline it fuck this
thank god for tucker
awful wheres dobbins
overtime im here for it big boy football little boys go home
good drive on o give us the ball take us home
all the receivers standing still
that should have been a flag
the glory days of having a heart attack every game and letting tucker carry the team
the tucker jersey is on boys
why do our centers fucking hate us
andrews was right in front of the goal line
lamars only has only had one ot in his career right
rally caps
stunt on these hoes
lets go lamar build that legacy baby
thank fucking god
i want to see a fuck tonne of dobbins here
its the belee quarter boys and girls lets get it
the biggest issue seems to be the red zone offense theyve been there plenty of times in several games and come up with fg 3 times in this game they couldnt get a td just one game time is the game
dobbins until it stops working please
pathetic
i swear man the rollercoaster of emotions
our oline performances and penalties are costing us the game
ah the ravens
greg roman runs every time on 1st down at least change it up
yeah thats how you lose games ggs yall
lol they just need a fg
gg
i guess they were trying to create the ray rice play
oline getting cooked
ballgame

this loss is worth it if roman gets fired
i fucking hate this team
knew greg would fuck this up
c a n c e r
what does lamars contract look like
dumbass play by not throwing that away
we would need a miracle from this defense
fire greg fucking roman please
im ok with missing the playoffs for better draft pick
wtf was that
marcus peters is trash today
these tiny little plays they make bobble catches turn losses into net gains
im fucking pissed
god dammit another injury
fuck 2020
can we fucking tackle
the difference between us and the titans is they have receivers that can get fucking open
they literally only throw it to david or brown how hard is it to cover that
i cant wait until this team ruins my thanksgiving as well
team looking at 4 straight losses with a shit offense
i went into this week already fullon expecting to be 65 come friday and they still manage to let me down
steelers titans both games we shouldve won but didnt the locker room is slipping away
fuck man our d has no life left
someone better be fucking fired
our front office has managed to avoid criticism but this roster is the problem not very good at lots of spots
gg boys people need to be fired
see ya next season guys
this team is an embarrassment
god dammit can we please tackle henry
i really need to stop waiting until after these games to do my homework lol win or loss im mentally exhausted after
gg this team fuckin sucks
welp thats the game derrick henry is literally the terminator hes a machine that just cant be stopped
3rd place in the afc north here we come
we dont deserve the playoffs
our defense is actually bad
we beat ourselvesagain
god i hate the titans
fire the whole coaching staff at this point
our secondary is overrated as fuck
we had this game
embarrassing way to end the game we officially suck
no dline no oline no comprehension of coverage to the flats no winning team
big truss
time to fire the offensive staff
all this money on the defense they fold this easily
nice way to defend home field boys
i hate watching this team
this team is spineless it showed before the game and in key moments
this is exactly how we lost the playoff game trading fgs while they score tds
call bullshit clipping just because a guy gets hurt but no flag for lowering the helmet on the very next play these refs are as fair and balanced as every major news channel
this sub is soooo toxic
i dont want to hear anybody complaining anymore about fairweather fans those have long gone the people complaining about this team right now are real fans and they have a real reason to complain this team sucks we have absolutely no business of being in the play offs

and yes maybe the fanbase is more toxic than the horrible horrible flacco days because we actually expect something from this team shouldnt have done that
idk how people expect us to be the same team with all of the injuries weve had
unfucking real this shouldve been a 7pt drive
say what you want about lamar but guys are making mistakes all around the lineup that werent made last season
lamar aint having enough time to do anything with these passes
we are not gonna win this game cant execute when we need to against a pretty good tennessee team
pretty impressed at how well were doing so far i was expecting to lose by a lot cuz henry is huge
peters is kind of a bitch sometimes love the guy but also kinda dont like him at times
they gonna try to hurt lamar this drive hand the ball off
goddamnit lamar you had all day
dude we were marching why
why are we not running it every play at this point
bad pass bad call and duv messed up a bit not fighting for it could have just been an incompletion
thats why duv isnt allowed to run more than jet sweeps and screens lol
maybe look at the other angle you dumb fucks
lamar man that throw was dog shit bro
doomers out to play
this team fucking sucks we dont deserve playoffs
that was a delay of game but whatever
dont forget jk with that block tho
for the love of god just dont turn it over
if they turn it over ima kms
another drive that just fucking ends pathetically
this is a battle between 2 teams trying their best to lose who comes out on top
lmao this offense is so fucking pathetic
truss levels are currently in the negative
vrabelichick
fire greg roman right now that motherfucker is so retarded
harrison showing more awareness than queen rn
refs has it out for us guys plain and simple we gotta overcome it
offense costing us big rn lamar missed 34 throws that could have been big and of course dumb penalties
steelers gonna push this teams shit in next week anyone talking bout truss is a fucking idiot at this point
correct me if im wrong but dont you have to at least look at the ball before making contact as a defender
romo hates the ravens
hey guys just a heads up there have only been two drives so far
he doesnt even deserve the hollywood nickname call him dumpster brown cuz hes trash
wasnt too bad but i thought there was a pi based on not playing the ball
field goal aint getting it down with our d
lamar was on the move thats not some cake walk throw to make it was just good coverage tf yall on
you really cant blame roman when someone is schemed open and lamar doesnt make the throw
offense is garbage
commentators need to stop trying to jinx tucker

dude wtf is the reffing this year that was clearly a 1st and clearly a td
if mahomes got the ball back with 50 seconds they would try to score thats all ima say
i love the complaints about running out the clock it was 1st and 20 and this is not madden
lets fucking gooooo
that wasnt even such a bad snap henry just failed there
and thats why duvernay doesnt see much use downfield
thats both on lamar and duvernay a bad route and a bad decision
and yall still blame the receiver right there i dont get it
we let tannehill run for 13 cmon
this game feel really familiar to anyone else
theyre gonna go up 2321 and well lose because of lamar and roman
receivers open on every single play pressure not getting anywhere they gonna march easily
honestly we should just let them score the td
call me a fake fan or whatever but i have zero confidence in this offense getting down the field for even a field goal in a pressure situation
lamar has a chance to prove he can come from behind and win a game late this is a very good opportunity to do it
man i know were all about big truss but i have no truss in our offense coming up big here
this may hurt worse than the divisional gamei thought that was an aberration but it was just the beginning
this secondary couldnt eat shit out the shoes of lewissuggsreed
snead is the fucking man only bright spot on this team lately what a fucking boss
24 points to a playoff team when were down 2 key defenders isnt bad
pathetic we just needed a first down and none of the wrs or tes even bothered to come back no game awareness
i hate this team so much this year since 2014 weve imploded culturally
someone needs to be fired this team is sorry
absolutely fucking pathetic see you next year guys
fuck this team
honestly from top to bottom the 2020 ravens might be the most overrated i have seen
this offense simply isnt very good anymore
colbert is so unfunny
why cant we give dez some big passes fuck man i really hate this offense very incompetent coaches
it looks like roman missed another throw
reminder the titans are 13 the past month and are shredded with injuries on defense
hopefully the everything is fine people who complain are bandwagoners people go away after this
ravens just cant beat the good teams
this sub is so toxic
this week was the first time lamar and hollywood didnt walk in together that seems troubling
alright jim rome im pretty sure no one was even thinking about comparing this years seattle defense to those legion of boomtm squads but its okay you be you
two ravens games this week my dudes

lets feast
nantzromo twice in three weeks were big time now
no matter what our guys say they know this is a revenge game
all of you guys are annoying me have some faith weve been in worse positions against worst ropes against worse odds and somehow harba makes the team play well chill out im seeing negative posts after negative post and we havent even kicked off last i checked we havent been the browns since 1996
harbs ready to square up lmfaooo
malcolm butler is one to talk
ok fuck this team into oblivion please
fuck those scumbags
fuck the titans for trying to disrespect our team good for harbaugh not taking it
fuck the titans
why does 3rd down always come so god damn fast
dez is in
super close love that we have dez to go for that
can they show a replay why that was incomplete
dez xxx
dez caught it
why do we always hold its unbelievable
offense is a tragedy to watch
apparently we are the only team that holds and commits dpi
learn the names humphries
another day full of penalties
holy shit i just realized this is romos first game commenting on his former best receiver or at least in a while
i wanna know how many 3 and outs weve had this year
shit play by marlon
we about to have 18 penalties and the titans will have 1 false start and thatll be how this game goes
ohhhh yes bby gimme one more penalty im almost there
this oline already falling apart sigh
i swear throwing a fucking deep ball in this league ends up being a pi 90 of the time fucking stupid
does this team even do anything in practice we already have two fucking penalties
his name is humphrey not humphries
fucking blitz
humphries

lots of effort there
come on d
humphrey showing earl how to tackle henry
does our oline practice for like 5 mins and go home why are we so undisciplined
this new identity has looked great 3 and out
go 3out defense letting them drive on their first possession

going to be a long day
i hate this fake crowd noise its really distracting
i want this team to go ol and dl heavy and trade future picks for a wr
deciding if i really wanna do this to myself today might be time to watch red zone instead
we have zero defensive line basically this game is pretty much where the offense must put up or shut up
ah yes the most tight ends by tight ends
wow i did not realize our red zone d was that bad thats what no 4 man rush will get you
dickless cowards
this is going to be discouraging
were so scared of henry that it opens up their passing game
what is defense
pathetic display of ravens d our new logo should just be a block of swiss cheese
if this is the team were headed to 88 with wins over bengals and jags

what the actual fuck was that
i literally hold my breath every time this offense takes the field
why do we blitz on 3rd and long
like you almost fight a team before the game even starts and thats how we come out looking lol
please lord give me strength
whos ready for run incomplete pass x2 lol
wink blitzes on 3rd and long against a battered ol guess who gets the first down the check down

we come out running on 1st down on offense for a limited gain leaving lamar in 2nd long to caretake

we man
we need our playmakers on defense to play insane today humphrey peters and queen get yo fumble game on
the 3rd and 11 conversion was the killer unacceptable cant happen clean it up and move on 53 and 12 minutes left
brandon williams and calais campbell are pretty damn important to this team hopefully the offense can get it together
time to disprove the lazy cant play from behind meme once again
do we have a playbook at all looks like no one knows what to do
its sad how obvious it is that nobody fears lamar like they did last season
no dobbins yet tf going on
get ingram out wtf
im telling yall our blitzing tendencies are gonna get us killed if we keep it up teams are coming better and better prepared for it and its annoying see all the open zones
why the fuck is ingram still rb1
wow soulja wow
nice hands soulja
hollywood garbage
lmao thats my soulja
i dont wanna hear a fucking word from marquise brown ever again
i so badly wish we had the chiefs playbook
hollywood has been terrible every since he made those remarks
soulja dropping balls
butterfingers brown better not say a fucking word after this game if we lose
ingram couldnt get 1 yard with 7 offensive linemen crashing the right why is he getting any work over gus and dobbins
soulja
soulja
sit ingram down please
lamar deserves a better team than this
soulja
fuck im behind im about to watch what brown did lol
catch the ball hollywood hes too scared of being hit
lamar and andrews are literally our only offense
cause hes afraid of getting hit
damn that drop by brown this team has been plagued with dropped passes bad snaps ol penalties and just allaround poor performance its been a brutal stretch of ineptitude lately hasnt it
you gotta use your soldiers
ingram can not get shit
soulja sighting
hollywood bust
hollywont
more duvernayprochedezless hollywood
lmao fucking hollywood
let dobbins and duvernay eat god damnit
take notes on that catch soulja
how are any of you blaming ingram when they get to the line immediately
mark andrews might be our most reliable player lmao
soulja cant catch
feed dobby
in one play dez has done more than boykin has in weeks and he even dropped it
im sorry but we need dobbins and gus this game
stop running ingram i love the guy but he aint it
whats the point of having souljas if they cant catch the ball
see what happens when we give it to jk
get ingram out man 3 snaps and 2 yards to show for it
fcking bench ingram
wow the other team got a penalty
hey hollywood how about you catch the fucking ball
a penalty against the other team are we in alternate universe now
godbins
shocked that penalty wasnt against us lol
finally a penalty not against the ravens
mark andrews simply goes in motion out of the backfield to lineup just off the line

theyre really asking andrews to do so much more now
all i heard was a money hooker
i get people are being critical of lamar but his oline gives him little to no time
dobbins gets a run first down ravens okay buddy now go sit on the sideline
hey guys pick up your spirit game isnt over
idk about his fitness level but dez should in every play brown is basically invisible
damn what a hit
fuck i missed the hit
no one can get hot the way we switch in and out rbs
lets get a turnover pls
good shit justice
queen is in for a long day dudes playing on his heels already
haha queen and not being gap disciplined name a better duo
wow we stopped a screen
d line is swiss cheese
feels like our best chance this game is going to be the titans getting too cute and wasting downs like that
fuck injuries
i think weve held henry for about 22 yards so far do that 3 more times and he wont even go for 100 although it doesnt really feel like we are stopping him atm
harrison is a real oneguys gotta step up and make plays
them ohio state boys
yoooooo
lets gooo
lets goooo
fuck yeaa
we need those
we need to resign bowser asap
lets fucking goooo
damn hump thought he had a pick
one of yall said queen is a bust here gtfo
thats that shit i do like
that was beautifully read
good shit boys
see that right there is why we cant give up on queen just yet im at fault too
oh boy what a pick
brooooo queeen
dont hate on king queen
lets fucking go
i love defense
oooh yeah
huge
there we go d light that fire
lets go get a touchdown boys
get in there
sorry guys my bad i didnt have my lamar jersey on i put it on and we got the pick
when did jake from state farm get fuckin yoked
i took all next week off fuck yea
wink still working the d with holes in it but roman cant get a td to save his job smh
god save the queen
finish o
another drop
the offense is so painful to watch week in and week out
isnt dez bryant active today
good fluker benched finally
his name jk but he aint kidding
i said it before and ill keep saying it i really love dobbins
this nigga dobbins is different
i love ingram but its clear last years heavy workload had its toll

dobbins is much more productive
dobbins been a beast anytime hes on the field
dont take dobbins out
start dobbins i am no longer asking
why tf does dobbins come off the field
i would not mind seeing dobbins get 1215 carries today at min
dobbins will become a great for us
what the fuck was that bruh
first down fuck it lets run this stupid ass play
that was one of the ugliest plays ive ever seen
wtf kinda shit was that
jaguars with a shutout
dobbins is so fuckin good please make him the 1 back
ok greg new game plan hand the ball to dobbins throw the ball to duvernay win games
dobbins needs 20 carries a game he is a difference maker
even the announcers are question why dobbins came out of the game lmao
first play inside the 10 and you pull that bullshit ass play out of your hat
let jk cook
red zone offense is pure trash
bruh please play jk
smh dobbins needs to get the load of touches
every run play has been positive yards so lets pass it
roman having hollywood run to a spot and not keep moving around is not a red zone play
please stop
this offense is an absolute fucking joke
can we get a td pass please
fucking three and out
seems like a slant or 2 would help things
only getting a fg is embarrassing
dumb fucking calls jesus fuck
we have to give that to dez hes a grown man he coulda plowed that in easy
this feels like a tucker game tbh
you really need 7 there need another big play for the d here
run the fucking ball
nantz is such a dick
those plays are embarrassingthrow the ball already
our offensive line will be why we lose lamar has 0 time couldnt even throw that quick slant because of how quickly lamar got pushed back
i dont get the reads he is always looking for andrews first who is taken away like in the pats game oh well keep fighting
what a fucking joke
this offense is just impossible to watch
our ol has to be the worst in the league
lets abandon the run at goal line
is it possible to win this game with fgs only
roman needs percentages to call the plays for him his whims are so off dude needs to work off of data i think his schemes are decent but his calls are wrong so often just not a good gametime guy
not getting tds here is going to come back and bite us
we cant be the only ones with enough brain cells to know you stay with the guy playing on fire harbs needs to tell roman to stop being cute and do what he was hired to do
jks reaction to coming off is all of us rn
lamar has 1 targets to throw to every play has a second before hes destroyed and groman fucks up calling plays and we somehow have a 6 in the win column
why did they bench dobbins for rest of that series i am so confused
why are we putting justice hill in the redzone lately
why wouldnt you throw it to dez if theyre gonna give that much separation bad start for the offense all around other than dobbins
greg roman gets super angry when our running backs dont just get stuffed at the line


this is the only logical conclusion to why you wouldnt keep using the only running back not shitting the bed
god damn roman is actual shit
fucking pathetic garbage play calling garbage execution yo lets send out ingram for 1 or 0 yards or call that gus sweep for 2 yards or a scramble for 1 yard like seriously save time and kick the fg garbage offensescheme imagine not running 3 times w dobbins there
damn fluker already got benched dude is speed running uselessness on the line at this point
that first play wasnt a pass they just botched the run so badly it looked like a pass
hill is a stud on special teams this week and last
justice hill has shown up on st holy cow
our kick coverage is killing it at least
justice hill special teams tearin it up
justice hill lfg
hill is a beast on special teams
we really need to give dobbins more carries i dont understand it just gashed their defense on two straight carries and then you pull him
well the special teams is doing well
stream is hella behind today
defense is in shambles and still doing their job lamar needs to come out and make these throws
yannick was in on that pressure
clearly an offensive pass interference
thats how our defense works force 3rd and long entire premise of winks scheme
way to flip the field with solid defence love the grit theyre showing now need our offence to help them out now
we got a stop but will we do something with it
edge lbs did a nice job containing there
if the offense can get goin we can start turning the tides here


defense looks like its gettin it together
amazon has enough money to get any nfl player for their commercials so why do they go with deshaun watson
man titans are playing fucking dirty this game

punches earlier then pushing mcphee into tannehill to draw a flag then this shit after the fair catch
hi remember the last time we fired our oc in the middle of the season and won the super bowl
lamar needs some fucking hatred in his life bro dude out here with the least fuck you swagger ive ever seen and while its probably good in some situations sometimes you need to be able to tap into some aggro
feed dobbins look at him go
jk dobbins every down
dobbins 11 yard rip bench him pls
dobbins is electric coaching is abhorrent to take him out the game so often
keep my nigga dobbins in he literally eats
dobbins with another first and oh yeah take him out agai fucking shit
dob is the starter and thats that
wowwwwww dobbins can run lets take him out now
dobbins is such a beast
make dobbins rb1
dobbins looking sharp and fresh when many rookies traditionally run out of gas
dobbins is tearing this defense up
wow romo said something positive about us we did have the steelers beat
dobby is a good elf
these next 2 weeks might be the most import stretch of the season playing the titans and steelers back to back is huge
game mvp jk dobbins
yes keep feeding dobbins how dumb can we be if we keep giving carries to ingram
fuck henry weve got dobbins
dobbins is really good reminds me a lot of ray rice with how low he gets running and his change of direction
keep giving it to jk til they stop it this aint rocket science
dobbins is our dalvin cook
dobbins the real deal yall
lets gooooooooo
look at that we keep dobbins in and we get 2 first downs on 3 plays what are the odds
roman is so incompetent feed dobbins man
we get way too cute when we get into the rz dobbins was running really well and then we switched to 3 other packages for 2 blown plays across 3 different backs and a field goal

feed the hot hand until he taps out
dobbins will get us to the redzone and we will take him out again
if our offence was in any way competent wed have this game sewn up same as the steelers game fucking killing me
bryant open for another easy first down lol
lamar needs to get that out fucking quicker man jesus christ
ah damn great throw by lamar just a little late
hollywood won that route the ball took too long
soulja
dez was wide open at the marker
he was open late throw
boy how many more excuses can we make for jackson
nice so we dont plan on scoring touchdowns today
dez was wide open at the first down
dobbins is a dog has been all year its a blast watching him run imagine him with us last year
just a tad bit late
thats on lamar bad timing
great name for an ol holden
bruh we need a true number 1 reciver
the duality of lamar
thought that was int lowkey lol
nice throw great catch andrews hell yeah
please give dez a chance in the end zone
dez was wideeee open but lamar loves targeting hollywood
give dobbins the ball now
andrews water receiver than hollywood
what a perfect throw
roman running 4 verts like a madden game
great throw and catch but why are two other receivers within three yards of andrews
just give it to dobbins 3 times
if we had a boldin deandre hopkins style receiver wed be golden
there we go
project pat
great shit by gro starting dobbins the whole drive
damn hes down
give it to dobbins 3 times
oof thats not a score
damn his knee was down early
might be at the 1
missed a facemask
we playing confident now baby lets get it
dobbins is a god
not a td but lets hand it off to ricard let him finish it
hes down short but just run the ball in and score
now thats the ravens we know and love
even though it was short lets get hyped
whats up pat
lol pric youre 300 pounds run that mf over
now put dobbins in and run it in from the 1
i really want them to pass to dez get this guy going hes running sharp routes get him involved lets see that fire
the dez connection will come in due time let dobbins eat
if we can pull out this win and get either bwill andor campbell back for thanksgiving wed be a good shape
still should be a 1st down good shit pat
give dez a td
i think lamar isnt used to a physical receiver and thats why he doesnt look to dez a lot
we fucking hungry
i aint gonna complain about how we get points but id love to see a dez td here
harbs talking shit back to players will always be funny
feed the s l i p p e r y b o i
damn thought he had the first down at least
dobbinsssss
the ball was past the sticks
keep feeding dobbins
dobbins is hungry keep feeding the man
give dobby the ball
bruh jk is tough as hell look at him fight for those extra few inches after being stopped
no way you can overturn that cant see his knee clearly and where the ball is
its weird seeing a big long haired white metalhead looking dude wearing number 82
free dobby
j k all day
get ready for 4th and inches
if its 1st down




well just fucking do it again
thank you wilson we finally have a replacement for haydens hair
inconclusive
how is that not a flag for ten49
new blood new truzz
all of my woadies and coyotes coming together like shottas
feed the elf he is a beast
bruh dobbins is a fucking monster
is dobbins szn
dude is taking the job by the horns
hell yeah
everyone hop on dobbins back straight to the super bowl
feed dobbins
fucking nice play
best decision edc made
dobbins is doing work today keep feeding him
love seeing how hype dez is about everything
dobbins must be fed

damn we beating that returner up poor guy
special teams poppin off too
roman was checking the game thread during the game and realized how good dobbins is
feed jk
i think ingrams gone after this year but man i love having him on our team
youre going to get juked by fucking ryan tannehill my god
how do you get juked by him lmao
i want another pick
blowing them up on every kick return theyre going to need to start calling fair catches
nose got fucked
damn took a cleat to the face
damn that was an ugly looking cleat across the face
having not watched dobbins all season id say this was a career game but honestly hes just getting the snaps he always deserved
hell be fine
thats gonna be a broken nose yikes
wtf was ferguson doing on that play
damn his nose is def broke
we just got sooo lucky
wicked shot thats a tough kid though
so hard hes trying to break henrys foot with his face
that hurt my face looking at that
we doing the game plan we should have executed in the playoffs force tannehill to beat us
damn yannick deserved that sack
yannick caused that incompletion
omg did yall see how fast yannick got there
defense is doing a damn good job at getting pressure without campbell or big brandon
another statless play by yannick
pass rush has been crazy today
yannick with the pressure nice
lmao i literally called that fake punt
great pressure by ngakoue
is there a team less able to handle unexpected shit
i hate how tennesee makes terrible decisions yet doesnt get punished for it
that was just a great fucking throw wtf
fuck the titans man
yannick is half a second slow to making a big play
oh come on now
omg here we go
fuck the titans
2 free conversions
soft call
ngakoue seems to bring the real pressure
of fucking course of fucking course
thats a dumb rule
thats a weak ass call
i almost forgot i was watching a ravens game
okay the fix is fucking in
every week
henry looks worked
penalties are killing us again
lets get another hundo penalty yards
defense gotta hold them to a fg since theyve gotten sloppy
might as wrap qbs in bubble wrap and put them in enclosed cases the way they ref
we need a stop here
can someone actually cover a te
did anybody see henrys head snap back just now
football gods owe us a turnover here
yannick
ngakoue
they get 5 yards on that
cant give this up man
loving this pressure on tannehill titans line looking weaker than expected
huge drop though got the to
thanks for the free timeout tits
yannick is going off
ngakoue bringing it today
pretty impressed with our d so far esp given all the injuries
why not call our third timeout at 3rd down waste of 40 seconds they throw incomplete on this down and wed have had the ball with 130 on the clock
after the way we started ill take 1410 at half pts here would be big
the little jump yannick does is so beautiful to watch hes so smooth
at this point tannehill can smell yannick on every play expecting vrabel and smith adjust and put a te there more often in the second half
istg if they call another penalty on us
poor dude
that looked nasty as hell
maculate conception o
did his arm bend backwards
since when is that an illegal block i thought its only a penalty to go low when theyre engaged up high
going for another touchdown to end the half opposing good player gets hurt lets just take a knee boys
i always hear 100 have sex with the mandalorian am i the only one
dobbins needs to be on the field all the time
we got this bb
they should swap out the bengals and put the titans in the afc north just so we can say fuck the titans twice a year
henry only at 37 yds so far well done ravens d lets keep it up
blatant hold on yannick there
pow

free shots are the best shots
can romo try not to be so bored at the oldschool football
time for offense to match the defenses energy lfg lfg lfg
defense has made some solid adjustments since that first drive
dez
dezzzzzz
dez caught it
dez bryant our dog on the offense
dez bryant
turned no gain into a few not bad
if were gonna call weak ass rtp then thats clear helmet to helmet
jk is raw dogging these defenders
dobbins making something out of nothinglove him
dobby
offense is allowed to open palm facemask how does no commentator seem to know this
tony romo im going to call him dobby
dobby
romo reading the game thread yall
keep crying vrabel
penalties on them
can yo wtf be an official penalty cause that was it
lets go dobby
titans are playing so dirty right now and acting surprised theyre getting called for 10 of it go fuck yourselves
mandrews
beautiful
mandrews
underrated play the throwaway shows the growth albeit small in iq from jackson
hoo boy
lets fucking go
nice throw
uhhhhhh fuck dem titans amirite
that fucking throw lol
regressed as a passer
great play call and great execution
butler thought it was going to hollywood lmao
fucking finally theres the ravens
its amazing what happens when you scheme plays for your playmakers
yall need to truzz this man
mandreeeewwwwssss
lj dimes
does anyone else say money when tucker kicks or am i alone
why is butler going to double cover brown instead of staying in his zone not complaining just weird
now lets route their ass
that overhead shot was beautiful to see lamar sky it and mark break it off to the end zone
hollywood drew a double team thats why andrews is wide open
brinks truck about to pull up to marks house
lmao the titans r so ass i know a lot of us had low expectations about this game but me personally i did not the titans went from being 50 to now 63 that should tell u guys something
that was a fucking dot i hope we open up the vertical passing game more especially during our easy stretch of game to prepare for playoffs
when brown said he souljas comment he wasnt just talking about himself yall loved snead getting targets last week yall love when duvernay gets more targets yall love when dobbins gets all these carries but yall still think he was talking shit like this is exactly what he was talking about feed the players that make plays
lamar lol
lamar
lamar lol
im buying a jackson jersey now
i shouted out of excitement then automatically looked at the bottom waiting for the flag marker it seems like every big play or momentum play we had this year is called back the relief when i saw the kicking unit out man geez
deshon crushed him
hahaha i love that nolook bodycheck
our boys becoming a man love to see it lj
henry got walloped
pop
its amazing what spreading out the receiving routes will do for this offense
thats physical ravens football baby get fucked titans
i love lamar for bumping butler like that
atta boy elliot get rocked
damn lj i love that
atta boy lj
you think lamar did that on purpose idk personally
that looked rough
thats elliot pussy
henry soft
llamajax you dont talk to my coach like that
thats a ravens hit
damn that 3rd down was big really could have started to stamp down on this game
doing almost everything i wish we did in the playoffs against these pricks
henry got lit up
peters owned
deshon elliot is one hell of an athlete man
eddie george vs ray lewis memories there
what the fuck was that from peters terrible coverage and then doesnt even try to tackle him with any force
these throws are killing us
why the hell was he so open
just burned him
field goal
cmon peters
big hold on ellis they gotta call that
lol skurad
lol get cute and get fucked
how is henry even back out there no way he wasnt concussed
wow that looks like fucking matt skura
fuck the titans
thats on henry
skura flashback intensifies
lmao
well that is going to take them out of red zone i guess
lmaoooooooooooooooooooooo
sick play dude
what happened i wasnt watching
not this time bitches get fucked
romo with the freudian slip and changes it up to skurrad
go down and get another td and twist the knife
time to get it o feed dobbins
what happened i wasnt watching
i think this game goes to show just how main coin flips went in titans favour last year and when it evens out or leans ravens how big of a difference it makes
run it down their fucking throats jk send the killlllll
i really hope we win for obvious reasons but also because that shit they pulled before the game will make the look so stupid
has brown caught anything today
jesus our only receiver today is basically mark andrews
brown sucks
proche out there
proche sighting
bench hollywood please
romo was about to run downstairs and tell roman to throw the ball to dez
imagine your defense struggling so much you want dean pees back
proche is here mason 20
guys im not gonna lie i find it so cringe when people say foot on the throat or twist the knife
goddamit
butler mad as hell lmao
wtf why did we call that
what in the hell was that
little too much sauce on that one
wtf was that wobbler
what the actual fuck
98 tryna act tough lol okay
f
thats on duv
like why someone tell me why
we have no one that will win 1 on 1 battles duvernay practically fell on his ass
wait was that on lamar or did duvernay just give up on the route
the offense is back to using arm punts
bruh why we throwing 5050 balls to 511 guys so much come on lamar
what the fuck man its never easy with this offense
ah the fucking arm punt
nice punt lamar learned from the best
jesus just run the fucking ball
fucking bare minimum help for lamar man
honestly thats not even a terrible pass to me duvernay didnt find it or make a play on it
dez has outsnapped hollywood this game i think the fo and coaching staff agrees with us
we are not the chiefs stop throwing unnecessary ass deep throws fuck
if that was a top tier wide out its a huge play one on one coverage and the placement wasnt even bad dev was lost down the field
all the great qbs have a guy then can sling it to downfield sometimes and just have them make a play
that was a good throw im not mad at those calls duv had to do better there
we were doing well we could have just kept running it but damn
derek wolfe says no sir
why do we always kill our own momentum
not much you can do against that good throw good catch
offense just looks off one play its a bad pass another its a bad drop another its a bad play call a lot of inconsistency making drives very choppy
that stat line is creepy
ferguson getting owned on these play action plays
henry fears elliott
judons being held
if elliot played over earl we might have won in the playoffs
looks like the defense has decided to go home early
not wolfe
please hold them here
need some pass rush here
thank whatever god yall worship
odd call imho
offense has to step up right here make a statement dammit have some pride
feed jk
we need a vintage 8 minute td drive right here
i need the name and number of everybody in the nfl thread who was talking about lamar being a backup in three years and how his mvp season was a fluke
i dont hate the long pass call in itself i hate that it was used on 1st down i mean at worst run twice before you throw that and then if you want to use it on 3rd down
i didnt like that play call at all
feed dobbins
big willie
sneeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
wr1
snead bester mann
pitch it and let the rb take the hit man we cant afford to lose you
lol holden was holdin
what the absolute fuck
lets go boys we got this keep fighting
refs once again fucking us over
dammit enough with the flags
were going to get fucked by a shitty spot wow
fucking false start we have no discipline on those
that was bs it should be 3rd and inches
jesus christ
we cant even get a better spot eat a dick
for fucks sake
he was wide open
fucking overthrow
how the fuck does this shit keep happening
lets fucking go
this passing game is fucking garbage
this fucking team
we got screwed on that spot
duh the spot of the ball was short of the line to gain
peters beat again
what the hell are you doing peters
wide open peters got burned again
just hold them to fg jfc
peters again just blowing coverage
need a stop here wtf
what the hell is happening in the secondary
peters getting spanked this half
lol defense checked out
lmao whats a tackle
what the hell are yall doing
well this took a turn
mj yes
judon
okay judon theres that big play 2 more
has peters had any defended pass all game seems like whenever hes on screen its a 20 completion
most fake tough team in the league its crazy
what the fuck is the defense doing
judon did a thing
cmon d
wtf was that
judon with a sack almost forgot he was on the team other than when he commits a dumbass penalty
are you friggin kidding me
wow cant even make a tackle
literally just let him walk it in
god dammit noooo we cant lose to them again
fucking trash fucking tackling holy fucking shit
this is fucking sad bro
that was comically horrible
thats all folks

thats why i dont talk shit
we dont want to win plain and simple
spineless fucking team
cant wait till we blow this game then fuckers on this sub say we dont have a right to be disappointed or we are still an elite team
fucking tackle
soft
queen is way too inconsistent
ok lamar perfect opportunity to prove the haters wrong
are you fucking kidding me
this defense is fucking soft
the defense just quit
we just got bitch slapped wtf
trash ass soft defense wtf
you have got to be fucking kidding
no romo it means the play clock hit 0
gonna go 4 and out
4 people cant bring him down are you fucking kidding me
thats fucking embarrassing
make a tackle 4 players couldnt stop how
absolute trash they had him dead to rights
catch me killing myself tonight boys
where the hell is the heart that we had earlier
pathetic
make a god damn tackle you soft fucks
well cant blame judon he didnt blow 4 straight tackles
lmao this shits just funny at this point like a dark comedy
got to play harder than this anybody thought judon shouldve hit tannehill much harder than this it couldve been at least been a fumble
snuggly soft smh
pcphee took the bait so hard jesus
that was embarrassing and we should be ashamed
fucking meltdown
the only explanation i can come up with for the td play is that the ravens were trying to lose

judon was in another universe in that play
bruh patrick queen making bad decisions all day
finding new ways to lose so disappointed in this team
my joke about both browns dropping everything is now no longer funny
unfuckingreal but also not unreal what the fuck is this year
so typical man shouldnt even come to this
fucking so disgusted
yo snead dont scare me
the tackling in this defense is so beyond atrocious its unfathomable that was the easiest drive the titans will see all season and it was with the game on the line pathetic
this season should be a fucking wake up call for next year these guys thought it was going to be easy after last year
14 unanswered points we havent even gotten into fg range since our last score
lol we got that off too
time to see what this team is made of
that bobble
cant say im very optimistic but well see
game winning two minute drill
can we just get the fg here i mean that really shouldnt be that difficult of a thing to do if we dont then we really need to ramp up construction of the heliocentric orbit insertion device
this drive is going to define lamar i believe hes going to lead us for the win
the thing thats been killing us is penalties on both sides of the ball that is coaching
play for a td not fg please
andrews strong af way to get oob
we should just run it here and get into fg range
go lamar
mandrews on display
use the fucking plays we had last year be smart

but knowing roman hell do something stupid
lj looking nice this drive
dez
ok just dont give it away
false start lol love to see it
forget the fg i want that w
marquise was finally about to do something
dez
gimme a dez game winner
these false starts man
dez xxxxxx
mekari snaps it when nobody expects it fucking hell
another 100 yards in penalties week
that would have been a td
name a better combo our center and trying to throw drives
how did we ever start fluker over holden at right tackle
center messing us up again seems familiar
that wouldve been a td fuck
fuck the refs
touchdown to hollywood lfg
dont give them the ball back
draw to jk then spike
why is he snapping it
please just win it
lets get this dub boys
ot smdh
run it to dobbins please
he had a chance with dez and snead
all that time and nobody can get open smfh
i kinda wish they had a surprise run play in there with a timeout still remaining but oh well
i didnt want to go to ot but guess thats where were headed

finish this one out the right way guys
can the ravens please get some fucking weapons goddamn
overtime baby

anyone else having chest pains
tucker is so good i wasnt even worried aubout that kick
pleaaaaase dont fuck up this drive
was that not a penalty for the guy who jumped over the center
beautiful drive too bad tho
lets get this win in ot
we have done better than i thought least theres that
im punting on first down lol romo is hilarious
x200b

overtime
romo with his tucker love showing
please give us the ball
we got the ballllllll
its your time lamar
we want the ball
big truzzzzz
i belee god dammit lamar lets go man fuck
all the crazy games vs the titans and this is really the first ot game huh wow
come guys lets bring it home
give us a solid drive for 6 lamar come on bro
tails never fails
i just hope our boys are having fun
here comes the 90 yard dobbins run td
lets go lamar they cant stop your shine
pls lamar
dobbins use the man
just what we need before a short week
run the fucking ball why are you trying this fancy nonsense
i hate this offense lol
the fuck was that
needed to bounce out to the right slipped and sacked lmao
omg
a screen

am i in real life
oline play collapses with a chance to win the game and in ot baaaaaaad timing
fuck man thats a fucking joke throw the fucking ball away man
they really dont trust lamar man fuck
well what did we expect 3 and out
hmm guess 64 doesnt sound so bad
that was a quick ot
fire greg roman
its ok i didnt really wanna win anyway
reminder that we would have won if the refs didnt invent a rtp on pernell
roman what the fuck
that was depressing
love when they talk about the nervousness around how far we can punt it and koch is like beeeach
why didnt we use that screen on 2nd
well that was uninspiring
feels like a lack of heart win or lose we got mentally beat
went out with a fart
i have absolutely zero faith in this team except for justin tucker
lol going to lose to gostowski of all kickers great drive their defense is tired from last drive we run for 2 slipsack and checkdown dont worry henry wasnt killing us in the 4th
haha imagine that they get a first down easily
our secondary has been absolute shit for who we have out there
peters or humph show the fuck up please
gg people just leave the thread enjoy your sunday
short run

sack

screen

punt

i dont know what i expected
small truss
corners have been terrible last 15 quarters
this team just doesnt have it this year for whatever reason
man just imagine if we had an oline and could tackle
had him five fucking yards deep
get these kinds on the practice field doing okh drills till they learn to tackle my god
long fg range already
wide fucking open its over
we going into 3rd 3rd thats what this team is
no coverage no tackling
oh wow marcus peters can tackle
we had this game too man we fucking had it
the titans have a banged up line and are slicing up our all pro corners no reason the ravens coudnt have done this against their weak ass defense playing 10 yards off
another injury may as well

fuck this year
we peaked this time last year
were not winning anything this season dont get your hopes up the defense is injured and soft and the offense is hit or miss with crappy oline play rebuild this offseason
this team is defeated
thats it
yup thats game
brown is open every fucking time
we are fucking frauds
thats game what a bullshit team
why are the dbs playing so soft
really do love the taste of swiss cheese
well bye
shit ass team
i can probably tackle better than this team
lmao
defense let them walk all over them
in come the fucking memes jesus that hurts
pathetic just pathetic not ravens football

gotta be some changes after this loss the way we lost plus 2 in a row something has to change we have zero killer instinct and discipline
fuck greg roman
football sucks goodnight
pain
time something happens with this team change needs to be made because this team is an embarrassment
all romo said since the second half started is theyre selling out on the run to stop henry

what the fuck was that then how did the defense get absolutely mauled since the 4th q

and the penalties holy shit i cant take the penalties
the crowd is still more lively than madden 21
pi not even looking at the ball
romo is terrible ive been saying this
i think no preseason is really hurting lamar and his throwing ability
time for lamar to prove he has the stones to complete a 2 minute drill comeback against a good team put up or shut up time
byard never gets his head around how is that not dpi
the fact there is a chance the browns could take second place today makes me feel yikes
nice starting the game with a 3andout and a penalty
without the turnovers this d really is garbage
thats pi thats screening
this is what queen should have done in the endzone
it is so infuriating watching is play teams with defenses that actually defend passes meanwhile we allow 60yac
i was harsh on roman but our players really cant execute and theirs can
this team was built based on fan reception and it shows we went for flashy bullshit and have 0 depth or players than can make a statement and the ones we do we dont use
queen jumping the wrong gaps every time
because dancing will make me want to buy gap clothes
this is gonna be another long day if we dont score during this drive
i have officially turned on hollywood brown not worth a 1st round pick wack
run run run run run overthrow wr by 15 yards run run run pass completion to mark andrews man this playbook is sick
one of our players needs to spit in simmons face before the game ends
friendly reminder that the titans were hoes and almost sank the entire nfl by not following covid protocols earlier in the season
why take the timeouts if youre just gonna run it out
wait a minute is this some sort of offense sorry but those arent allowed
elliot laid the wood
this motherfucker missed everything against the steelers
lets trade hollywood
arm punt on first down interesting play call
if lamar could throw the deep ball before the wr is at the top of their route thatd be greeeeaaattt
awful play call absolutely no reason to make such a risky play
just run the ball control the clock grind out 1st downs

nah im gonna throw a fucking bomb to my undersized 4th round wr woops
humphrey is having some trouble today
time for pass plays here since roman is an idiot
holy shit were going to blow this game i cant believe it
ryan lamar jackson tannehil
defense is crumbling but this is on the offense theyve mostly contained henry for the majority of the game offense has squandered away their opportunities to put it away
we lost i am a lamar stan but i have no faith in him roman bringing us back
choked the steelers game away choked this game away team full of chokers
lamar prove what you can do this fucking drive right here
they the titans and their fans are going to clown us hard after this one and we deserve it
wouldve liked a to see a 5050 ball to dez there
it would be awesome if we could draft some defenders that had arms next year
gg
why did we give marlon 100 mil to be mediocre hes been picked on all game
fuck this team no consistency whatsoever
lamar had a pretty good game
how can you people with optimism still look at this team as good bruh

its ridiculous
this team is a fucking joke this was supposed to be our biggest statement game of the year and we fucking blew it
im not watching on thanksgiving im not trying to have my holiday ruined
not inference on byard can you run into a guy like that
anyone else think romo is actually kind of a garbage announcer
fg aint getting done unless we can get some stops
prayin for henry nonetheless
anyone who thinks that int was lamars fault should go seek out the replay on nflcom or espn duvernay fucked up badly he didnt locate the ball in the air and jumped for it way too early he looked like raheem moore out there inexcusable good receivers catch that ball with that exact positioning of themselves the defender and the ball 9 out of 10 times and break up any chance of an int the other 1 time that was a complete disaster from the receiver that that somehow wound up an int instead
at some point doesnt have to be today or even this season but lamar needs to be able to take a game over with his arm
just let them score here
we deserve the loss now this team needs to sit and rethink what they are doing this season
the browns will make the playoffs but not us 2020 is a trip man
ready to fucking die inside
here come the soulja posts
thats one of those plays where we give up but cant connect on
i hope they give that will holden guy a shot next series fluker cant block anyone
hollywood brown is a 2 at best we know this put dez in
please dont get blown out boys do it for yanda
are we going to have a hayden hurstmark andrews situation with queenharrison now
defense is the only reason we are 63
fucking trash vision by lamar and even worse red zone play calling scheme

this is a god damn waste
is this a battle of who sucks the least today i mean not a whole lot of excitement lol you can blame that on our play calling though
cute play call but well take it
i can literally feel the harbs fury from the suburbs of baltimore
yeah titans offense not doing shit but we keep bailing them out wtf
failing to stop that fourth down play fucked us here
we could be throwing the ball downfield greg roman wtf
i wish they wouldnt show injury replays tbh
im actually surprised that were winningneed offense to put this game away
the fact that cam probably really picked out that guys outfit for that commercial is disturbing lol
shotout to all the people in this sub last week saying this team was done and was going to get steamrolled by the titans
sit your bitch ass down henry
what was peters doing
peters has never been a good cover guy he gives a couple of those plays up every game
man titans looking like the ravens dropped passes and injuries im so glad its not us
jesus that was a gross pass
bad call but duv didnt really fight very hard for it
listen even if greg roman called that its upto lamar to either make that throw or dont do it greg is controlling his arm
if it isnt there dont throw it
why did duvernay tackle better than peters tho
4th quarter time to choke the game away
why were not going to snead more is beyond me
cmon lamar you have to make that throw man
i had a feeling wed lose this game coming in then i see this team showing some life but then the they just choke it away
just let them scoreneed to score again to win anyway
so mentally weak

were obviously still in it but this effort sucks
haha were garbage defense
even if it goes 2424 i dont trust this defense in ot rn
the browns will have a better record than us lmao
expect 3 overthrows in a row and done
how can we be this bad
refs missed the delay of game
zero chance our o takes it even for the tie zero hope in roman
what a play call by tennessee
i am pretty much done this year this team is going nowhere fast
how am i going to make it thru 2020 if i cant even enjoy my football anymore
this team has got a reputation for being mental midgets and after defending them for so long im done after today if they lose
i thought the no call on what should have been delay of game was bad the tackling on the play was even worse
this defense literally imploded holy fuck lol what a meltdown
come on lamar i have faith
blame of the game my ass we got this
my life just flashed in front of me
jesus christ why cant we fucking run the ball
how do you not throw it to dez there
our passing plays are bad man
i fucking hate roman
theres the tuck tail bitch made shit ive come to expect from these pussies
we have already lost
this team has earned that 3rd place in the division no fucking heart top to bottom
honestly if we even make to the playoffs which isnt looking good were going to get creamed in the first round unpopularopinion
welp time to go back to tuning football out of my life at least ill be more productive
our offense and defense are both complete trash right now
this team is soft as baby shit
titans wont do jack in the playoffs as usual anyway
defense literally quit
cant wait for the loyalty police to slam me as a doomer for acknowledging were not making the super bowl this year

you idiots know who you are
maybe we can be bad enough to draft jamarr chase
upvote for all those who believe in our ravens
that should be pi defender wasnt playing the ball
1st and 22 lets run it
this is all coaching dont do a dumb ass challenge with little to gain run it up the middle with gus on third and 1 what was there to gain on the challenge you lost a time out in a close game

look how their offense kills us with a banged up line
they run it well and playaction to wide open players no excuse for our offense we have the advantage of teams devoting resources to lamar
3 yards of endzone behind him throw was short and couldve been the difference between a td and giving a beaten db seconds to recover with the ball mid air
good drive oline still an issue receiving still an issue
what are these retarded motions
im good with the powers hit at least hes busting his as to make a block at the next level
clipping definition in gridiron football clipping is the act of a throwing the body across the back of the leg of an eligible receiver or charging or falling into the back of an opponent below the waist after approaching him from behind provided the opponent is not a runneri dont think that was clipping at all
lamars regression as a passer is so fucking disappointing
marcus peters looks like a bum 50 percent of plays haha
i am done with greg roman we need to protect the ball move the chains and eat clock wtf
how do you fucking let them convert i wish our safeties knew how to fucking break passes up
fuck this team
fucking sorry ass team
this thanksgiving game might be the first ravens steelers game i ever pass on im not letting this shit ruin my thanksgiving fuck whoever scheduled this shit on thanksgiving we arent winning
idk what to expect today
okay this cbs whos in whos out is the dumbest shit ive ever seen
do we start with a spread run n shoot offense
on these hoes thy shall stunt
lets get it yall i dont like our odds with the injuries but if jackson plays well and we keep the ball away from henry i think we got a chance gonna come down to time possession
first im hearing skura got replaced
holy shit the afc is competitive im actually happy 1 more team gets a shot in the playoffs from a neutral standpoint
the game isnt even on in moco its washington and eaglesbrowns wtf
willie snead vs aj brown what a matchup
im struggling to see how this game goes well any given sunday we stand as much chance of winning as they do but its going to be a frustrating game
got a lot of key people out and a new center lets see if this team can spin gold out of straw between harbaugh and jackson i think theyre going to rumpelstiltskin this mofo
thank god they showed that overdose commercial back to back i was able to get some and save my neighbor in 30 seconds
if justin ellis plays as lazy as he played last week derrick henry is setting a record or something
lets gooooo
big truss
bold prediction we hold henry to under 200 yards rushing today
truss up boys
oh fuck the titans
time to put up or shut up new oline and lamar led the pregame hype huddle lets go
washed all of my lucky ravens gear after last week so we should be set
what happened at midfield the titans just took over our logo
your place is at the one yard line bitches
they disrespected the shield its fucking on
come on ravens
gus is starting at rb today
ironic coming from the most nondescript team in the nfl
lol i love harbaugh
butler talks too much
fucking flag
dez bryant
smh
i dont have stats to back me up but the ravens never do well when they get the opening kickoff
lol we started fluker
weird but i think thats the first time ive ever seen a ref with facial hair
solid 3 yards
good start
here we go with the bs
one of those games haha
are you fucking kidding me
here we go with the fucking penalties tired of this mess
yay more penalties again
i am already crabby
i almost cant be bothered already i just cant deal with this again
pass rush is atrocious
refball again god damn fuck the nfl
imagine having more than 2 seconds to pass in the pocket lol
that alone is a reason to take more deep shots
look at marlon man
i hate penalties
an aggressive call on first down what sport are the titans playing
great job wink is going to blitz to stop the run pretty good idea
humphrey looked big mad
when you cant get sacks this happens
humphery tackling henry like that is actually really fucking difficult
no hold on 49
trash d right there
nice takle elliot fucking jesus
so many holds on us and they arent being called fuck it we got to sell the holds more
get that xbox elliott
once again it seems like some teams are allowed to have the receivera engage in blocks before the ball is in the air and for other teams thats called opi
i i just dont i dont understand how this defense is also as predictable as our offensive play calling
last in red zone td yikes
going after queen whats new
really not feeling good about this game
this team isnt even fucking competitive right now everything on this team besides tucker and the secondary is not good enough right now
did anyone else watch the highlights of the playoff game in 2001 where ray lewis stripped eddie george i miss that kind of defense
yall act like we arent missing half our defense and playing probably the best rb in the league
jonnu smith has the most tes out of all tes
teams drive down the field so casually on our defense all the time
offense has to carry today
they flexed on us
we dont run bend but dont break defense anymore we run break but dont bend

seriously it seems like every drive is either a 3 and out or td
lj fort is not so great in coverage is he
defense getting picked apart again
alright offense its your time
massive yikes
that was a very soft defensive series
why do we always fall for the late releases
fucking pathetic
that was a clinic fuck man
id pay money to mute romo
not ideal
so far we have a drop to go 3 and out and a huge penalty to let them cruise down the field for 6 i k ow we are hurt but man can we just wake up a little
is it january again
pain
another one of those daysthis team is soo disappointing
god damn the defense is bad
i remember being super happy for the yannick trade and thinking it was gonna make our pass rush elite boy was i wrong and wish we had those draft picks back i cant say ive heard his name called one single time since the trade swing and a miss there
look at that nice te rollout i wish greg roman could scheme this shit

the mix of runs with bootleg and intermediate out routes to tes and slot wrs are so nice to see titans do what the ravens should so but roman is incapable of it
crazy how much the defense is dependent on calais playing
id like to see a turnover for us
so what did i miss so far
get duvernay out there and spread ten out change something up fuck
what a play wow ugh
lamar needs to run the flying fuck out of the ball
can we get the refs to start tossing players assaulting players out of the game
coaching needs to tighten up lets go
pacing lets turn it on roman ya quack you saw it in the second half of the colts game and it worked
ingram doesnt have it anymore i love him but please feed gus and dobbbins
come on soldier
terrible
hollywood gets no more fucking targets fuck him
fuck marquise
soulja
oh look souljah dropping another first down catch
souljas dont drop balls
jesus hollywood
lol
wow brown really omfg
fucking middle school sized hands
2 drops already wtf
lol these 2 lines are getting punked i understand theres a lot of injuries but ive never seen 300 pounders go backwards as far in my life
holy shit trade some crab cakes for julio jones pls
soulja
our o line is so ass we had to start our benched center lmao
what the hell brown
yeah soulja for sure
mark andrews makes it happen every time
soulja down
hollywood lmao
get ingram out of the game
stop running ingram
ingram sucks coaching has been so ass keeping his snap count up
get brown off the fucking field
ingram sucks this year
take ingram out feed gus and dobbins wtf
where the fuck you at brown what a dumb fucking drop
mark marq
hollywood rlly dropped that
hollywood shouldve kept his mouth shut smh
maybe spend less time tweeting and more time working on your game
look at that burst by dobbins ingram is done no point in using him
andrews and lamar the only ballers on this offense we need to draft a receiver because brown is suspect
when was the last time ingram had a 10 yard run
stop giving the ball to fucking ingram and hollywood jesus christ
to whoever it was i said i thought brown was a better receiver than snead i think i might have been wrong on that one
dobbins time
take ingram out it needs to be the dobbins and edwards show now
omg we actually got a call in our favor
dobbins fast
flucker is god awful is bredson or anyone else that bad
smh
good offensive drive we need the d to step up
fluker is too slow
the titans center missed every practice this week yet still played i dont think ive seen that before
frustrating af
i understand he wasnt the rt but i miss yanda
why cant long snappers be centers like would morgan cox suck at being a center
ok d we gotta come through
much better drive than the first still not what we need
we need more than 3 next time
i cant believe a 59 170 pounder is struggling in the nfl shocking
hill might have to beef up and play some slot
wrap up peters fuck
are they gonna mention the playoff game after every goddamn commercial break
lmao this defense aint stopping this run game
it begins
god damn what a hit
the titans are going to use henry so much his career is going to be real short lol
please ravens lets get the win
middle of this defense needs some beef
queen buddy
i know its early but we really need the d to find a way to keep them out of the end zone on this series
cmon d
every offensive position on our team rn is hot garbage except those with back in the name
i like to see it
perfect defensive play
im sorry mario ryan but your first down is in another castle
thats what im fucking talking bout
lfg lfg lfg
fuck yeah
we needed that so badly
fucking beautiful
who said bowser was ass
so is harrison are staring lb now
lets goooooooo
absolutely beautiful
rock his ass
little boy tannehill
great pressure from queen
bowser has been plying well

lets gooo defense
thats game
did anyone else hear tony romo call patrick queen mcqueen
dont slander my queen
you just got queened
offense has to capitalize cmon need a td
yall need to chill tf out we are still the fucking ravens since when did we get uncomfortable being the underdogs
i expect to see a lot of patrick mcqueen memes tomorrow if we win this game
killa queen
bowser with the int cuz that hit was from queen not a princess
i dont think queen sucks by any means but one play doesnt suddenly make him great either hes a rookie just needs a little work in some areas
not a dark lord but a queeeeennnn terrible as the dawn
lets get the score lets gooooo
now if only bowser or ferguson could keep that high level of play for a whole game and be consistent
can we make a difficult catch please
hollywood needs to make catches like those
lets fucking go
why was that subway commercial funny
dobbins op
keep dobbins in ingram can get minimal touches
seriously keep jk in

ingram should be his relief and gus the pounder in quarters 34
feed dobby
this is why ingram sits
its dobbins day dont take him out
feed jk
why why why why is boykin in there give dez his chance man
feed dobbins
dobbins a beast keep him in
our receivers are bottom 10 in the league at getting open
i feel like were coming down and linemen you suck you get pulled
feed dobbins
dobbins is objectively far better than ingram at this point in his career theres no reason he shouldnt be getting at least 50 of the carries hes phenomenal
why are they taking dobbins out
why tf does bowser look like a better receiver than our actual receiverslol
no hate but if thats ingram thats a 2 yard loss
dobbins is money
jesus fucking christ
what the fuck was that
why we do start fluker and than take him out lol
well at least that was first down
im ready for dobbins to take half the carries and then when theyre tired from chasing him you put in gus to destroy them and ingram for a spell or goalline
dobbins ingram and edwards
thats actually pathetic on roman
dammit gus you gotta focus
thats the fire we need jk thank you
what was edwards thinking there
dobbins is so good ingram should not be on the field much today
keep dobbins in holy shit
might be the worst play call all day
i swear to god i am seeing ray rice in that uniform
greg roman thats it sheesh
holden gonna be the new starter
if i ever see ingram in for dobbins again i might have a stroke feed that man
1 step forward 2 steps back this offence and why take out dobbins thats the coaching decisions i cant stand
can nobody get open every throw is into tight ass windows
gus edwards never needs to run a jet sweep but wtf
what the fuck roman
simple shit working so its time to complicate things to the point where we beat ourselves
ngl ravens lack discipline we gotta know these plays instead of relying solely on innate talent they lack the edge that made them good last year
so much unnecessary motion
edwards blew that play
offensive line lol
i really never want to see an empty backfield in the redzone again
how the fuck is this happening this shit needs to be ironed out in practice wtf
were so pathetic
this committee is fucking idiotic among many other things with this offense
im done
what a poor 1st and goal drive what are these guys thinking
so many miscommunications on offense this year fuck greg roman
how about just running the ball more
this is hard to watch
all it takes is 1 out of 11 to make a mistake on a given play
its so stunning the hot trash our o has turned into in 1 year
bad
this is so bad so fucking bad its all coaching

wtf is this red zone play holy shit
every single offensive lineman was immediately stepping backwards after the snap
lmao fucking jackson shitting the bed again
yikes guys we just arent moving the ball
cant these announcers shut up stop trying to jinx tucker
first round pick is definitely going to a lineman next year
how many times have we been disappointed with the offense in the harbaugh era
too many points left on the board hopefully doesnt come back to hurt them like it did against pats
just a brutal waste of a turnover there come on
why do we always abandon whats working once we hit the red zone
that jet sweep fuckup killed all of our momentum i love this offense but when 1st down doesnt go for positive yardage our linereceivers arent good enough for drop back passing
put justice hill on defense i wanna see something
this offence is painful to watch
hill is having a nice day on specials
justice hill is fucking killing it on st
this o line breaks down withing 2 seconds man
justice hill mvp
who do we have to sacrifice to the football gods to be able to develop and use wrs right
if lamar cant through outside why even line up a receiver out there just throw in an extra tackle a be done with it
lamar missing open wrs because he knows they just gonna drop the ball lol
hill making some great tackles on kickoffs out there today
defense has been decent offense keeps missing opprotunitys left and right
our creative blitzing is confusing the hell out of there ol the coverage just needs to hold up better
man the titans act like they hate us
we need a td and take advantage of these opportunities
tucker game
please lord give dobbins the ball
lol all these scuffles
lets get dobbins going and maybe call play action or some passing concept more than 10 yards so these dbs dont all play 3yds off the line of scrimmage
for those calling for romans head if he were to be fired itd be after the thanksgiving game i think the 4 day turnaround is too short for a new oc
give me a td or give me death
jks vision is ridiculous
okay we definitely need to be playing dobbins more i dont think theres any doubt
dobbins kinda having a breakout game in a crucial match up
stick with dobbins you coward
jk getting too hype greg needs to take him off the field
if we come up empty in the fucking endzone again especially with dobbins running like he is
yes do the feed me dobbins fucking tell roman
dobbins is a fucking monster
king dobbins
eat dobbins eat
dude this mans is a fucking tank and a cheetah jesus christ
dobbins is like ingram was last year holy crap lol
feed jk let that man eat
jk
how the fuck you pull dobbins in the redzone has he had a run for less than 5 yet
did lamar just get titty slapped
we have 19 pass yards good lord
good play by peters too
dobbins is hype af feed him that ball
keep feeding dobbins
clean pocket finally
lamar gotta hit that he was open
needed to be a second earlier
just one deep pass just one jesus
lamar having a bad game
good pass great pass actually brown is fucking tiny though hes not getting that regardless of whos throwing it
dez would catch that td
that was a good playcall by roman
and offense is stalling again
ok everyone wanted lamar to throw deep and he did
trying to catch that on the chest again idk man
our oline is literal cancer complete drive killers

our o line is an absolute joke
if brown wasnt 59 man
brown looks like my 15yr old brother
dez wide fucking open on first
how the fuck do they jump up without looking and manage to hit the ball thats 2 for 2

1 wr make that catch 910 times
mark andrews holy shit yessssss
need to put dez in browns place imo
andrews catching the ball today
ive totally forgotten about andrews glad hes actually showing up today
thats the ravens offense i want
was it holden or false start
mark andrews is the only reliable receiver we have today
you gotta throw that sooner he smoked his ass
mark andrews is so clutch in third down
these are 2 tds lamar missed
why dont we use dez ever
at this rate dobbins will have 100 before halftime
jk henry
our next agent 89
i think lamar may have the most extreme strengths and weaknesses ive ever seen hes like the nfl version of dennis rodman
td here will change this game
hey thanks for the push idiot lol
put duvernay and dez in more
lol they pushed him in
the tackle gave us the td on that play lol
project pat
holy shit we might actually win this
down at the 1
lol not even close
ricard got his food that time
big pat
thanos meme dobbins and mark on thanos face fine ill do it myself
i always get hyped for fb tds for some reason

edit shit
thats coming back but hey itll be 1st and goal at the 1
seems as if weve woken up
gus me
throw it to andrews
just put lamar up the middle under center
lamar playing well today and were moving the ball give the rock to dobbins
vrabel isnt scared to cut his dick off cause he doesnt have anything to lose
i like dobbins too but this play is for gus edwards just a run straight down the middle
pat hit that man like he stole his doordash
this game more than any shows that we need to give the rock majority to dobbins
dont fucking throw put ricard or extra ol in and run it up the gut

of you do anything do a pa out to a te and run everyone else up the gut
run it in dont get cute roman
andrews is so dependable
x200b

sokaywe still got the touchdown
i agree with the call
lets go jk
feed jk
nice
lets fucking go
nice keeping dobbins in the redzone this time
how tf is that not a first
why do i think that roman is surprised this worked
dobbins
luke willson getting juiced for both the pat td call and jks td makes me so happy
get in there bitch
another review smh
jk deserves that one anyway
ray rice baby
i literally love dobbins
whats under review cant yall just give us out damn td and lets move on
so talented
got the 2
that was a nasty play
yeah baby
fuck it just put dobbins at every offensive position

11 dobbins playing on the field is what we need
and love seeing ingram dancing with dobbins on the sidelines
rayk dobbins eatin fuck out the way
anyone got a link
well thats why im not habs
this is what it mustve felt like to watch michael jordan
this will go down as the dobbins game
damn greg roman is killing it with dobbins
fuck yesssss
jk all day
hayden who
yeah we have a rb1 now
can someone make a big boi little boi meme with dobbins and henry
calling it now player of the game is dobby
he does it all wr 1
give dobbins an actual oline and hes gonna be putting up dalvin cook type numbers in a few years
well that was a legitimately great 2pt playcall
props to roman for that play call feed dobbins
a titans player musta dissed dobbins mother
fucking love seeing dez getting so hype and being so supportive so far
that looked like a train wreck at high collision wow
anyone else notice how tucker purposely pooches all his kickoffs to the sideline and lands them at about the 5 this time they got to the 25 but it seems to work out more than it doesnt
dobbins might have the best balance in the league
titans kick returner trying to commit suicide today
horrible play by ferguson
wont be able to watch the game cause im cramming some shit for uni but its good to see the ravens leading

also tuck still automatic i see
man this sub has really changed its tune i also dont like roman but man we gotta stay optimistic we have lamar jackon we always are in the game big truss
that returner gonna be hurting tomorrow
bruh helmet is off fml
fuuuuuuck not queen
our defense needs to not get cocky now and still go for blood with henry
fuck that looked like it hurt
damn queen got straight kicked in the face
okay its just a bloody nose hell be okay
force them into mistakes right on
wouldnt be a big ravens game unless one of our key players got injured this one seems ok though
not been a great game for marlon drop the s humphrys so far
tanny has missed two key throws for us already
pressure is getting to tanny good keep him out of rhythm
ryan tannehil is a wr
hump getting lucky a lot today seems to be out of position a lot
any curb your enthusiasm fans here tracy had something to do with the neck injury made me think of theres only two ways you can injure your neck
yo fuck derrick henry he just straight up cleated my boy pat queen in the fucking face dawg lets knock this clown around
ngaukoue pressure there
no one gonna talk about how that man has 7 tackles and it isnt halftime
dude was wide open
fuck
still no sack but yannick made him throw it
i just called that to my gf
is queen ok
man we got lucky there
yoooo wtf
why are they so open every time
outcoached badly
romo is so good at explaining things that i wouldve never understood makes me respect how good our players are too
yannick disruptive
fuck us
doo doo throw by rt
that stings
good pressure yannick
i just want to see henry get stripped of the ball
fucking jacksonville sucking ass
i smell a fruit punch coming
killer after great stop by d
on a fucking fake
that was a perfect throw though lmao
lj fort is that guy
lj fort with the big play pass coverage has been tight
after all the fake punts we had i can live with the taste of our own medicine
they should just put woodside in seems to pass better than ryan
fort is such a good football player
i feel like any time a team runs a trick play against us it works except the browns of course but theyre the browns
are you fucking serious
how
fuck these refs
bullshit
penalty is fucking ridiculous
seriously every game
fuck these refs
above the knee right as he threw it rtp
i dont think he realized that he got the ball out
how the hell was he supposed to stop in mid air
thats bs
i genuinely forgot ngakoue was on our team
he was already in motion
were we always this bad with penalties yikes man
thats a joke
how sick would a fort jersey be
need to stop them here they get the ball to start the half right
unrelated note i made chesapeake fries ive never missed going to games so much
cant wait for a pa to jonnu smith or corey davis we leave uncovered
put the mask over your nose lamar
yannick again
harrison is gonna be an absolute baller for us in a couple years
fuck off nantz
how is the clock moving
why the fuck is the clock running
ngakoue finally getting pressure
you are all stupid if you thought that wasnt sarcasm
yannick is a monster
big stop
get fulker tf outta here
yannick is eating the depth tackles alive today
so were not even going to try to get down the field
good morning my neighbors
oh a d a flag cool
yeah after the clipping call best to just head into the locker room
the fucking lb jumped back which resulted in the hit not hitting him at the hip come on
dobbins
how are we feeling about this game
missed the first half how did we look
lamar could have been more accurate in the first half hopefully he cleans it up
guac and dobs are showing up big time
ok guys dont blow it
need a quick stop and a quick score time to start putting nails in the coffin
correct me if im wrong but aint we 03 when we start with the ball on offense and 60 when we start on defense
how about a derrick henry fumble recovered by queen
would really like to see more of duvernay on offense offers alot more than boykin
this defense is impressing me so far
really surprised and impressed with the defense there great job
get off the field
excellent defense
wink is coming in fucking clutch
oof bad checkdown
i feel like its been ages since weve seen the offense
hell yeah defense
lets keep stuntin on these hoes boys

this dobbins mf literally does not go down
waahah waaaah waaaah
stfu lol
i think its cool that romo is announcing dezs first reception in 3 years
yes give the fucking ball to dobbins look what happens
penalties on the opposition on two consecutive plays what world are we living in
what are they talking about dobbins didnt grab the mask he pushed it its different
jk all day man hes playing outstanding today
thats what it takes for a call to go in the ravens favor
sorry guys dobby is canceled
bless up refs
wait a defense is making stupid penalties allowing the offense to march straight down the field and it isnt ours
i really like seeing dez on the field
wait is that how teams feel against us
jk to command tower baltimore permission to take off
lol that throw
i just looked up the stat line to see what our receivers are doing combined 2 catches for 9 yards
mark

perfect throw clean catch
thats a big play love to see it
taking boyle away forced them to shake things up losing a good player is never a plus but maybe some small positive can come from it
defense will come out bangin
jackson getting comfortable ooooh cant wait for the others to start stepping up
im no professional but i have been saying all along that getting the run game going would open up the passing game
now we just one of those for dez maybe one for brown too
this is more than i could have bargained for
ugh i have to go to work in an hour someone call out for me
oof burrow got killed
not bad for a running back
lamar

fuck you butler

burrow is probably out for the year nasty hit to the knee
lets fucking go
i love it
deshon omfggggp
god damnnnn
brick wall son
damn that was a huge hit on henry im impressed
thats a big boy play
henry got tuned the fuck up
even big boii henry felt that
derek henry with the bernard pollard hit
fucked him up
well henry if your goal coming into the game was to kick every ravens player in the head what goes around comes around
henry just got bulldozed
great tackle by elliot
oooooooof
bro he brought henry down to his knees literally
hope henrys alright
clean
elliot baby he isnt norman you aint throwing him henry lol
whoever made that thread saying elliot was gonna punish henry great call lol
thats a big boy hit right there deshon made henry his bitch
pressure needs to get there
wtf are we doing
its simply not possible for this team to play well on both sides at once lmao fuck this
why blitz there 3rd 4 against a poor ol cmon
peters went for the run
peters looks deflated
wow good job peters
regardless who wins both teams gonna be sore tomorrow
we blitzed on 3rd and 4 instead of dropping underneath coverage for out routes

wink martindale idk about him let yannick hunt while you keep the back end covered
wait is burrow hurt
hahahahahahahahahahaa
lol wut
now eat shit
fuck that trickery lol
ha
now thats what i call good karma
lmao they did what we did last week
titans are nervous lol
hahah fuck you
that was so satisfying after last year
damn had his whole hand in his helmet
soon as i say cant let em respond with a drive here they get a 50yd busted coverage bs completion but before i can finish my comment ty titans backup center
did that count as a sack for yannick
i wonder if that little camera buzzing an inch above their heads all the time gets annoying
proche for the first down
more proche
proche sighting at wr
lol vrabel looking like he has a migraine
look at you duvernay catching the ball and not immediately falling down like hollywood does
a proche sighting
souljaaaaaaa
soulja
looks like lj and brown want to have a great chemistry but just dont have it
vabrels looking very stressed out lmao
take that 5 every time
we need to out the screws back in browns foot
feed the rookies
running the exact same play with dez again
dez
brown isnt being very soulja
i wanna see lamar stiff arm the shit outta butler
hollywood sucks man trade him and get us a real wr
proche
soulja down bad rn ngl
hollywood is a complete non factor hes not out there anymore on run plays with 1 wr
dez with more catches than the soulja
easy normal play and lamar and brown cant connect on a simple 5yard out route

im glad we got the 1st regardless but man what is the problem
proche the future i been waiting so long to hype him up
is dez picking on butler as well
im glad dez is getting looks
come on lamar
bad throw
bruh why
not ideal
fuck
god dammit
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
fuck that sucks we got this though keep the energy
i disagree
whyyyy
i dont get it i really dont
fuck simmons
i hate everything
not a great decision by lamar but the play calling has been bad
ravens need to run bruh
thats 100 on duvernay
not a great pass but duvernay gotta play the ball a bit better too
too hight lamar but you still got it we have to take deep shots
those are the kind of throws they need to give dez holy fuck
had a good drive going and that play call was horrible why throw deep when youre trying to run out the clock at least it was an arm punt
kyle boller throwback
the ole punt interception flacco was the master of it
cbs shows look god awful

i want you to love me yeah you can want that all you want good luck with that
honestly tho a lot of lamars deep throws today have been wounded ducks lots of floaters
solid tackle by duvernay tho
that was an absolute shit show of duv you cant even call that a play on the ball haha
is greg roman listening to the broadcast for play calls those two throws back to back out to dez were sus
wolfe unblocked

rg yeeted out of there lmao
no pressure and a conversion
how dare they butcher a fleetwood mac classic
why rush 6 with 2 of them rushing way late thats essentially 4 rushing with 2 out of the play in the backfield
lmao we couldnt just kill clock and kick the fg earlier
visa is my favorite small business
ferguson biting on that bootleg again
they are getting on a roll here
ugh this sucks
why do we always bite on bootlegs rollouts and screens do we teach edge at all
elliot plays with absolutely nothing to lose and i love it
so we concuss henry and now hes running all over us oook
come on stop letting henry cook
cmon we cant lose to henry again
elliot saving a lot of plays out there
williams looking clean
oh fuck hope i wasnt to early to compliment the d line
back to biting nails
regardless of the outcome of this drive we need offense to come back and play cool we were never gonna end the game on this defensive drive need to keep working the clock and ideally get points
why would you kick it there and not go for it

struggling to understand vrabel here
need at least a field go on this next drive just win time of possession and we win the game
i think theyre going to send all theyve got at lamar on this drive
dont worry guys if theyre just gonna keep relying on field goals they wont be able to beat us
just give me a goddamn field goal here at least
break off a massive run pleeeeease
hop on the gus bus roman
dobbin and weavin
we cannot go 3 and out or a turnover this drive absolutely cannot
wait till the clock hits 2 every play
need for snead
when you have the need we have the snead
that is the reason right there why skura isnt a tackle
were getting so fucked right here lmao fuck off
these calls are unbelievably bad
that spot was so bs
of course
i hate our oline man lmfaooo
what the hell
smdh
bad throw
huge stop incoming come on
how many fucking penalties
we need to just switch to mainly screen and yac plays this shit is infuriating to watch
this has a recipe for disaster yikes
give us one more stand on defense
they keep talking about andrews but 66 fired even earlier
55 nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
jesus these injuries
stinks
backed up near their endzone cmon defense carry us yet again
we have big boys but damn they slow
we never play qb spy plays
tannehill has way too much time ngakoue we need you here buddy
they can complete things where each of our passes are painful to see not going to get the ball back this game
peters got beat so hard on that one
how are the titans still in this
this defense looks done
peters wya
just give me lj fort and malik harrison out there i dont understand how queen always seems to be in the wrong spot
sorry but we cant play the refs and the opposing team and hope to win when our team is performing subpar
marcus peters is well done today cooked all day
need a big defensive stop here
board fucking whiffed
defense is shitting themselves lol
fucking garbage ass defenders what the fuck is that
so glad we have marcus peters
here we fucking go again cant wait
so we cant tackle anymore huh
holy fucking shit this team
i see we got burnt toast peters today
why the fuck is board guarding aj brown
wow that was awful tackling
i see weve forgotten how to tackle
my god what are yall doing
tackle plz
lol if only he could hit that easy ass pass
that was a total joke
low effort lazy tackling fucking wow
this defense is trash
lmao were so fucked
we better not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
cmon
i think theyve gotten at least five yards on every play this drive
stiffen the fuck up
i cant with this defense anymore
gonna need one more scoring drive from lamar
the word they forgot was tackle
dobbins carried the offense and made him sitout nearly all the second half got a bad passbad route on a first down throw leading to int then that last joke of a drive not looking forward to see the offense to try and win a game lmao
gonna come down to automatuck
okay judon
we just arent very good few bright spots today but last 20 mins has been pitiful
lets go d
dennis pitta has too much praise for the other team when their offense is clicking hes ravens radio shut up
ive seen this story before they will score go up here and we will come up short
stop the count
bad snap yes i love bad snaps
lets go judon
fucking pathetic tackling
omg pathetic
what in the absolute fuck was that
zero fucking tackling wtf
learn to fucking tackle
fuck me make a fucking tackle fucking fuck
moments like this are judon frustrates me he has moments where hes good but then does dumb stuff the rest of the year
what the fuck ever man
zero heart
embarrassing
unbelievable defense lets us down this time
what the hell was that
what a surprise
what the actual fuck
unfucking real
clark is having the best day
im sorry guys but this is funny like this is were a joke kind of funny
ouch
pussy team
what a fucking joke
wtf
wtf was that
wow
what the fuck
we fucking deserve to lose with this soft ass defense on this drive
where was the tackling there
so thats what yac looks like
these guys arent ravens
im sorry guys everything went to shit once i turned i started watching im gonna change the channel now
hahaha
thats embarrassing
pathetic
were fucked
stop going for the strip and lay the wood
god we need to gang tackle way better
this defense cant stop a nosebleed with the game of the line pathetic
jfc we need to work on defense
fuck me in the ass
we need a clutch td drive
who saw this coming
marlo with an all time horrible tackling attempt
we need a clutch td drive
wow
x200b

okay lamarits time to put on your big boy pants and win this game
who is ready for justice hill
absolutely outcoached
i 100 knew this would happen int and fg next drive killed this game
our offense and tackling have been poor today
i give the defense some slack because of injuries but marcus peters is routinely beat on long routes
those 3rd and long conversions ouch oh well another blow out
injuries got us this year good team but we lost too many heroes
useless
i am in disbelief
weather is clear we can do this
fuck everything
time to make up for the choke on the last drive offense
that felt deliberate on queens part well see if that saved time pays off
snead
3 and out is what im feeling but i hope not
this week on days of our steelers ravens
this is an embarrassment
belee
i had my hopes up
what an inspiring defense

go get some big receivers who can catch please
were talking making deep run when were still fighting for our playoff lives here
honestly its good that the o have this chance

defense played excellent until the fourth after the offense turned the ball over and sucked ass

redemption time
the day after my birthday all i wanted was a win against these arrogant bums and yall play like this
time to crank this shit up another level
is it that hard to grab a players leg and hold on holy shit
lets go offense
lamar prove me wrong please
just no turnovers
dezzzzzz
deeeeezzz
good shit dez
xx
yeah we need 7 here
xxx
so far so good
love it but go out of bounds dez lol
holy shot we can win it here
what a fucking block by dobbins
there you go lamar get in the zone
oh yea were in range
butler with the hard head and the soft ass
heres where it happens backed up by 2 penalties and a bad throw on 4th and goal
lets go dezzzz
if theyre on the field theyre in field goal range for tucker
dez
this whole drive shows why gro has to go if you can pull this drive out of your ass then you shouldnt look like shit most of the game
tucker time baby
at least we have two tos
where yall doubters at now
fuck the refs
damn that llamajax of old
ok this lack of discipline falls on the coach to be honest harbaugh is to blame here
2 timeouts left you can run anything you want here
throw the x
what the fuck these penalties are killer
omfg that was a touchdown
refs are out of breath
omfg that was the game winner god damnr
lets go lamar prove everyone wrong
draw play to jk or quick slants
an their dbs have been playing really well today
should hit andrews man
damn i would go dez 1 on 1
that was a great drive
so much fucking cushion and we cant do shit with it
sus redzone plays again
win the toss
incoming 80 yd rush
lamar go own it
half expected judon to say were kicking it at the coin toss ngl
chuck it to dez you cowards
score a td here and end this shit prove the doubters wrong lj
lets do it cmoooooooon
stunt on these hoes
lamar gamewinning td run im calling it
score a td
dez is has our second most receiving yards today
ok so this drive will define lamar lol but i believe we get the win hopefully hollywood gets us some big plays here
i belee in a thing called dub
fuck
sigh
thats the problem with dobbins
and thats a great start
tuck the ball my man
alright brush it off and get ready to convert
bruh
was that lamar shouting
wow
they only need a field goal to win
shades of flacco sigh
fucking unbeleivable
this team is just so fucking annoying man
l
we are holding them all over the place and still cant block for lamar
perfect meeting my expectations
aaaaaaaand thats ball game
limp fucking dick bullshit
we have not executed on offense well enough at all today outside of dobbins
o line really didnt do their job here thats brutal
good game
that was rough man this defense has not been able to do it
okay defense you have struggled making the absolute must stop plays we needed this year now is the time lets get that turnover
someone make a fucking play pls
bullshit ol completely gave up on 2nd down and that cost us the game most likely
3rd in the north
i must be a glutton for punishment watching this team every week
run on 1st down for no reason check

sack on 2nd down w snead being decleated in his route check

3rd down checkdown going nowhere check

lol
cmon d
lmao wtf was that
the titans are too good to not score here
its okay well be 88 soon
andrews blows this game for us blame one single play it is absolutely the false start idc what else he did this game that is the play that blew it yet again he shits the bed in an important game just found a new way to shit it this time
thats so 2020 ravens
does anyone know the heimlich maneuver someone needs to save baltimore from choking
coaching usually wins in ot
this team just leaves you so empty
get peters out of the fucking game holy shit
any receivers coming out of college you guys like this year lol seriously though
terrible tackling
and of course we cant tackle
this is fucking depressing

our offense is the same story every week defense is banged up and can only do so much fuck this season
just learn to tackle
look at all these bootlegs we dont ever do
god im jealous of the wrs the titans have
pretty sure defense is cooked
im killing our defensive backs bro they are such ass today
why are we playing so far back
c a n n o t t a c k l e
time to fake the injuries to avoid the embarrassment
welp we should get better next year
great contain and then he cuts inside lol what the fuck
i just dont see it right now
2 fucking games in a row the oline cost us man what the fuck
games over
this game is done man d is gassed
i cant believe we are gonna choke this game away so many chances so mentally weak
cmon d
welp
it always feels like we struggle to throw the ball up the field yet every team we play always has guys wide open and they move the ball with ease
this is just so easy for them we fucking suck so much
im over this season man
so hurt right now cant do this
field goal range for gost now up by 11 and ran the fucking ball twice
our dbs are just there to tackle after the receivers caught the ball
unless gostowski misses this game is over this team does not deserve to make the playoffs
yeah ggs
we are trash
how tf do you get no pressure with that many people rushing
well this is shitty
its literally pitch and catch too fuckin easy
everyone we absolutely need a stop from the defense this year we just have not got it
goodbye
making aj brown look like fucking julio
lol we suck
wow
lol fuck me
well that sucks
embarrassing make changes
we are pathetic out toughed outlasted
game is probably over at this point

if the ravens lose im calling their season tbh
thats so raven
lol oline holds falling down nothing
fuck the titans
my god we need campbell and williams back asap and we need to draft exclusively wr and oline fuck this man
winnable game left out on the field yet again
what really pisses me off is that they get our hopes up like were going to win and then they pull this
fuck everything
fuck this
pain
rip
when tony romo the announcer knows all your def plays how can you not lose
sucks that our schedule is so easy to end we might luck into playoffs
draft 3 wrs and 4 o linemen i dont give a fuck
and pittsburgh is next how fun
the browns are better than us right now what a fucking joke

gotta go after corey davis in the off season
fuck tony romo idk how anyone likes him as a ravens fan five games with him now and hes such a fucking prick
lamar has to win this or else his reputation is etched in stone
popped into this thread two possessions into this game and see people are saying were gonna miss the playoffs and go 88 and remembered why i dont come in here during games my god
this is becoming a coaching problem i love harbs but holy shit man
outcoached and outplayed once again
i dont wish injury on no one but fuck the titans they want to dance on our logo thats karma
our d carried us to 61 our offense is so shit
idk what is happening hollywood never dropped passes in college or last year what did this team do to him like wtf actually happened why does it seem like we shatter every wrs confidence same shit happened with perriman
fire fucking greg roman hes ruining the team
duv has to fight for that
more points off of a lj turnover
lamar has been so so bad this game play calling suspect per usual but hes way off
this season has been nothing short of a disaster
patrick queen has not played that well this season
judons biggest play of the game
3rd place coming up
tear it all down this team is nothing
coaching has been abysmal today harbaugh is having a really bad year coaching wise fuck anyone who downvotes this its true hes been bad this year
oh look an offensive line penalty fuck this offensive line these backup guys can all go next season absolutely zero discipline
why do refs call us different than every other team top of the league in every penalty category in a year where refs arent calling other teams for holding
i for one am not surprised at all weve sucked in every single game except one
overreactions in 321
the butthole is gaping
derrick henry has some doodoo on his back
its like we have no pride anymore you would think that trash talk at the beginning of the game would have us fired up
we bout to get spanked boys
our lbs are trash
next time ingram breaks one for a 35 yard td i better not see any of you cheering for him
we have some pretty mediocre souljas
ingrams tank is on empty hes not producing anymore
i made the mistake of saying queen cant cover well to a know it all
15 messages later i guess im in the wrong
we just have zero attitude
bro thats a pick six if thats mp and not marlo
good fucking shit
yes a good play
lamar is completely panicked out there
everyone is saying roman but that right there was lamar dez was wide open
i understand the play calling has been no good but lamar is panicking in the pocket getting faked by phantom pressure and making poor decisions every game there is plenty of blame to go around and lets make sure it goes all the way around
blah blah blah blame roman for everything blah blah blah
ricard making my d hard with that effort
bailing tennessee out with stupid penalties we can beat them and should beat them
the titans really talked all that trash just to drop these passes lmao
id love to pair yannick with a real edge rusher and not some fat fuck who argued with fans on twitter judon
not even trying to pass here sad
i was really hoping this would be a shootout
we need points points points
damn bro i hope henrys ok
henry just got his bell rung hes going concussion protocol out at least this quarter probably the game
awful throw
lamar come on we dont need to take deep shots
greg roman thinks this is madden
lamars mechanics were shit in that throw and the pass suffered
roman literally cant just call a strait forward game he always gets too cute
why is a deep pass even an option why our run game is so strong and were up one possession
this sub kept saying involve duvernay
fuck how is our 3rd down defence so bad
feeling bad about all the injuries
lmfao this shit is so scripted i knew it most important drive we choke
that 3rd down call was so bad by the titans im starting to think about this being scripted
i start hollywood in fantasy every week just waiting for a breakout game
god damnit lamar
i swear if we choke this away
buckle up boys they score a td and well get to showcase our incompetent never able to come from being offense
marcus peters getting burned
embarrassing defense
thats what a receiver looks like hollywood
peters queen lamar blame of the game holy fucking shit
no playoffs this year
looooooooooooool
this wouldnt have happened if lamar was accurate on 3rd down
1st quarter bandwagon fans checking in to give again
live by the punchout die by the punchout
mental fortitude of this years team is lacking
i counted at least 2 holdings but ok
woah we won the toss lets just call it there
fucking judon finally doing something positive
i dont trust this soft ass defense in ot at all
what was that greg roman playcall
oh well
gg
i cant believe we drafted marquise brown will never call him hollywood over aj brown dk metcaf
lol marcus peters is such a little bitch
this is by far the most overrated secondary in the fucking league yes they can get picks occasionally you know whats more important consistently tackling and not getting burnt like a motherfucker once a drive
sure why not

blow it up this team is garbage
this season is at best a wildcard 7 seed loss
looking like its time to take off the jersey
fuck this sorry ass team this season is over and anyone who thinks otherwise is a delusional fan boy

we are not making the playoffs and we dont deserve to either
thats game fuck this why do i get up at 5am every week can someone remind me not to do this again i hate how weak we are
well thats the season
season over
thats our ravens yall
any single player or coach who says we like where we are after this game should be cutfired
im so sick of this team this season
4 and out incoming
bad throw by lamar
someone here mentioned romo always saying good things about lamar i havent heard him say one thing this game without taking the titans wang out of his mouth
that throw was awful lamar getting more excuses
we really gotta get another td cuz they could still win this never forget how dumb roman is
ive never found colbert funny i dont really see his appeal
lamar could hand the ball to the other team for a turnover and this sub would still find a way to give him an excuse
we might actually miss the playoffs very real possibility we are 65 after next week
remember when this offense was fun to watch
guys everyone is hurt they cant do anything they did last year face it this defense is average at best right now not surprising that the titans are driving down the field
sooo lamar gonna have to win this game with his arm on to pittsburgh i guess
oh well guess well try again next year
how can you be mad at the defense when a ticky tacky pi call gives the titans 30 yards fucking bullshit
lol i would certainly hope our 1st round selection could put pressure on a qb when hes called to blitz and goes unblocked
you guys are hilarious blaming roman for that one dez was open
tony romo isnt on his a game today
anyone know the context on that black dude losing his shit in the interview on this cbs ad
how was that a penalty
all on lamar he had all of the time in the world right there
were up by 8drive is going our way lets just heave the ball up instead of giving it to dobbins and run some clock but no fuck it we like to screw our momentum
this is an attempt at a flag theyre not kicking

edit bad coaching henry gets that 1st down
im getting pretty concerned about lamars ability to throw for every good throw theres 5 like that
so sick of this team i cant seriously enjoy any player since 2012 every one is a hype douche even the ones that are good like humph all fucking talk and no bite in big games
tucker is once again the only good thing about this sorry ass team been one hell of a super bowl hang over
grats its over
gg hope we miss the playoffs for a higher draft pick
lamar isnt accurate
this thread is so full of s
how does mark not make that catch for fucks sake make a difficult catch for once in your life man
we are also dealing with major injuries on both sides of the ball so im not really sure what some of you all expect it sure as hell was never going to be easy
lamar needs to get out of his own fucking head get the ball out to the open receiver and let them do their work
why the shit are we throwing the ball
we had momentum and lamar threw a fucking deep ball on first down
chill we r 2 possesions into the game
well be lucky to make it in as a wildcard
malikqueen i will tolerate no slander
where the fuck are the queens a bust jackasses right now fucking clowns
fuck andrews for not catching that making lamar look bad and shit




am i doing this right rravens
welp overtime is a loss everyone knows this henry is a late game monster
big game for us today we are better then what our record shows

also this is for any steeler fans lurking youve played 3 winning teams all year and another tough matchup today for you all
im not feeling too confident today guys but im with this team until the end
refs are fucking us since harbaugh took off mask fuck all refs
letting them easily convert 3rd and 11 smdh
no pursuit no tackling no hustle no awareness and no physicality you really do get the total package with queen
easy peasy
just relax and set your expectations low however low your expectations might currently be lower them a bit further this game is probably going to be awful to watch for us
turrible
football is chess and we are marion tinsley
can we just call the season get our guys back healthy and give it another shot next year
ight imma head out
lol please correct this are you really about to get beat down by this team again
holy fuck the outside was completely open
lamar dropping too deep again gives a better angle to the de
i swear in this thread drivetodrive we either should give it to gus more or dobbins more were either gonna miss the playoffs on one drive then well be fine the next this thread is exhausting
this just in banged up oline and dline are playing poorly


more at 11 we discuss how scientists have discovered that water is in fact wet
play dez you cowards
justice hill more like justice hit

ill see myself out
thats gap commercial is pretty dumb
no flagthought for sure late qb hit flag was coming
romo is garbage ever since he got his new deal
was it harrison or queen that hit him i thought it was harrison but everyone is saying queen
offence is done we dont deserve the playoffs they deserve to sit home pissed off gr got to go what is he thinking put the fucking ball in the end zone
dez wide open on that slant and lamar pumps while looking at him you have to make that throw brother
we have to score a damn td marlon is getting torched by aj brown and its going to lead to more points
fucking hell lamar
i really hope we get boldin out of dez we need it so bad idk if theres just 0 trust there or no plays being called his way
let jt kick it dont get cute imo
outcoached
just throw screens on us all game cant defend them for shit
why the fuck are you running it my fucking god might as well just send lamar out there with training wheels
damn i hope hes ok
looks like something could be broke i hope jayon is fine
i wish i could mute tony romo
please god please get a touchdown herei know it wont happen but holy shit that would be huge
where are the people who thought the refs were apart of a conspiracy against the ravens lol
fuck butler
hope henry is ok hes a beast i like the intensity though
gost you better miss you cunt
people are calling us dirty wtf
why are we not running ahead
hubris
lamar wtf was that shit
no need for the deep shots just win time of possession
can mcdonalds bring their fucking all day breakfast back

i mean shit
this team that drive couldve essentially been game
and just as i started to praise lamas second half self

edit i actually did pin that one on duvernay cant give up on a pass like that when youre in front of a defender
god why couldnt it be like this last year when we were even better too
great catch damn
nobody goes to a car dealership wanting to buy an acura
queen just be running around not doing shit not tackling not communicating just out there running around getting paid millions
terrible fucking throw
every drive a gift of points for the titans im fucking tired
i think we need to accept that our offense is not going to turn the corner this season
i think when it comes to deep passes lamar i just a lil too late releasing the ball
boy you can just feel it
this team looks done
good news after they score the td on this drive we have enough time to watch greg and lamar not drive back for the win
can we please stop blitzing
so was lamar just a flash in the pan or something
spend all this money on defense just for this bullshit to happen
are you fucking kidding me
did i just see a shorter person or was that regular height but in comparison to these beast players
oh what a fucking joke this team is
lol they had every right to dance on our logo were a fucking embarrassment
gg zero faith in this team no mental toughness and it doesnt help with us playing the refs too
we deserve to lose this game holy shit wtf
i dont care if its unpopular fire all the coaches we cant close out big games and its been an issue for years
losing today puts us at 3rd in the division this is the season
istg if roman insists on more deep passingim gonna lose it
question how many 4th quarter comeback victories does lamar have
cant think of any maybe at pitt last year
i hate our clock management skills lol
fucking sad
win the toss
think we lose the game if we dont win the toss in ot defence is gassed and titans have the momentum hope i am wrong
cheers to everyone who said we lost after the titans scored and to the dude who said 4 and out when we got the ball

ot win coming up
that fucking int is the only reason were going to ot fuck roman
that last play was a pathetic play call design better pass plays
the comments in here are so negative right now it makes me sad the ravens obviously have their issues but get it together people belee
damn surprised we took the ball there offense hasnt been good is coming off of a tiring 2 min drive
a fucking screen really
what is gary kubiak doing nowadays
what was that we deserve the loss after that series
being a ravens fan isnt as much fun this year as i thought itd be
d playing like the game is already over
fucking pathetic this team sucks dick
fucking choke
115 record 1st round exit
everyone was right we were wrong this team is a fraud blow it up
this is gonna open up serious discussions about lamars contract
this sub needs to chill yall so reactional
what the hell happened to this team its like we completely imploded
why are we looked at as such a good team i havent seen anything redeeming this season except our ability to force turnovers
bandwagon fans jumping ship already
fire roman after this game there is nothing to say after this game
thats a penalty wtf lol
that was a nice play call great defence tbf
so were turning on our rookie linebacker today
one thing ive noticed about lamar is he tries to do too much look how much energy hes wasted already running around scrambling and throwing incomplete passes
no discipline on this team its astonishing
that might be game smh
lamars being outplayed by tannehil
lmaoo this team deserves to get fucked
sadly i just have no hope this game was a real bummer
we are so lucky that wasnt picked
ive always wondered why coaches hang onto players when contracts arent guaranteed in the nfl especially when those players are playing at below replacement level all this to say cutmarquisebrown
this sub is so toxic
bunch of cry baby fucking pansies in these comments remember the last time we got a sb we came through the wild card round
lol henry gonna break the single game rushing record
some basketball ball players have the nerve to say football is soft smh
wtf kind of penalty did we just get this is bs

so are we not allowed to tackle now
lamar both 1 is incapable of throwing deep and 2 is incapable of throwing outside the numbers
the oline sucks ingram sucks lamar is having a sophomore slump i guess roman sucks hollywood is disappointing smh
was this team really just a flash in the pan we still have a slim chance at the end here but moving forward i dont see much in store for this team
anyone who was a fan before last year knows this is more par for the course calm down we aint going 142 every season have we looked good recently no but thats how it was during the flacco era we will be fine
a lot of sus fans in here time to eject lmao
here come the fake fans
this team is so undisciplined its ridiculous
lamars fault 6 people couldnt tackle
ill say it again fuck marcus peters
i wouldnt even be surprised if we miss the playoffs this team is such a joke this year
that fucking int killed our game change my mind
henry gets stopped today
do we trade up to get pitts from florida in the draft next year
stunt on these hoes lol
ward must be in the doghouse to still be inactive
nfl 360 about mo this week

im not tryna cry on a tuesday night nfl network
can somebody tell me a radio station to listen to the game on i am not from baltimore so i dont know the local stations and am using a radio app to listen while i travel today
thinking we get a win today still think henry will go off on us
i wanna see alot of gus today
demeatrice jr wants retribution
romo has more confidence in greg roman than i do lol
hulu live has the steelers and eagles games on is there anywhere online i can watch
no instant start today
ok i need a stream and apparently rnflstreams is no more can someone help me out
feeling hopeful today lets eat this dub
fuck live in montgomery county and theyre showing the fucking skins game on cbs and eagles on fox
im watching a stream cuz fuck nova can someone say when the kick off happens so i know how far behind i am
wtf why
thank god we got jim nantz as the commentator lol
is this commercial part of the cbs intro because i see it every time
im kinda of glad that this game isnt on in my area and i can only watch it through redzone
here we go
lmao fuck malcolm butler dude is only relevant because of one play
what was that skirmish
nice fucking return
great return lets gooooo set the tone
thats my boy
got away with one again
nice duv
dammit
wait he didnt catch it
of course dez gets a catch then that happens
well at least they actually threw it to dez cant complain about that
fluker unfortunately has to be our best option at rt but i cant see why dudes been rough
awful punt lmao
thats a great start
shit
lets go 1 drive 1 penalty
greeeeaaaatttt
christ
lmaooo
already with the penalties
hump was holding the fuck out of him

lets put in ben powers over fluker
first game of the season not on tv in my local market so i am only catching plays here and there on red zone channel when they show us i know it wouldve been called back for a hold anyway but it looked like dez caught that 3rd down pass to me why did they rule it incomplete
fingertips man
lol we getting fucked
again awful playcalling by roman and bad oline play
hump is such a fucking idiot on this play
awesome
that is gonna happen all game i feel
let us pray
and of course followed by a dpi
theyre scared of henry and titans called a perfect play for ut
nice backtoback penalties team really understood that message
funny the day after humphrey says pi should be a 15 yard penalty he gets a 50 yard one
welp gonna be this type of game was a a good pi call but god damnit i hate the titans
that was holding not pi
bullshit
fuck sake marlo
fuck man
sigh washington vs bengals here in nova
when will dez jerseys be available black dez jersey would be

how am i already so mad after 3 minutes of game time
you can see his jersey right humphrey
elliot has been getting exposed lately smh
got it right that time
deshon tackle please
henry is sweet when he doesnt build up speed hes not built to truck people
i was so excited to watch the game but theyre showing the washington game instead
number 71 is huge
this team man
this is fucking retarded
fill in the blank

fire
maybe they need to be embarrassed to wake up
theyre converting too easily
this defense is so fucking soft
quick screens and out routes jeep blowing us up
queen already blowing coverages lol
get queen off the field
the most tight ends among all tight ends with 6 jim nantz
why do we refuse to cover in man
that forts man
im tired of our blitzing d getting picked apart by good coaches like when can we stop blitzing its both of our cos
we are not very good
welp this is going to be a long day
oh well
well that was easy
right down our throats
yeah this is going to be rough lol
fuck
already started drinking got long island iced teas and jameson on deck
offense was just too hype because of the pregame bullshit well get a tub here
so can we take a deep shot now seems every deep shot gets a pi call
let them dance on your logo at midfield and then come out and play like a bunch of bitches lol
how many times are we going to give up critical yards on a chip blockleak twice on that drive they got an open receiver off a chip block not good
well the one good thing about the opening drive was the dez appearance and thats about it so far
even with all thats wrong we got 3 and a half quarters to go i have faith that we will turn it around
sadly we all know if the offense cant score 7 here it may be a long day
that was too easy
lets go lamar
cowboys fan here can someone link me the dez target by chance thankssss
how can i watch this if it isnt in my coverage zone
strong right and couldnt get a yard
give the fucking ball to edwards and stop fucking around
draft linemen
oh my fucking god man
mmm ricard at te instead of andrews i wonder what we will do
so fucking predictable
we csnt get a yard with 6 linemen spread it out yo
hollywood cant catch now
ravens and 1st round wrs
hollywood
soulja spotting
just attempt to chuck it down the field one time please even if its incomplete you gotta take a fucking shot
at least andrews knows how to be a soulja
old faithful
why the fuck are we going to let the best rb on the team just ride the bench
ingram and hollywood need to be off the field
that run on first down
lol hollywood
yeah just throw it to dez at this point
in mandrews we trust
jfc play dobbins the whole game
stop giving the ball to ingram you fat fuck
i like using the extra ol especially if teams are lining up light and fast against us fuckin run em over
when you give the ball to dobb good things tends to happen
if we cant get movement on the line with 6 lineman than spread out and let it go
hollywood is a fucking bum
dobbins is so much better than ingram this year
just use dobbins and gus
andrews blocking has been nice
a flag against our opponent has hell frozen over
a penalty thats good for us
dobbins should clearly at least be playing more than ingram maybe even gus
i hate saying this because hes an amazing teammate but we need to see ingram less hes still not 100 idk if its age or a nagging injury but gus and dobbins are so much more dynamic right now
dammit
disgusted
well that was unfortunate
almost
defense holds them to 3 on the next drive
cant let them go up 11 gotta hold to a fg
bench dj fluke bro fuck
offensive efficiency and finishing in the red zone is the key to beating the titans just like it was last year
great play justice
fuck that bitch up omg
henry fucking movingly grown as fatties lol
god damn henry is scary
comeon wink dial it up
7 ypc type beat
nice play 40
forced to listen to the game on the radio nice to hear gerry
has the defense ever been this inconsistent when ray and ed were here or was it consistent
bowserpower
needed that big time
sorry ryan your receiver is in another castle
that a way d way to unload on tannehill
hump didnt even attempt to intercept that
patrick queen in the clutch
good shit defense
fuck yeahhhh
beautiful lb play right there
cmon offense take advantage
lightning mcqueen
kachow
great design right there even better execution letttsss gooooo
the guys name is freaking bowser
where are the queen haters at now
bowsers got some wheels
bigtime fucking play lets go
i love mark but jk and gus are the ones
okay actually great read by lamar hes been keeping those way too often this year
lets put it to rest queen is a solid player with tons of potential and also has plenty to improve upon hes a rookie playing lb tobbe expected
dobbins looking slick
enough of ingram give jk the ball
marquise has got to go bitching about targets and he never fights for balls never gets open and drops easy passes all mouth and no skill
o line is on a short leash do your job or youre out love it
dobbins is mad he keeps getting taken out and he has more than a right to be
x200b

are we really going to settle for a field goal again
dobbins is the future
romo exposed
why is ingram seeing the field if jk is running like this
wtf
more jk edwards less ingram
dude jk is a beast
dobbins been that dude
feed dobbins
stop wasting these downs man this is so dumb
feed dobby more
dobbins is amazing that vision agility is crazy
lol good thing drafted him
dobbins rb1 from now on
dobbins a baller
dobbins is good
dobbins is special
fluker has got to be expendable at this pint this guy cant hold water anywhere on the line
this is the best we got
wtf was that
wtf was that
another fg hahahaha
dear baltimore please win this game

love indy
cmon man this is just ridiculous
man if we get stuffed in the red zone again
where is dez
beating ourselves again
i love ingrams fire and personality but this team is objectively better with gus jk
dont
back to back bad play calls
dobbins been running for 10 yards a carry better pull him when we are 1st and goal
so glad we took jk out to complete waste that down fuck off roman
embarrassing
when simmons isnt spitting in peoples faces hes twisting ankles scumbag
why the fuck do we have 3 players on the right sideline of the endzone lmao
why do shoot ourselves in the foot every drive stop the cute shit
fucking need 7 please for the love of god
how does greg roman let this shit happen every fucking week and keep his job
what a dumb play
god our o line is trash
come on man
dear lord thats pathetic
fucking waste
what a joke
this is so fucking frustrating
fuck this
disaster
run
lol we suck
we need serious help at o line and greg romans playcalling has been ill say not impressive to me this year
jesus fuck
what does lamars contract look like
awful awful awful
defense got us in position offense moved the ball 1 yard new identity looks great
we cant even execute a run properly
those first 2 plays killed us
opdivo sounds good except for the 437 side effects
special teams showing up today
big boy no little boy
lets go hill
justice nice
are special teams is an absolute unit designed short kicks off and great gunning down field to hold them on the 20 every time
this team is done until the coaches leave
our defense is our only hope this season
good stout run defense
great job d cmon o pull your head out roman
lets go o
what active raven would be the best mma fighter assuming they trained that growing up instead of football
so with dez elevated im pretty sure we gotta sign him to active roster now can we confirm that
defense stepping up big time offense needs to follow suit
now its time for lamar to lock in
feed jk
dobbins playing with fire
woah lamar just went under center
two good runs by dobbins time to put ingram back in
let jk cook
only let dobbins run
i fucking love dobbins start this mf
jk
give jk the fucking ball
feed jk
its the dobbin show
yes dobbins again and again and again
who the fuck is holden
strap a rocket to dobbins plz
dobbins is a fucking beast roman better keep him in
plz for the love of god let dobbins run stop taking him out
dobbins gonna be a choncccy boi cuz all he does is eats
no ingram fuck
that was a good throw just good coverage
i dont expect anything with deep shots
dez again
had too much air on it
someone give dobbins an article of clothing so he can be a free elf
ball got to get out quicker lj
bad throw by lamar
lamar really struggling with deep ball
will falsestarten
he has to slow down so much
holden wtf
again dez was open and in position to at least get a 1st down
need more timing pass plays lamar seems to be better at those throws
who the fuck is holden
good throw
we didnt have enough field space to get that if we were a bit further back that couldve been a td
dez was open again
there we go
not souljas fault there lamar needs to stop hesitating
dude fuck brown for being a bitch dez was wide open again
hollywood is too short
thank god
brown saving the effort for
theres our soulja again
hollywood got to come back and try compete for that why cant he beat anyone
3 receivers next to eachother
very poor pass concept
bruh wow
if hollywood attacks that ball its a td instead he tried to let it come to him
why was snead right next to andrews what shit planning by roman
wow a taller receiver catches a ball in traffic who wouldve thought
damn lamar throws that sooner thats a td
hell of a throw hell of a defensive play
lamar with no fucking touch or accuracy on his deep passes again
that was va crazy catch
dobbins is ass pounding them
lmao at the people shitting on hollywood for not catching an under thrown pass
td boyss
go go go
fuck it just chuck it to andrews and dez the entire game ez win
ricard might be short but idk
touchdown ravens
fuck yeah ricard
he makes those throws and its just so sweet let the kid do his thing and stop being cute you feckless fuck roman
4 handoffs to dobbins let see it
hell yea pat
lets fucking go
yessssssssssss
he was down
ah hes down
ugh god dammit i thought we had that
lol phrasing tony phrasing
there you go guys finally
his knee is down at like the one

i called this play needed to happen more my buddy said it wouldnt he can suck on it
he was down at the 1 sadly

dobbins fuck yes
all day mfucking jk
there you go jk

defense please keep up the good work
thats ravens football
i guess i know which jersey im getting next
come on boys
you love to see it you did it greg good job
ayyy fuck da titans
dobbins is a goddamn beast
did they overturn it
wanted ricard to get that carry so bad but good shit regardless
lets review the review
has luke willson always had long hair i dont remember seeing that when he was on the seahawks
how do we feel about going for 2
what play to we call for the 2 point
jk muthafucking dobbins
its dobbins szn my dudes
good play call roman really wants to keep his job
no robby the dobby
did harbs says tell gro its dobbins time or do we think he came up with that on his own
dobbins should be getting oroy hype
i love me some jk
feed dobbins
dobbins octopus lets go
loving dobbins today
were home
d o b b i n s coming out party
step up d dobbins did his part
jk in his name stands for mvp you cant tell me any different
aight defense lets stop them here cause they get the ball back after the half
time for the d to step up again lets start putting them behind then run away all their comeback time
lmao we keep blowing up this kick returner
lamar tha big wodie and jk tha coyote
and they want to take him out the game
lets go d get us the ball back
lol juke
jk dobbins is my new father
jesus get ferguson a fucking map
holy shit what an embarrassment by ferguson on that play lmao
aaaaaaand here we go again
come on ffs dont let fucking guy rip off a run
lamar tannehill
some say that ferguson is still chasing henry
this man chris board makes doing absolutely nothing all game look so hard
that misdirect was painfully effective
lightning mcdobbins in the race
ouch
wonder if queen plays with his helmet loose i know thats how i always liked to wear my helmet even though i knew it was dangerous it was comfortable that way
im really glad the nfl doesnt watch people to watch their games without having to jump through hoops and give up credit card information
these play actions are going to hurt us real soon
horrible throw dude was completely open
tannehill missed that play but why was that wideout so open
a stop would be huge here
can we start running man when they have 2 routes downfield we can double up and play better defense
lucky break there
patrick queen fuck
is it time to end the rb by committee and just name dobbins the starter
good shit good pressure
lets fucking go
didnt they just pay tannehil a bunch
defense playing well
ravens been bailed out twice by bad throws
the longest rush of the game didnt come from henry lamar dobbins the bus or ingram it came from tannehill after he juked a defender

ill let you read that again
d stepping tf up
um i think marlon was out of position there
wow
come on man
bro levine youre a db come on
well
could have called us for nzi on that one lucky
sigh
bad
damn so close to a pick
fuck
thats why levine doesnt play defense
get a sack here for me
i thought it was funny that they were walking off in no mans land should have knew better
stopppp
so so costly
we will dk anything to let them score wont we
thats literally a hit on his stomach wtf
fucking bullshit thats a garbage call i get its the rules but its pussy as fuck to call that roughing the passer
bbbbbut tannehil is really good and he would be insane without a good run game dude for real hes a great qb we could win throwing the ball if we had to but we just dont have to
that is a crap call thigh level
where can you hit a qb
thats so ravens
jesus fucking christ
this feels like the steelers game were really trying hard to give it away
why is nobody ever there on these stupid little screen plays linebacker on the flats
anyone else watching this game on mute
im happy were being aggressive with the tos here
boom
wow wolfe hit henry pretty good there
i cant remember more extended drives by our opponents maybe 2014
a special teams coordinator needs to recognize these things thats literally like their only job
okay lets see if lamar can push it down the field without an int if we get the ball back
huge get this stop and we have time for a drive
cant believe no one tried to recover the ball
incomplete pass
big fucking stop by the squad
harbaugh should tell the refs they look nice in two weeks maybe thatll change their attitude towards us it wont matter if he does it or not next week
no roughing the kicker call there we got off lucky
ngakoue i heard that name like 3 weeks ago in the trade window
yannic is a beast
damn i wanna see yannick get a sack badly every time hes literally right there
this feels good
lets drive and get that 3 points back
uh oh
too bad the masters wasnt this week so we would be spared nantz drivel
who gets ball at half
that guy is writhing in pain
poor dude
our passing game has been non existent again
omg that looked bad
god damn ben
i cant stop cringing at the slowmo of that guys arm going backwards
both qbs have terrible stat lines right now
lmao baker
this is my first time watching the james harrison commercial from fanduel not gonna lie it got a laugh out of me
tennessee has another 14 points in them at least need a strong showing from the offense this half
im glad to see some noticeable pressure from the d line itself it almost seemed nonexistent lately
tracy looks beat up
lowkey nervous henry going to go off
no im not gonna talk shit anymore this is the team we have and im gonna root for them no matter what im gonna accept the mistakes and weaknesses and cheer for the success lets go boys its time for some fucking football
judon rocked this dude

lets go
good shit defense
nice opening drive stop
thats how we come out of half here we go
why do teams always run screens over us like it isnt even always effective look at washington and indianapolis games for example
great job d lets go o
ayeeee
i agree with romo they are completely disrespecting dez
thats cool for dez guys dont make comebacks with that big a layoff
look at this dude
hit him right in the head no call hes a defensless receiver there
powned haha
why is orlandos nickname not apollo or ares
dobbins all day
titians are loosing composure
jk take over
huehuehuehue
oh shit defense
he fucking launched that thing
dammn getting some calls today ok ok
both hands on the helmet lmao cmon
that penalty looking like a prom picture pose
a very slow tackle
romo just stop

dobby really
about fucking time we got flags
new york called down during half time and said the fix is too obvious even it out
gimme those holding calllllsssss
unrelated but did anyone see orlando wearing the fucking uggs earlier today
romo needs to fuck off
who the fuck is 82
feels nice to get some free yards
the titans forget we won our first sb in part thanks to them lol
need 7 here
booya
theyre playing 1012yds off of dez throw it to him quick slant
king is fucking trash he cant cover andrews so he tackles him keep him in there

big balls hahahaha mandrews
ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
where the fuck would we be right now without mark andrews
absolute dime
11point lead lets fucking go 2 score game
wooooo
i said earlier this week to beat this team we have to hit them over the top mix that with some great runs and the ravens get back on track
throw him open baby
wow what a throw and play need more of that this season
fuck yeqh
truss
need us to keep building on this week
burrow down burrow down

joker szn
wink martindale has done an excellent job at adjusting to all the injuries all the bullshit the defense went through seriously sign this guy to be the highest paid dc in the league he deserves it
my god that man has a family
hopefully hes okay we hate the guy but id hate to see him injured even more
omg dude
fuck that thats a fumble what a hit
congrats to aj brown for actually catching a pass
fuuuuuuuck
wtf was our defense there
cmon man
shit
goddamnit
lest keep rushing 45 until it doesnt work
pulled a greg roman

wide open we need to draft linemen for both sides and corners unfortunately we have to rely on free agents for wrs
the shoe is on the other foot lol
lmao sucks to suck
jajajajjjajjajja
lmfao
hahahaha wtf was that
douglas skura
oof
that henry hit was savage and exactly what we needed

hope hes ok tho

james is a proche
fuck dean pees
feed dez
brown needs to catch these
hollywood about to throw a fit like his cousin
dez would have caught that
yes get our rookie wrs involved more please
run the same play with dez a third time
damn theres guys on tennessee that look like they dont want to play anymore in their careers let alone this game
imagine that you get receivers who arent afraid of contact and good shit happens
x
he got it anyway
i think he got it
clearly a first down
god fucking dammit

the titans need to be reminded all this trash talk brought them within 1 yard of the super bowl win never works out in the end
yikes
oh boy here we go
quack quack
pees ptsd
jesus
fuck man
ugh
bruh
but why
solid toss
god damn it
i wish lamar used his legs on that one
dude in this commercial with the orange beanie looks like trevor wallaces parody of soundcloud rappers
we need to take shots it clears out the box to all the naysayers in this thread
oof
wwhhhhyyyyyyy
that end of the first half not going for 3 really sucks now
brainless shit just run the fucking ball jesus christ

turning it over with the lead same shit that cost us against pittsburgh we need to stop outthinking ourselves
feelsbadman
come on defense bail us out
on first down
can someone please tell roman the phrase if it aint broke dont fix it he always changed his playcalling mid game for no fucking reason
that was a duck and duv didnt help either bad effort all around
lamar taketh lamar giveth away
we need to hold them this is an extremely important drive if we force a punt and take it into 4q we can control clock and play for fgs
overslept hows the game is look
really worried about this drive its the most important in this game we have to hold them they cant get any poits here
i think they got the wrong michael thomas
pain
here we go
fucking come on
is that a joker or a fuckin dog out there

good drive
mekaris been solid today though
inhales screeaaaamsss internally
dont throw
dobbins has the touchdown there
smh mekari
great drive so far keep it going
tuck plz
fuck if he couldve got it to snead i think he had him but very little separation
can we trade for king hes what we sorely need on defense
my heart rate is through the roof
our centers have been trash this season
dez was in single coverage and db was not close lamar never looked his way
still pissed this went to ot we got dobbins and we cant push for a 3rd and one we had two timeouts
get the ball first in ot cant have that tackling again
we need the ball

well st least dc fans get it on tv now
im feeling the energy
lamar needs to put this game on the offense and win this play like a real leader
here we fucking go man
fucking
first sack wack
and now this
big brain move
look im sorry but roman should be chewed out for our last two plays in regulation alone we have exactly zero money plays that can pick up like 5 yards when we have the reigning mvp who is super fucking dynamic
our ol has been pretty good so far expect for that play

run the ball man fuck

getting stuffed like that by a scrub defense that runs their mouths is painful
secondary is non existent
tackle please
judson just watching
fucking come on
turnover or game
omg
were not getting far in the playoffs with this offensive line it was already a problem but the stanley and phillips injuries sunk us
wide fucking open
honestly blame of the game today is everyone but dobbins everyone has had at least one moment they could have done more and changed this outcome
stop blitzing holy shit
gotskowskis gotta choke here
lets go defense
gameover
our offense fucking blows
humphrey also having his worst game of the season now
gg boys see yall next week
pathetic
how many out routes are you gonna give them holy shit
thats likely the game
game
thought we had good corners wth
how has our secondary looked good at times this season this is insanity
how are they still leaving them so open
playing so fucking far off team is a joke
fuck
omg
lol
lol
fuck this team to pieces
fucking hell
lol
fuck
holy cow what a way to collapse
and thats game
cool
game over
unbelieveable
fitting
i really hate overtime
how much money is invested in this defense

god i hope this team doesnt enter no mans land 20132017 were fucking brutal save for the 2014 season
i wish the ravens knew what it meant to be clutch we lose these games 9 out of 10 times its maddening to not be the clutch team been that way for a while probably since 2014 smh
jk all day long
number not called on any
critical plays lose
behind the browns in the division now lmao
fire harb
thats blatant fucking pi wtf
this game is still not the end of the world my god were still so spoiled here
all good boys we can drop these next two just need a little help lets go ravens good game
removed
meanwhile golden joe in cincinnati just got pulled out on the cart with a knee injury
lamar ends a solid drive with a deep int

checks off the box
this whole fanbase needs to demand real change enough of these shit players and coordinators

this shit is a fucking disgrace to our franchise
marcus peters is looking like a bad extension
patrick queen has regressed horriblyhopefully its just the rookie wall or something
why is lamar so scared everytime he throws the ball stop hesitating just fucking throw it
honestly id rather lose to the steelers than the titans fuck them
im by no means a pro but i will personally give humphrey and peters tackling lessons
our receivers are a fucking joke duvernay was 100 at fault for that int i havent seen that bad of an effort playing the ball since raheem fucking moore in 2012
lamar has all day to throw and he chucks it to a well covered duvernay doesnt matter if dd ran a bad route or the playcall was shit it was on lamar this sub needs to realize a lot of our passing game issues fall on him
the offense is pure cancer and lamar is seeing ghosts now
man i like seeing them lose like this must be so damaging to their spirit if your gonna have this much talent and just stink up the place all year im glad thier not getting bailed out by bullshit wins im glad they talked shit and got their ass beat twice in their home building by an inferior team i want them humiliated humbled and ultimately gone
where are the patrick queen apologists now i want to hear a actual excuse besides hes a rookie
wouldve liked a lob to dez but i suppose i understand not wanting to chance a pick but damn if you got him out there to do that take a chance
put a fork in us seasons over we never recovered to the collapse vs pitt and are now toasti
time for some coaching changes even harbs hes obviously lost the room
the lamar ints are getting old
what in world makes the coaches confident they can pull out an ot win

no matter the outcome this game is a loss in my book disappointing all around
this fan base every loss we can come baaacckkkk big trusss
you can call that holding but that was not pass interference
astros cheated
lmaoooooo
were just going to let them intimidate us and we cower sounds about right
this is why the offense has to score tds because soon henry gonna start getting 10 yards a carry if were down the whole game all they gotta do is the same shit in the playoff game
i just dont see the defense making enough stops
when we everybody realize that harrison is a better mlb than queen
how come i can only comment once every 10 mins thats no fun
were going to lose this game because we lost all momentum with that penalty
both teams have equally been shitty on offense
roman is a clown your an oc with the best kicker in the league your up 4 points not 10 just go for it
oh lamar that was fucking awful
can someone tell roman to keep running it

me roman deep passing it is

called it jfc roman is such a predictable moron
take this defense out back and fucking shoot them thats embarrassing
outside of turnovers we have the worst defense in the league change my mind
sigh this team always finds a way to lose
yeah thats season probably
im done on this team
defense is atrocious our only good receiver is andrews we are missing the best lt in the league and you are all putting the game on lamar fuck you
win the toss
here come the bullshit ot rules
unbelievable
lol
ball game
absolutely zero faith in lamar and roman weve lost this one because of those two i dont want to hear lamar postgame saying he needs to be better because its getting old now
gg guys its the same thing every week with this team unfortunately the reality is that even if we make the playoffs it will be another one and done
thats game put the thread up d better be blamed and no one else
fucking blow the team up
once again all week long it will be what happened to lamar on every sports show
i remember when flacco was drafted i remember the years before that i was a kid but i remember but i swear to god if one of you mfs bring up kyle boller like this team isnt bitchmade
this sub acting like queen should win droy because he made a hit on the qb after being unblocked
no ones gonna say it but lamars had another bad game
im watching illegal streams european raven subspecies decided to cancel the mf 200 gamepass subscription fuck nfl and noticed that these analysts have the best work in the world they look up weeklyseasonal stats and put sentences together according to them like tj watt is something he hit qbs 28 times this year and thats it thats their job thats what they get their paycheck for wtf
when do the steelers and browns play a competent team besides us jeeze
guys derrick henry scares the shit out of me
dez gets 3 tds today
wait i missed something how were the titans trying to disrespect
i forgot every time we do something a fuck shit olineman needs to get a flag
yeah ref ball my favorite
fucking patrick queens dumbass better show tf up today
looked like good coverage to me
why do we suck such ass on 3rd and long everygame
my stream is so far behind like a solid play behind
man gonna be a long day at this rate
we come out looking exactly the same as last week lmfao
fort blew his coverage
what a joke
no fight no passion this team just lays down and dies
lmao were in trouble
at this point they might as well let me try out for the defense
this defense had suggs lewis and reed among others and now were stuck with a bunch of shitheads outside a few players
yikes
their scripted plays looked good lets see how they do as the game progresses our offense needs to score a lot today it looks like
well i had a bad feeling about this game well have to see how it goes
this analysis of put more dbs to stop baltimore is so lazy that would not work if our ol would be healthy
lol love how the corner gets stiff armed in the chest by duv but doesnt fail to collect high fives from all his teammates
here yall go with the dickeating shit again hes our player
i think gus edwards smashed harbaughs wifedude needs to get way more touches
too much air
im liking the playcalling from roman here hes mixing up a lot of things only issue is execution and lack of talent imo
orlando brown jr has to be the most unathletic looking lineman in the league
this defense is so fucking weak
this games gonna get ugly soon if things dont change
so is harrison are staring lb now
harrison queen so far but queen is a good blitzer
kil1 greg roman
legit believe roman is trying his hardest to lose every game
people blaming roman when thats two tds taken off because lamar missed an open receiver
adam gase could do better
this is going to sound like a weird critique but id like to see lamar work on his scrambling it feels like whenever he breaks out of the pocket he does the same thing gradually close in on the line of scrimmage try and bait the defense into playing run then throw

if you want to pass first second and third watch what mobile athletic guys who pass first second and third like wilson and watson do change direction run around buy your receivers as much time as possible dont make a beeline for the line of scrimmage draw it out force them to chase you
beyond greg roman being a turd i must say that lamar isnt playing well either
dont worry rravens i got you on this next possession lamar misses an open wide receiver its all romans fault
dammit hollywood
soulja strikes again
soulja
catch it soulja
late throw but brown needs to make a play on that ball
damn tits you stopped us

jk lol
do we need to review everything these are pretty clear could you at least speed it up

oh right money
big yikes on powers
we have speedsters but cant have a deep route there
offensive momentum is all but gone now going to be over an hour since the last time they had the ball
getting it to 2110 here would be huge we usually play way better when comfortably up
love the elliott hits but at some point hes gonna be hurt again
peters fucking sucks on those man dude just never plays outside and overtop routes well
dez making 5 out of nothing what year is it
wtf that was a really bad throw
wow that was stupid
i want more duvernay targets but not like that lamar
run the fucking ball and milk the clock wtf
this is why i get so nervous every time lamar throws the ball
i guess this thread is so toxic that oeopke woukd automatically think i said fuck joe burrow its was fuuuuck that he was injured
whens the last time one of our receivers dived for a ball
queen cant run fit to save his life
watch the fake
being a pussy doesnt win football games thank god vrabel has his tail between his legs
fuck the refs he was 3 yards past the fucking line
come on defence
ravens we just cant play 4 quarters
come on guys your embarrassing me
another game the d is hung out to dry and made to look like shit in the 4th story of the season
we got lucky not good
yeaaaaah fuck this game
i fucking hate this shit wtf is wrong with yall
lmao holy fuck our defense is shit
so like no forward progress calls i guess
learn to wrap up clark sucks
embarrassing
wink has been the most overrated dc from this team ever dudes defenses get figured out every 4th q
its funny some think we have a good d
thats twice now the titans have gotten away with delay of game today
yall best fucking believe im taking names of everyone saying our season is over
we win the toss do over for the final drive
belee

dat
annnnnd thats game
pathetic fucking call fuck this year dude our superbowl window is closing by the year
game over trash
fuck this shit call me a fairweather fan if you want were better than this
were playing for field position dumbasses fucking low iq idiots
greg go fuck yourself a screen on 3rd and 17 really
tbh its likely tucker could have done more there 80 yd fg ez
outstanding play calls roman wouldnt want you to get dobbins more touches no please dont do that keep throwing to our elite corps of receivers hows that first round streaker hollywood doing today hey hows boykin defenses must shiver in fear when they see those two
fucking tackle judon he was right there
game over
harbs is in the hot for sure now this no excuse
blame of the game secondary defense
its over
aj brown would look so good in purple
well that its
bummer loss i was expecting worse with campbell and williams out however this is still a playoff team maybe only by merit of the window being 7 teams now

the olines inexperience and the lack of a game changing wr will be the biggest thing working against them

this game could have easily been a w if not for the false starts razor thin margins if these teams meet again in the playoffs the ravens will win lock it in

oh well on to the next one see you guys next week for another dose of punishment
we blow games all the fucking time yet i get down voted to hell for saying harbaugh has to go
patrick queen might be the softest player ive ever seen on defense
i guess you can use the ground to catch the ball
the flacco days were less toxic than this chill out guys we are getting the ball back its 70
what a dick move by powers
can we stop sucking off romo whenever he gets announced for our games his ravens commentary is shit
fake ass over reacting fans
this team is going to get blown out we are absolute fucking trash

chill everyone were two possessions into the game our guys are playing with plenty of fire titans had a great series of playcalling versus what we had schemed let wink adjust and well see
we should be going for it on every single 4th down if our defense is going to allow tds every drive
blame greg

blame lamar

that was fucking needless a downright shitty throw just an immature decision and even worse execution at least underthrow it so the defender cant pick it and has to go through the wr
that ball didnt look caught
almost unfathomable than an offense can go from league record status to incompetent in the span of a year without any major losses or coordinator changes its truly impossible to comprehend
theyre gonna drive down and score a td
guarantee we lose this team has shown no ability to move the ball
im done w this year
picking on marcus peters smart dude is a for real bum everyone loves him because he gets a pick every other game but he gets burned so often
cant wait for people to turn this against lamar love it
and theres the weekly 15 yard im a dumbass player penalty
ball hit ground
greg roman calls a pass play

goddammit roman run the ball

greg roman calls a run play

goddammit roman so predictable
i knew they would lose when lamar threw that deep int then a mod bans my account even mods are laughable here
if this is a loss there is no excuse for harbs to not be on the hot seat you let roman do the same shit so you are at fault
big truss woot woot
this is it the test is lamar a true qb or a gimmick
we suck again
boring way to end the drive all bark and no bite with this o
our defense is so fucking soft
i dont know about going for two here
welp

fire greg roman
ive been a hardcore harbaugh apologist forever but im really starting to think it might be time were so undisciplined i dont think changing coordinators will do anything
told yall wink was overatated good coaches expose his shitty blitz reliant defense
good lets have a gamewinning drive by lamar
here come a couple shitty playcalls and a pick
maybe this will end in a tie
at least houston beat new england
lol we fucking suck
lol
blame of the game defense
thats so raven

titans are a good team its the first drive relax
im starting to smell that 3rd place smells horrific
same weaknesses year in year out harbaugh hasnt done shot since the super bowl honestly time to look at other options if this season goes to shit
what does lamars contract look like
this sub is soooo toxic when we go down

cya fake fans its was getting a little crowded in here anyways
jackson is a average qb at best folks
we are not a bad team we are missing 3 key players gg

incoming l you all know it
fucking lamars gotta stop with these killer interceptions if its not there dont throw it

godam choke artist
lamar is just 1 interception away from tying his mark last year with several more games to go


edit hes actually tied it already
were the ravens were not getting the ball period sucks for us
oh my god shut the fuck up about this dudes dead brother and show us the ravens injury
fire roman and harbs in the hot seat simple
this is exactly why i hate romo constantly guessing the play being wrong and then being like herp derp well if it was me

like that shit is annoying when my bil does it and its annoying when tony romo does it

ray lewis would never of let this happen
i love romo
someone explain to me why we should keep harbaugh and roman
thomas wouldve stopped him
this drive might be the one deciding if im on lamar love or hate team

t
r
a
s
h
you guys are complaining about team discipline but yet harbaugh gets no blame come on
welp thats the season its been fun
season over fuck 2020
always stupid ass decisions by coaching and lamar that fuck us over fuck man
we gonna lose
this sub is so fucking miserable think the jets thread is less toxic so what if we arent blowing everyone out like last year youre gonna lose hope because we arent up 213 in the first quarter this is classic ravens always in a close game last year was an anomaly
lamar had two open wide receivers and couldnt find either good drive but we couldve had the win right there with better qb play
we have possibly the worst offense in the league no questions about it
i dont usually wish ill on anybody but i literally want the defense to chop henrys legs off and hit him so hard hes seeing starts and cant play fuck that fucking asshole
are there no streams leftlinks
hahahahaha gg
who tf is board and wtf is he doing
cmon offense we still in it
trash
lamars unwillingness to run and us having no wrs isnt the best combo
marquise looking like a real soulja lmaoooooooooo
a b c d level of rbs dobbins will b rb for years to come
defense has to step up since everyone is reading romans offense like a book
why does everyone assume its queen
i cant figure out what the hell lemar is looking at on the field and why the man cant figure out how to throw today under over floater the guy has no idea
ugh lamar is a chin strapper
okay that is absolutely unacceptable the booth didnt review that 40 seconds of time for us burnt
411 in 1 half is pathetic
brown out left elbow
whyd we do that
why
ugggh here we go
cant wait to lose the lead
all the offense needs to do is get into fg range
they are getting on a roll here
would it be crazy to let them score here were not stopping them and id like to have a few minutes to try and score
our linebackers are the fucking worst lmao
lmao
l m a o
turn off the lightss the partys over
to 20
in the house
big truss
woot woot

fuck this team
well that didnt go so well were either a good team or a bad team will find out very soon theyre my team either way
deep shot to hollywood
lets go win it lamar fuck those first four quarters
pain
welp
gg
calling it law of averages henry rush 74yrds td
its over defense is too soft
hahahahahahahahahaha
we are ass
rhythmic gymnastics team wouldve played better
lol
fuccccccccccurwhln vaetv zarygww
embarrassing better team won didnt deserve it so pissed utterly humiliating to give up those last 2 tds offense and defense equally shit today happy thanksgiving
bluff a trade for peters make him angry
i cant believe greg roman let the titans score that last touchdown
queen saved a big gain there put some respect on his name
roman is actually calling his best game of the season imo
lamar is back to playing bad again good to know
removed
lamar has straight up regressed anyone denying this is delusional
we fucking suck
gg
3117 titans win is my prediction
if we lose this game thats 2 games weve lost because of turnovers
dumb challenge just get the yard
has lamar ever had a comeback win
i want us to lose out we dont deserve shit and this team and lamar need a slap in the face youre riding on 2019 mvp status like cam did in 2016

wake the fuck up and play smart
lamar is just not a great passer hes fine but not great at all
harbaugh you didnt need to throw that flag

harbaugh needs to go im so tired of this soft ass team theyre a bunch of scaredy cats the second they face any challenge its pathetic
big trussssss we will next game big trusss
not gonna lie glad they won off a touchdown instead of a field goal got henry on my fantasy team my only team that might win a playoff game this year
queens just straight looking like a bust its early ik but jesus christ not even the flashes are there anymore
were 65 after thursday
at least well get a high draft pick
this team needs to be blown up both coordinators gone defense overhauled and lamar and haurbaugh on the hot seat

another huge lead blown we are tied when up 10
removed
removed
team choking as usual


i no longer believe in lamar
we fucking suck
were gonna be 66 in 4 days and donezo playoff hopes watching pittsburgh go undefeated and the browns make the playoffs 2020 worst timeline confirmed
loft it to the back of the end zone and its an easy td
harrison queen
jackson just can not get it done when defenses are playing him like this
we need to have the lamar jackson talk
cut his ass every fucking game
pernell mcphee is good for at least 1 roughing call a game and always on a 3rd down
if that was a fumble why didnt they make more effort to get it
how was that a fumble wtf refs


why is there always one throw that makes you wonder wtf lamar was thinking thererushed mechnics despite all that time in the pocket and awful accuracy there
here we fucking go man
ahahahahahha
unbelievable

everything i preach this fanbase and team ignores mean strong players and good oldl

so sick of this shit
is this your queen
just had to challenge that ball spot huh harbs
lol elite cbs
look at that deep throw outside the numbers i wish we had a qb that could do that
removed
chiefs were 64

henry owns this defense
harbs gotta be in the hot seat if we lose this game
out on lamar if we cant pull this one off
lamar is fucking killing us
man fuck this team tell them next time to stop drafting undersized people queen is undersized hollywood undersized stop putting all your capital on defense we gotta score too
i cant get hyped please help me out flock
wow our offense cant punch it in and defense cant stop anything gonna be a long ass game if we dont score a td next drive

i saw the wobble what a terrible throw
thanks lamar
also people need to realize that its not defcon 1

tennessee is an extremely talented team at 63 and new england always plays hard against us and the weather was complete ass
the titans are hoes on them we shall stunt
gg guys
titans making a statement they will win without using henry
good game titans
ezpz
does deshaun watson have a speech impediment
harbs with the rando challenge
this game aint over yet

you guys suck ass wtf
fuck you ravens
if next week wasnt thanksgiving game i wouldnt watch this team is absolutely a fraud
was last year a fluke
this team is a choke artist i called it like usual

fuuuck joe burrow

edit as in fuuuuck he got hurt
as much as i want pittsburgh to lose today do we really want to play them coming off a loss
the tractor is gonna plow through the ravens yet again
it has been years since weve had a qb who can throw the deep ball consistently flacco in 2012 i think that was the last time
this team is a weak loser team poor playcalls at certain times poor penalties and cant cover the flats for shit and keeps missing on play action
removed
fuck our defense
i dont want to win this game this team doesnt deserve to win this game to win this game would be a cop out for all the bad plays weve made today

removed
lol watching lamar play qb is painful
removed
removed
removed
not feeling too good about that humphrey contract so far
told you we would lose this team is so undisciplined especially with lamar throwing that deep for an int on 1st down with lead
removed

i predict the d will choke like the second half of the pitt game



removed
removed

belee
we also got wolfe for thishe and madubuike need to show out today
titans have one of the worst run defenses in the league shut up and belee
we cant get lucky
titans are decimated too just gotta go out and win

run the table
reminds me of the time flacco said he used to stay in the back and ray lewis speeches didnt even make sense to him
take ownership
incoming jackson 5
for first time lamar jackson is the one in the middle giving the talk in the final huddle after warmups

what were they fighting about tho

fuck the titans
classy huh
wtf
bunch of assholes
fucking hate the titans piece of shit organization with no superbowls this shows that they have a small club mentality
if the ravens arent tough enough to stop them why should i be mad
need this video
lmao your literal franchise is bunch of bitches
i hung my hammock got my pillow and ravens blanket all nice and fluffed up so i could lay back and watch the ravens and titans play but because i live in pg county i get insulted cbs has the washintonbengals game and the fox who usually handles the ravens game in this case has the browns eagles im completely and utterly disgusted
it really is ridiculous who wants to see fucking washingtoncincy crackstreams it is then
frederick county as well friend
yeah i live in moco and had to use nflbite
just stream it lol
my dad has both baltimore and dc channels but baltimore is in standard def better than nothing i guess
im watching it on the nfl app they have all the games if you have a tv provider
i live in cp and i have no problems thats odd

idk what i am looking at but i love it
damnit you beat to it
thanks i hate it
kachow
what the hell i dont care who the coordinator is lamar has got to know you make that throw and allow dez to bully into the end zone
not just that but hes starting to panic as soon as the pressure is coming i understand the o line is getting pushed but if he didnt panic i think he wouldve seen the 1 on 1 and delivered a good pass and possibly couldve gotten a roughing the passer penalty if he was hit

not umcdougalwu he fucking hates dobbins
put some old bay on the rock and feed that man
boys gotta eat
might want to try god
feed the hogs

feed the dobby more
i think this is where dobbins becomes the starter
dobbins with the octopus
fuck the titans always have been and always will be a trash organization
fuck em

until they make horrendous calls like that roughing the passer reviewable refs will continue to ruin games what a joke
i havent heard this many jokes since my last stand up show
i want kevin harlan back
everyone on the defense is either humphrey judon or queen depending on where the play happens
i love romo when he calls any other teams game he dick rides our opponents constantly
glad somebody is i wasnt


campbell and williams are out today against henry
derek wolfe so

and then lamar shading butler is the icing on the cake

what game are you watching
no
looks like we found gros burner account lmao

too bad harbs couldnt put that same energy into an effective offensive game plan

who is the voice on the games who says touchdown rrrrravens with all that bravado ive never been able to put a name to the voice and it kills me because i absolutely adore that guy and want him to narrate my whole life
gerry sandusky
gerry sandusky
thank you so much i love this fucking flock
bruce cunningham
gerry sandusky
that looked brutal prayers up to the kid and hopes of a speedy recovery
prayers up kid is a hell of a talent is so much fun to watch hopefully hell come back even better
feel so bad for burrow extremely pissed at the bengals shitty franchise for completely ignoring their ol
hate this for him that franchise is a black hole
season ending bad looking
oh this poor kid he works so hard for such a crappy franchise
i feel so bad for him getting drafted by that dumpster fire and playing his heart out just to take a shot to the knee like he did i hope he recovers fully and plays well 14 games out of the year
hope hes back on track next season kid looks like hell be a good competitor in the division for a long time i really hope the bengals dont ruin him before he gets a chance
really hope hes able to bounce back kid looks like the real deal he just needs an offensive line to speak of looking forward to him rejoining the afcns qb roster next season
feel bad for him good kid
he got carsoned on his first year v sad
i hope he gets better
what pisses me off about it is it was so obviously going to happen because of taylor being incompetent what a shame
any clips of the hit
shit franchises shouldnt get good draft picks how many players have wasted their potential on shitty teams with shit ass owners

the earl thomas memes are going to be soooo good
if you just jinxed this i swear to god
anybody got the highlight
idk what the title says but hell yeah elliott
anybody got the clip
didnt the next play he lit up the te after that big gain the boi looked slow getting up
yall done it again
love joker but i cant help but think hes a bit reckless with his tackling and hope he doesnt get himself injured
lol
bruh i need the video

deshon elliot made him his son
this aged well
earl had to preserve energy for the brotherly gang bang he had planned that night

as somebody who lives in az i hate the cardinals and all of their all of a sudden fans
i just want to say how proud i am of dez man

the dude was open on a good amount of plays that werent to him but shouldve been

seeing that fire from him talking trash to the other team

always seeing this dude cheering up our teammates and congratulating them whenever they make a play fucking love that and his fire congrats on him pushing himself back into the league and i hope to see more of him in the coming weeks maybe hes the real soulja we need this season
id much rather see him get the jump balls then hollywood brown
my friend is a dallas fan and told me if he plays as hard as he worked to come back we have ourselves a hidden gem going down the stretch that can really make a push for wr1
only wide receiver who decided to show up today except for maybe snead
one of the rare bright factors today
i know theyre bringing him along slowly but id be enthusiastic if i were yall he played a lot but very limited on his routes hes not a great route runner anyway but doesnt need to be in this offense

once lamar starts hitting him on slants some drag routes and some sideline passes its going to open the offense up if lamar learns that dez is open when one on one with a shorter player its going to be deadly

i cant believe im saying this because i love my cowboys but i hope dez has a nice homecoming in a few weeks
as a cowboys fan i tuned in to see dez looked good out there definitely going to be a factor
he needs to be targeted more
great plays today dez
dez definitely needs more targets and playtime he is a real one for sure
i think dez making plays will lead to a bigger role heres to hoping
cowboys fan here and hes my favorite player of all time you got a great one with him for however long you keep him around not only will he go to bat for his teammates and raise the energy levels onoff the field he will absolutely make crucial catches for you guys that catch and run before ot had me jumping i was honestly a little misty eyed watching him out there but im gonna have your games on every week from now on

take care of my man
give the ball to dez
love dezs attitude and i hope he can progress and help this team but if we dont draft a high quality big bodied wr in the first round of next years draft ill lose my mind
beast anyone that doesnt think so should be fired
the drop by hollywood at first down yardage near the sideline in the 3rd q was just totally unacceptable if youre gonna piss and moan about opportunity you absolutely cannot drop the easy ones

cant wait for dez to get more involved
put him in over brown
dez showed more promise today than any of our guys except for maybe snead that should speak volumes of our wrs
im skeptical but i was favorably impressed today its unrealistic to think he will be the savior of this stinking offense not for lack of wanna but depending on whether he is used right it looked like hes still got gas in the tank
ive always thought dez would be a great fit for us and i was super excited when we picked him up i thought we should have years ago hes the type of physical receiver that absolutely compliments our style of offense

if greg roman had any sense hed have dez and snead lining up outside and use hollywood in the slot to spread opposing defenses out a little especially with a banged up o line and no more great blocking tes
ravens fan since 2015 from europe here if dez stays with after this year my first jersey is gonna be that sweet black 88

just wanna see a td this year and him throwing up that x

x
he plays a great game on and off the field
did anyone else yell dez caught it when he made his first reception lmao
literally making history couldnt be happier for him hes earned this and his gratitude makes it feel even better a silver lining at minimum
i didnt watch the game for superstitious reasons and we lost anyway but all follow up reports emphasized how open dez was throughout they have to feed the beast let him get hot lemar has to scan the field or begin to trust more of his receivers
his biggest play was a totally improvised route thats what this team needs a veteran who can read and react to the defense
you can tell dez is hungry at this point i want to see him get more starting reps maybe even in lil marquises spot bc seriously the production at that position couldnt get worse than its been
most of the plays i saw was him getting the ball behind line of scrimmage and he plows through one or two defenders to get the extra 5 yards the yard after catch is a big importance dez will save our season
joe burrow got injured and it doesnt look pretty basically on the same level of boyles injury

couldnt even protect your franchise qb for 1 season i stg if he becomes the next andrew luck
i know i hate us too our season is over its been over


edit i really just feel dead inside
i feel for him there has been an explosion of elite dual threat hybrid qbs but hes by far the best pocketstyleplaymaker ive seen at quarterback in a long time wish he was in another organization for sure
there was also a season when baltimore couldnt protect our franchise qb its the nfl injury rate is 100 this shit happens
injuries are part of football look at 49ers half their starters are in ir or out because of injuries including their qb and nobody feels bad for them

henry forgot his first name on that hit good thing he has another one
this play really gave me hope wed win ngl
i mean the jokes on you really henry has owned this team
to remember how henry completely won the game for the titans you maschocist

is that you tom hows life in tampa
nice slippers
hes not so little lol
why does your dog look like he wants to murder you and the fat cat

also was that really not a first down by lamar feel the refs really sold that one
pretty much
its that stupid mentality thay they can force a turnover im all for the fruit punch but not inside the redzone
its been another game with bright spots but messy overall
spirit of etiii
idk i have no idea why none of our guy at least try to wrap up dudes feet or something just arm tackles with little effect
am i the only one to see that
tv clock vs game clock

ok

lol whut
wtf
yes
its so frustrating to watch the ravens wrs all they do is if their route is done they dont curl back to the qb or even gives him a chance lamar literally creates 56 seconds by himself but the weapons dont give him anything to work with this is really mind boggling how can anyone say theyre not getting targets when they dont put the effort to get the ball thrown to them
dez bryant looked good excited for him to be gameplanned out of the equation by roman like he does with all our weapons
dez looks good

the rest of the wr coup at this point performs like they usually do a couple of drops bad routes not making a play on the ball when its in your face not fighting for extra yardage its expected from them at this point
im not even sure if boykin has had a target in three weeks

praying for him i really like him
scary injury man hope hes okay this is what happens when dont protect your franchise qb andrew luck vibes
this poor kid hes got a lot of heart he plays like theyre going to the super bowl every game even if they get stomped i hope its not careerchanging
im honestly sorry to hear the human body is just not made for that
i made an exception of not taking anyone from the division other than ravens for my fantasy team just because i really like this kid sucks he was put behind that trash line and hope he comes back better than ever
nobody cares

thanks for all the love cant get rid of me that easy see ya next year

shit
balls
gooch

for the sake of this goddamn team
imagine waiting until week 11 to realize jk dobbins is a fucking workhorse back

and then not using him in the 2nd half
do you like running the ball on first down every fucking drive
do you like sending 5 guys on verticals because you cant draw up any other route combinations
do you like having nobody open on deep routes because you dont know what a fucking crossing route is

well boy do i have a coordinator for you
harbaugh has done it before and won a super bowl seems like a lot of talent is not being used the way it could maybe a jolt like this could give them a boost
honestly the defense was far far more shameful they literally melted down
you mean you wanted a run play 2nd and 7 at the 11 or 3rd and 7 at the 11
all you roman apologist please explain the first two red zone drives or how after 10 weeks he still choose to start ingram
3rd and 17 in ot in our own end and he dials up a screen god damn it
harbs letting this all happen with no heat whatsoever
where can we see what we cant see on tv i mean there are so many times where lamar is sitting back there with time and he doesnt throw the ball are guys just not open or is lamar just not seeing it you rarely hear browns name willie snead seems to be the only wide out who is ever open

that said if that is the truth you need to do what the steelers did picks rubs get the guy open over the middle etc and please play dobbins more
was bad on the 49ers bad on the bills and now bad on the ravens
cam cameron getting fired is what sparked our run in 20122013 so fuck it why not staring at 65 so might as well no creativity on first down and his unit seems to fail at the biggest times false starts botched snaps poor execution in general it doesnt all fall on him but someone has to fall on the sword
i was on the fence about this before but now im definitely leaning toward this side hes not the root of all of our problems but hes not really doing us any favors either a lot of people are saying lamar should be playing better and thats not romans fault but i do think that roman is not playing to lamars strengths like we did last year
3rd and goal before kicking the fg to make it 2424 lamar was sitting in the pocket and no one could get open i dont understand why we cant scheme guys open maybe lamar should have rolled left or right to maybe open up some space w a roving lber but i just feel that when other qbs on other teams sit like that all day in the pocket someone gets open eventually
teams have to respect the passing game in order for us to set up the run but roman is trash at developing passing plays combine that with terrible situational awareness not trying to get any points going into the half and we end up with an oc who is good at calling run plays when the run is needed but cant call plays that will lead to a comeback to save his life
what happened to the uptempo offense

likewe were completely flat against the colts then came out of the locker room in the second half running faster paced it worked fantastically against a topfive defense and then we justhave never gone back to it since

i can give some leeway in the pats game because of the weather but i cant think of anywhere i saw it today and i dont understand how you dont put that to use in this game

what kind of offensive coordinator finds something that works great even against a great defense and just never does it again
honest question who is both a better oc and available for a scheme that fits lamar
i dont get why we refuse to run the football the titans run the ball and they dont care if you know we have a stud in dobbins and he barely gets a sniff in the 2nd half unacceptable
and replace him with who

roman called a good game today i know people dont want to hear that but its true the ravens lost because they couldnt execute on simple open plays sure he calls a few bonehead plays a game but thats no different than last year the difference is the team executed last year and isnt this year
as a niners fan i knew it was only a matter of time before i would see this
yes this

the defense was bad today sure its been bad for a few weeks and with no one to win on the los due to injuries and rookie lbs who are struggling in coverage its gonna put a huge strain on the secondary in crucial moments

the offense has been a joke for weeks now and anyone who has all22 can tell you that its absolutely lacking creativity in formations routes and key concepts in key moments lamar looks frazzled to the point where i feel awful for him after breaking out in a huge way last season the ol is a disastereven without ronnie it should not be as bad as its been the wrs havent developed at all roman is a one trick pony hes gotta go who would replace him inseason though might not be until the offseason
please
not just for the team but for my own sanity
this is what it is always has been and always will be with harbaugh roman is just another failed retread coordinator whoever replaces him will be the same thing
i rly want it to happen but idk when it would happen no way they do it this week cuz theres only gonna be 4 days till the steelers game possibly after the game but we prolly gonna be 65 by then
damn beat me to it
once again greg roman is not the best oc but he is not the worst

you ravens fans dont get it

i am pretty sure it was not romans idea to trade away the second best pass catching te on an offense that depends on 3tes set for passing the football

and then refuse to upgrade the wrs corps while harming the tes corp

that is on the front office and how they choose to dump resources after resources after precious resources into the defense while the offense especially passing game suffers
hes a clown
we ran the ball on 16 of 22 first downs when you take out the two minute drives in each half we finished at 39 ypc thats the extent of the problem today
at this point fire everyone except decosta and harbaugh and if harbaugh fucks up picking his coordinators again fire him too
at least you dont have matt nagy
this guy gets itlol im a ravens fan true and true but where is the adjustment on offense i really dont wanna see lamar hurt fucking with our offensive woes
i agree at this point with switching something up at oc but lets be real would it even matter that much since we are getting deep in the season lamar for sure has to develop more in the passing game but we really have no receiving threats other than andrewsbombing it to butterfinger brown or an occasional snead it looks like lamar just notices no one is open and then panic scrambles i highly doubt there is going to be some random magic on offense with what we are working with i completely agree on feeding dobbins though as most people are mentioning
watching the cheifs raiders right nowafter the chiefs td drive i think hill caught 4 passesall within 10 yds of the losdidnt have a defender within 10 feet of him on any of them why cant we get duv or hollywood in those spots just boots and little flat passes and hill is always schemed wide open so frusterating watching a real offense work their skill players
the mans strangling this team with the leather belt known as his play calling
the titans needed a touchdown and a two point conversion and the defense gave it up
roman has not been the problem these last 2 weeks he didnt drop balls he didnt overthrow or underthrow receivers these 2 losses fall on team execution
i dont disagree but he called just a good enough game today for his seat to not get hotter

it wasnt his decision to force lamar to throw downfield int it wasnt his decisions that made marquise brown have bricks for hands it wasnt his decisions that led the ravens defense to forget how to tackle on multiple occasions it wasnt his decisions that led a backup center to false start

he didnt call a perfect game but he called a good enough one that we should have been able to win if we just played fundamentally sound football all the way around
yes please
likedoes he have money on the ravens not making the playoffs because hes calling plays like he has money on the ravens not making the playoffs
bring back matt cavanaugh so you bandwagon fans can see what real ravens offense looks like
agreed this was sad
roman didnt lose that game shitty tackling and stupid mistakes did
firing roman isnt gonna help thats against 2 bottom dvoa defenses lamar keeps making horrendous throws and hand punts aka deep ball picks agreed roman is the most replaceable and he should be replaced but this is more on lamar for sure
is he the coach responsible for teaching tackling
ill never understand bringing in skura and lining up ricard next to him on 1st and 10 and expecting to get anything on that play its an obvious run and its 1st and 10 w a jumbo package
i think some of this has to fall on edc as well they didnt make the moves up front to replace yanda and they still havent given lamar enough threats
already knew greg roman was going to be a problem in long run just like the 49ers he was great for one season and sucked the rest also he doesnt like passing
anybody remember when i said i was thinking about putting a stack on jk for roy right after the draft

edit i only put a 100 down i didnt get enough reassurance its gonna come down to jk and carlos of kc
i been saying this since he was hired es gonna get harbaugh fired if they dont win the super bowl this year harbaugh will be on the hot seat
i would want kubiak back but i dont know how he stands with the organization after he left
id like to see him work on his passing schemes dude only ever uses like 3 routes from the damn tree in his pass plays
remember when folks were shocked roman didnt get offered a hc gig in the offseason how many franchises are feeling like they dodged a bullet right now
anyone else hear romo the whole game basically making fun of roman when they were ignoring dobbins and dez all game
maybe wed be better off with romo at oc
i agree our play calling is shit at times way too many crap red zone options but fuck me gently with the rough end of a pineapple how many fucking mistakes do we keep repeating should have won the game with hollywood over the line but an early snap really after last week drew a penalty flag illegal formations have plagued us as have false starts and a couple of holding calls in recent weeks have cost us thats on the players our discipline is appalling were dumb really dumb we dont learn must be frustrating as hell for everyone i know im frustrated the dog is sick of getting booted during ravens games this year
just when you thought roman realized jk was the solution at the run game he was like hahahaha jk motha fuckas
yall got any more of that gary kubiak
greg roman has one too few gs in his first name for a coordinator on that alone he should be fired
yall mfs over react after every loss yes things arent clicking right now but we had the best offense last year please lets just give it some time
were 64 and this is an extreme overreaction offense looked better today give it some more time it would hurt the psyche of the team to get rid of him when were 64 and still very much in playoff contention
fire roman and please get rid of his ugly mullet haircut
easy to blame everything on roman but thats far from the case patrick queen needs to step up hes been getting steamrolled lately
missed the game just saw the score i didnt miss much based on these comments would have left him as run game coordinator
lol you cant be serious
our season isnt over till its over say what you want im going to continue to believe in us till its all said and done
other thing is its surprising that some fans get so mad they say fuck the ravens
stop it jesus christ greg roman didnt miss the throw to andrews or false start twice or throw the deep interception or give up 90 yard td drive the players failed

the ot drive was terrible but this game is on lamar he wasnt supposed to throw deep which led to the int and he over threw andrews on that easy 3rd down conversion
buddy this loss is not on roman its on the d with the exception of the deep int lamar threw i had no issue with his playcalling today
fire roman cut hollywood cut skura cut judon fire our wr coach and if harbaugh cant win a playoff game this year fire him too it will be time to move on il love harbaugh but this isnt a well disciplined team anymore the special teams fake the offensive false starts these are on the coaching staff we have been making too many mistakes and its costing us dearly


i really do believe lamar has the talent to win a sb but we have to be careful about his development get the right people in here who can help him out
so soon after priasing him last year seriously

cmon man its not just the coachng thats an issue here
doesnt matter whos calling plays your running back playing qb is the issue fucking noodle arm that cant throw outside the numbers hilarious season over you need you next year


the title says its all from week to week feel like everything about this year is weak one week the offense chokes the next the defense then the center cant snap other than the eagles dream team i have not seen a more overrated team in years
were one and done if we make the playoffs this is my least favorite ravens team in years so frustrating
there were people who looked at our schedule and were wondering where and if we would even lose a game this season coming off last season expectations were extremely high for this roster to take the next step unfortunately its increasingly looking like the ravens ran a gimmick offense last year that was figured out in the post season


this team will be lucky to make it into the playoffs its a pretty dramatic drop off from being many peoples favorite to win the superbowl
i been saying that the roster is overrated but we have had tremendous injuries at the worst time so idk
they fall to 8 in the power rankings my bet
we arent contenders im sorry but we arent anyone who thinks we are is overrating the team
extremely overrated
atleast we will get a pick in the late teens to draft another 5 for receiver
teams found better ways to stop lamarrbs running lamar didnt get any better as a passer when theres not much runs we are a mediocre team we cant beat a good team now hear people say we did last year and we did but dont see how we do that this year
very overrated we surely had some injuries but there is a lot more wrong here than just injuries
less now but they were very theyre not a top ten team theyre barely a top ten team healthy and thats with half the league being horrid

dez has been a raven for 2 weeks and hes already got more fire and desire to win than anyone else on the team
lmao what the fuck are the ravens even doing anymore

team has no heart this year and marlon was right at the end of last year this teams identity is to choke
fuck this season
this team is so fucking soft no energy or charisma just a shell of last years team
well at least dez did good i think
dropped passes poor routes false starts injuries lamar is clearly starting to not trust any of the looks hes seeing not feeding the hot hand consistently and just overall piss poor offense

really really fucking tiring
horrible defense at the most important times
fucking offense needs to move the ball
64 is a mediocre record and even that is a very generous record given how this sorry ass team has played all year
that third down at the end of regulation was so fucking frustrating lamar had about ten minutes to throw and no one could get open i dont know what more you could ask for in a potential gamewinning play
thinking thats a back breaker on the season we likely lose on thursday
secondary blew this one
we are not good we are above average but 64 is not good
i cant pick a single player to blame the team as a whole failed

other than dobbins our rbs were horrible
hollywood missed catches like he was playing with his eyes closed
until the very end all of lamars run plays had him literally running into our own offensive linemen
on amazingly long pass plays with lamar scrambling for 20 seconds no one could get open

take your pick
its really depressing watching other games and seeing teams with wrs that make contested catches consistently

anytime i see lamar throwing to someone unless theres no one within 2 yards i just expect an incompletion and even then we have souljas that will drop them
this entire team is just bad

edit ok ok youre all right tucker is still the goat
ravens before the bye fun to watch contender

ravens since the bye has felt like sticking my dick in a beehive for 3 hours every sunday
on a positive note it was refreshing to see dez getting the ball i havent seen a ravens receiver look so fired up since steve smith
im not mad they lost i dont care about their record what pisses me off is a consistent lack of fight this team shows week in and out i said it in the game thread and ill say it again they disrespect the shield when they play like pansies like that

another team the team that disrespected you and knocked you out of the playoffs last year by the way comes into your stadium disrespects the logo and talks shit to your coach and youre going to let them punch you the fuck in the mouth like that

you think a ray lewis led team would let that happen the difference between the titans and ravens is fight they had more fight in their dogs and it was obvious ravens just laid down and took it marcus peters has always been a flag football player so whatever but the other dudes on that aj brown touchdown embarrassing just embarrassing

titans are playing like the ravens of 20002012
what a waste of a season
fire greg roman upvote party
draft 3 wrs and 4 o linemen i dont give a fuck
up 2110 and the offense turns to shit with bad turnovers horrible penalties and sloppy plays the defense turns to shit and cant tackle anybody and gives every receiver 3 yards of cushion to let them catch every ball

hilarious
every game ive watched we lost im done watching games for the rest of the season
fuck greg roman
you let a team come into your house and whooping your ass in the playoffs stand on your logo talk shit to your head coach and then pull off a comeback overtime victory these mofos are soft period straight up spineless and heartless
blew a 2110 lead fuck this team
you know who didnt do shit this game marcus peters
pathetic
fuck the titans just fuck them
look at jk dobbins and derrick henrys stats

comparable in every way today except

henry got the ball 11 more times because they understand that hes great and that they win with him

stop forcing the ball to these ass receivers since hollywood bitched on twitter he has been terrible

andrews snead and dez were the only receivers showing some effort on the field tonight

the defense was as expected completely trash without calais and brandon williams

i dont have any interest in being pessimistic but ill say it again if those two players dont get back on the field soon then were going to get ran all over by every remaining team this season

zeke chubb james robinson mixonif hes back even wayne gallman is about to cut us up
i got hate for this last year but its very clear that taking hollywood over dk metcalf was a big mistake people said dumb shit like oh we cant develop wideouts anyways well so then why do you take one thats fucking tiny
yall call me fair weather but ive been here since 96

we are pure trash right now absolutely trash
take your pick for who is on the hot seat

harbs
roman

either lamar has no help with personnel or lamar isnt being coached the best way
this team is a disgrace they let the titans disrespect the field and did nothing
this is the angriest i have been at a loss in forever because it is so unbelievable yet so predictable
people are shitting on all things offense but the defense is what really lost this game
bro i am straight up not having a good time right now
this team is soft as charmin its fucking pathetic
man fuck them corner missing tackles like mofos comon guys ffs
fuck it this team aint ready im just going to accept theres no signingadjustment that will get them ready for january theyre wildcard upsetters at best
i implore people to go watch other teams wr play theres a good chance at least one of lamars balls to the endzone is a td and duvernay pick wouldve been an incompletion at best

this doesnt excuse the bad plays lamar made but he gets zero help on the other end other than the mark andrews catch week 1 i cant remember one of our receivers making a five star play
let the entire opposing team essentially tell you fuck you you fucking posers before the game and then watch them prove how right they were
pain
faded
im over this season this aint it
greg roman is fucking worthless
fuck this soft ass team
after what happened the last time these two went at it no excuses whatsoever for losing this game
is it just me or is this team just devoid of heart and personality this year no ingram hyping up the sidelines no truzz just seems so heartless this year
in come the titan trolls
what makes me the most sad is just seeing how soft this team plays win or lose the ravens have always been a gritty fight until the end team and now theyre just incredibly lazy in crunch situations on both sides of the ball its like they dont care and if the team doesnt care then why the fuck should we as fans
has hollywood just checked out i feel like after that tweet his heads just not in it drop balls poor route running etc just incredibly unprofessional
2013 86 in a playoff spot drop last 2 games and miss

2014 blow 2 14 point leads to the pats in divisional round

2015 88

2016 eliminated from playoffs in week 16 game against steelers

2017 eliminated from playoffs week 17 against bengals

2018 loss in wildcard

2019 loss in divisional


harbaughs seat better be red hot
so unbelievably soft

they came in talked shit and we rolled over absolute joke of a team
old ravens defensive players are rolling in their graves after seeing that effort of tackling

holy shit that was beyond atrocious
penalties have fucked this team on the final drive we were cruisin marquise had a wide open touchdown on that screen pass but the false start set us back then two plays later mark andrews was wide open for the first and lamar missed him this was easily winnable
i just feel like every break goes in favor of our opponent looks like the ravens have to work 2x as hard for every one if their yards then as soon as something is going well some stupid shit like an early snapfluke false start happens and instead of it just being a bump it torpedoes our drive we were about to win that game in the 4th
106 at best this year literally 14 teams in this league that are better than us lucky to sneak into the playoffs at this point when there are six teams fighting for three spots
im so livid i dont even know what to say right now

happy belated birthday to me lmao
fuck
gg this season
i love how the titans shit on the emblem before the game and we responded by coming out and playing like a pop warner team fuckin bums
now were 3rd in the afcn lmao fucking awful this was our window too itll only get worse
2 run plays after going up by 11 and you wonder why the defense got worn out
its infuriating because theres just so much unmet potential and last season set a really high bar as far as expectations

i do think they need to go in a new direction for offensive coordinator but no clue if there are better replacements for roman
call me crazy but im still optimistic for this season

get some key players back who are currently injured or hobbled simplify the offensive gameplan and teach the defenders how to tackle

schedule eases up quite a bit after next week

just gotta make the dance then who know what happens

although some of these losses are ridiculous but maybejust maybe things will start going the ravens way here

lots of games left dont give up yet ravens always seem to do better as underdogs as well for some odd reason

cant go 142 every year breaking all kinds of records as nice as that sounds
i feel like the performance of the 2019 and 2020 ravens teams should be reversed
lamar jackson left way too many points on the board today by missing guys wide open its becoming a problem i actually think greg roman called a good game guys were schemed open a lot

marquise brown is also looking like a bust he could be a decent wr2 maybe but i have no hope of him ever being a wr1
whatever just whatever
im sad i cant even enjoy dez balling out today
our 1 wr today was a guy who hadnt caught a pass since 123117 lol
patrick queen is reaching historic levels of flying under the radar he has been the worst defender on the field by far all season but a few sacks and fumble recoveries are saving him from scrutiny he is out of position 95 of the time he gets eaten alive in the run game and is leaning forward and gets caught by the play action every time
classic ravens
im starting to think missing the playoffs might actually not be that bad if it makes the front office aware of the problems on the team


im so fucking pissed
remember after thursday we play cowboys browns giants jags and bengals we can still easily hit 11 wins this year without winning thursday but i wouldnt expect much in postseason
theyre just not very good this year im going to continue cheering them on and hope for improvement as the season goes on though
getting fumbles is cool but tackling is probably more important secondary spent way too much time digging at the football instead of taking people to the ground thats what cost us in the end dline was stopping henry but then the secondary would give up rac on 3rd down trying to strip the ball that forced the big dlinemen back on the field and they got tired if we had williams and campbell in we might have done better because we had depth

aside from lamars int in the first half he played really well he needs to go back to scrambling like he did on the last drive of reg we would have had the td there if it wasnt for little mistakes like mekaris early snap or andrews false start
no offensive line skura is hurt phillips and stanley are hurt fluker is an athletic liability therfore cant protect the qb center is mediocre too many penalties that kill drives

wide receivers are useless other than snead marquise is too small cant separate and drops the ball at any hint of contact as of now hes a waste of a pick boykin cant do anything i guess duvernay is ok they should use him and proche more we have andrews and duvernay and snead and thats it otherwise passing to the back our some fullback or something thats not a legitimate passing game

x200b

no defensive line cant stop the run cant rush the pasher so wink has to blitz and now people are wide ass open

linebackers cant keep outside contain for shit nobody cna cover the flats for shit its as if they just assume no players will go there hence we keep giving up a fuckload of yards on the outside


all this combines to a mediocre team like we see beat up on trash teams and lose or get whipped by good teams
does anyone else feel like that game was dominated by the ravens for all but like 2 defense drives
i feel we played better than against ne took less penalties and some of the dumb mental mistakes were cleaned up edwards fed up a simple run play inside the 10 yard line harbs pulls him the next play

otoh lama is still floating deep passes and his run game was figured out on several plays but the rest of the team needs to show fight not talking about the barking at the opponent but contesting throws even taking an opi to prevent a pick etc our no 1 receiver was invisible was he a scratch

this teams being held together by duct scotch tape and it really shows
i shit on judon constantly cuz he deserves it but he played well today and seems to be minimizing his dumb plays

hope he keeps it up
so the browns are ahead of us now yet another feather in the cap of 2020
the lack of good receivers is really costing us lamar has a tendency to overthrow but having bigger receivers who can compete for jump balls would go a long way we need to be able to get big yard gains quickly but we have to rely on the run to get up field

58 hollywood is a bust he just cant compete as a wr
this is team remarkably mediocre
if you say we lost because of lamar youre an idiot plain and simple
this was a what did you say about my mamma type game on account of what happened last year i cant believe they fucked it up i know its committing suicide saying anything about lamar but they need to get that kid some help asap fire roman idk get your shit together cause your wasting a once in a life time type talent

this one hurts man this was a personal type game to me im sure for a lot of other people too and we dropped the ball smh
i cant wait for the post about how everything is just fucking dandy and the people not happy about losing games are fake fans yall know its coming
when i die i want the ravens to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time
im fucking done

all you shit fake fans saying truss and this gay ass hype shit

weve had glaring issues at ol dl olb and wr for fucking years we cant stop anything because one nt and de go down

thats bad depth

why do we break apart because one rg retires this is just a monumental collapse in every way

we need to clean fucking house judon roman hollywood skura ingram peters

just cut this dead weight


why do we not run bootlegs why do we only do play action 6 times in the entire game why do we go rbbc when dobbins is crushing it why do we go 3 pass plays on 1st and goal to win the game how do you run a screen on third downand 17

lamar blocks entire left side every 7 step drop and never sees open wrs this is a failure of coaching and then putting players in bad positions with shit play calls

fuck anyone who supports or wants to defend these decisions these are millionaires making off your viewership and nfl gear purchases you expect a good product not this sad cleveland browns bullshit


reed ogden suggs ray ngata would be fucking ashamed of this team
seasons over
got outscored 203 in the last 25 minutes of a game that has massive playoff implications and are now 13 since the bye are the people who have been all sunshine and rainbows about this team for the last two months now ready to admit there are some serious issues
anyone know what lamar is saying in the postgame press conference if its anything about him needing to play better he can get fucked sick of hearing that shit and he doesnt play better the next game
ive succumbed were average we look exactly the same as the late flacco years even with lamar jackson at qb this is harbaugh football
dont want to hear any excuses the run defense played good but the pass coverage was absolutely dogshit humphrey isnt an elite corner and wont be until he can actually not get destroyed by aj brown
selling out to stop the run and you do that
wow another blown lead and yet nothing will be done c
hate to admit it but last season is increasingly looking like a fluke this roster isnt competing with the top teams in the league this year barring a drastic change somewhere
every year i get so excited to watch this team play and every year they find a way to disappoint me in a spectacular fashion
whos ready to get real toxic lol
yeah im good on this year try again next year get healthy this team simply is not contending for anything this year
team needs big talented receivers to make plays notice titans receivers stepped up and made plays dez was our best receiver today and thats an indictment on the talent at disposal

defensively we are frauds guys dropping like flies here and cant even tackle or stop guys

its great having the browns and perhaps a group of other teams mia oak ahead of us in the playoff race s

edit 65 after thanksgiving guys book it
why is everyone focusing on the tackling by our d etc 30 seconds left 2 and 6 at the titans 10 or 15 game on the line cant do shit
we arent making the playoffs lol
firmly believe that there should be a change in snaps for dez at this point showed more heart and plays than players who have been on the team longer
draft offensive lineman draft them high draft them often i like decosta and i like harrison and queen but this line problem has been growing and spending a 1st and a 3rd in the same draft on a position ilb which we have effectively platooned and which usually only has one player on the field is no way to fix the problem
roman saying that we have a new revamped offense is about as truthful as mike mccarthy saying that he embraces analytics now
i hope the ravens get their shit together after thanksgiving my gf is a ravens fan i hate to see her upset about this team
m t junkyard
we took two swings in the first 100 picks of the draft struck out both times unbelievable god himself would struggle as a wr on this team
i knew wed lose today but the way we loss is beyond infuriating
whats up with hollywood he has 57 catch rate and thats not counting this game
we need this pittsburgh game bro
think its time to fire greg roman now or as soon as the season is over the chances of making the playoffs are slim with the last wildcard spot being such a tight race

the poor use of the rbs and the play calling has been puzzling dobbins clearly can play in this league and gets hot fast i believe gus edwards is a proper bruiser to put in there to chip away at the defense feed dobbins tire them out with edwards

i have no faith in the deep throws none of the receivers can get separation and mark andrews is the clear no1 option so hes covered hollywood is teetering on bust territory the receiving core is a clear problem would like to see dobbins hill and duvernay involved in the passing game more


also up 8 and fucking roman is letting lamar launch it 60 yards downfield we could ran it and played some situational football and been up two scores
ive been saying it since we drafted him hollywood is not an nfl caliber receiver

lamar doesnt have his head in the game this season they need to focus on making him comfortable again

play calling is still terrible driving the ball down the field to put the game out of reach and you decide to throw deep with your qb who hasnt connected all season yeah ok

mark ingram is still hurt

dez should be in all of our offensive packages
i regret watching today i knew i shouldve tuned football out
well at least we have our wr1 and wr2 in dez and snead
im getting less and less confident every day that lamar can lead us to a comeback hes young and the oline sucks but still disheartening
excited to see the lamar sucks hottakes which wouldnt exist if the center didnt snap the ball early love reactionary football speak
pain
rip
embarrassing
our offense is so bad so so bad
fucking team loss

offence choked away two drives then defence was like ill do it too
remember when people were claiming that roman was using the first half of the season to improve jacksons arm lol
not surprising without stanley and campbell
wasnt expecting this win but im disappointed we gave up that lead we had a chance on this one and blew it and we blew it twice already this year if we make playoffs we wont do much in them hopefully thursday isnt a nightmare
i hate this fucking season
defense was shit and deserves blame but the fact that we cant score more than 24 points every week is the reason we lose fire greg roman
well go 97 miss the playoffs and draft ugly
it utterly baffles me how the offense can drive downfield guns a blazin then completely flop when they get to the redzone ive been supporting greg roman for a long time because i think he was instrumental in lamars develolment last year but enough is enough stop the empty sets please they just arent working
we kinda suck tbh
we stink
injuries and shit playcalling are killing us
penalties penalties in key situations all over since last season
madden curse
there goes our playoff spot
we should have tried to punch it in on that last drive in regulation no one thought they were going to take this game in ot the way henry was starting to open things up
its cold outside we lost im sad everything sucks
dez bryant showed more effort than any of our other damn receivers sad
there are really ppl in this thread wanting to trade lamar im concerned
man i knew when we gave it back up 2113 it was going to be bad i remember clearly thinking we just want a fg here dont be greedy just 3 points and ill be happy
ill preface this by saying that going 13 in the past 4 is definitely concerning no matter the context

however heres some perspective as to why its not completely time to panic all 3 losses came down to the last possession they came against teams that have an average record of 73
worse than the browns lmfao
as a positive note dobbins and bryant when used were fantastic the line also played surprisingly well considering the shuffle

but man roman is just so fucking bad we cant throw the ball at all and defenses are just openly challenging us to do it roman has done nothing to get duvernay or hollywood open in the intermediateshort routes and i just dont know how much more of it i can take

miles boykin is also a waste of a roster spot at this point please just give all his snaps to dez and give dezs old snaps to proche
im so tired of seeing bad offenses
can someone explain to me why we cant scheme any of our wr open at any time why are we putting our fourth string rb out wide on multiple plays instead of actual wrs
i live in nashville now i have to listen to how the titans are better for another whole year lets beat the steelers flock if we dont do that might as well lose out for a draft pick
this looked like a game from 2017 flacco the offense somehow getting a couple first downs and then relying on field goals
at least were getting disappointed in the regular season rather than the post season so farp
the pass game is nonexistent on this team even the crappy teams are making passes look effortless with us its like trying to squeeze water out of a rock
cmon this is not about the d choking as depletedas the dline was the only way to match up was to take titans strength away that strength is the power runhenry and tannehill pa off that run threat the only way to take that strength away is to get up on them by two scores either early or late the d had just held them to a fg to make it 2113 early in the 4th this was time to protect the ball move the chains eat some clock ad get some points any points to make it a two score game with probably single digit minutes left to go when the drive was complete 1qqaand that would be the point where tannehill would have to beat us without the power runpa threat he is barely average at best when forced to play that way so while were grinding the ball moving the chains and eating clock roman decides to take a shot on a deep ball the one thing that this offense may be the poorest at there are those who say they liked the call there are times and places to take that chance but that point in the game was not it three points at that part of the game would have made it much harder for the titans to get back in the game instead they have the ball plenty of time and can still stick with what their strength is with their powerpa which our depleted d can not keep contained for ever trying to fool an nfl team by trying to surprise them with what you arent good at doing is stupid coaching and unforgivable at the nfl level roman has to go now not tomorrow now im tired of hearing that the wrs are the problemi get it they cant get open but they are what we got but a lamar led offense can still overcome that even with our depleted oline if we stick with what we do best but we never do this will only get worse as long as roman is here this is exactly what happened to the 49ers after 2014 the rest of the league just sat back and waited for roman to do stuff that his offense wasnt good atwhat kapernick wasnt good at hes doing the same thing now and wasting the talent that we have in lamar fire him immediately this will not get better as long as he is running this offense
what are the chances we can get someone like bieniemy in 0001
you guys do realize we play 5 trash teams and the steelers we arent great rn but if we figure it out and go at least 42 51 were a wildcard team
guys im really sad
welp its a short week too doubt anyone gets fired or we see any meaningful changes
on a positive dobbins is a fucking beast
so jk and lamar are pretty much saying that the titans showed more effort than them this team is so soft from a mental standpoint
patrick queen has got to get it together hes a liability
this game sucked but did anyone else see the titans tackle coming down on the back of wolfes knee that was some cobra kai bullshit
can i just say that the titans are legit the most classless fanbase in the nfl not even afc north divisional rivals act like absolute clowns the way they do

even with the steelers theres some form of mutual respect there we talk our trash before the game but we have some level of respect afterwards because its always hard fought the titans have absolutely no respect for anyone including themselves
probably doesnt get said enough that we were remarkably healthy last season this year were probably around the nfl average in terms of injuries thats been the biggest difference so far imo
titans fan here i looked through both subreddits throughout the week even commented on a few posts here and neither fan base felt confident we came out with the win but that doesnt always mean as much later as it does in the moment

this next statement is not me trash talking but just making a statement even the bottom seed can make it far we did it last year your team has done it before hell the freaking giants beat the undefeated pats in a super bowl

season is far from over gents
greg roman fucking sucks and should be fired now marcus peters played like trash all game
i want off this ride
this is most likely the season cleveland takes second place the titans take our playoff spot we literally cannot lose another game
aaaaannnddd just like that im checked out of this season
so fucking sick and tired of watching this team collapse and get embarrassed week after week

bisciotti and decosta need to step in and make some changes now to try and save the season roman needs to go harbs needs to fear for his job and these players need discipline
looking at the schedule i think we are still a 10 win team the question is gonna be if 10 wins is gonna be enough for a wildcard the way the afc is shaping up
why did this defense give up 11 point leadincluding a 90 yard drive with a two point conversion and an ot td

the ravens front office moronically spent all their damn resources on the defensive side of the ballto only allow one dimensional teams that can barely pass beat them
they call him hollywood because he acts like a 1 receiver but hes just pretending
awful lot of fake bandwagon fans in this thread probably only started rooting for the ravens last season
this team sucks and nothings gonna change decosta had 1 terrible draft and one mediocre one the coaches suck and lamar is not helping us
we have to stop blaming greg roman for everything this offense does wrong the single biggest difference between last season and this one is execution lamar is missing wide open throws its really that simple this isnt scheme its execution

roman isnt perfect but he wasnt perfect last year and the difference was it didnt matter because we were always way up
and ill add if significant changes arent made at coordinator positions roman or deeper i want harbaugh out thankful for him but his system just doesnt work anymore
done with this team this season bunch of bums
its painful watching rookies like herbert and burrow or other young qbs like mahomes or josh allen and then watching the supposed mvp this year
idk man lamar has to come big at the last drive he just misses i hate roman as much as the next fan but this game had fine play calling

also our cornerbacks need a tackle session asap this season its probably fucked i dont see us winning against pittsburgh and cleveland sadge
fake fans
bunch of fair weather mofos in here i swear yall are more embarrassing than this loss
defense dead
lol fuck me im done
this feels like 2012 but worse
who we taking in the draft
this is the worst winning ravens team in my life fuck
learn how to fucking tackle
best thing to happens to this team would be to miss the playoffs
offense is shit butt nothing more to say
this is a bad football team nothing else to say overrated defense incompetent offense and a league mvp with unprecedented regression
wink is bad guys time for yall idiots to realize blitzing all the time is absolutely shit
well we are about to be 3rd in the afc north
ive been optimistic long enough this team is just bad the only thing we have is a run game in which we abandon often for whatever reason
we dont deserve a playoff due to poor wr play this season and injuries to defense and that putrid o line
i dont think we make the play offs at this rate were too banged up for a deep play off run
this is the game i stop revolving my sundays around the ravens if im free great if not ill catch the highlights
another double digit lead that we choke away we fucking suck
see yall next year
fuck this season fuck the nfl and its rigged reffing and fuck this coaching staff
both defense and offense sucked today
unfuckingbelievable
theres no dog in this team just whimper
couldnt even protect the shield
that one hurt right in the heart feels sick to lose that one defence gave it their all but the offence didnt put the damn game away when they should have i hate this season and 2020 for the ravens
sad
blame teams attitudeapproach
baha cant tackle shit
will roman be fired
patheticcccc
wellhere we are again
whole team is trash especially fuck marcus peters
this was a big game and a huge loss but there were some good things too this team can still go 106
fucking sorry ass performance we had that game too and just kneeled over and took it
season is cooked this offense is absolute trash and our defense cant maintain their high level of play while watching the offense squander it away
and the browns are about to overtake the ravens in the wildcard race
fucking pathetic play from everyone were lucky if we even go to a playoff game
its not just lamar this whole team isnt clutch

i literally dont have positive takeaways any more roman was suspect as fuck again too many wasted opportunities receivers were bad defense was ok initially but got gashed line was mediocre as fuck too and tons of dumbass pre snap penalties hate to say it but this aint a playoff team
how disappointing
secondary played their worst game of the season unreal
that final defensive play with the running td was a perfect synopsis of the entire game
we havent always matched up talent wise against other teams past years but at least we would come out and played like we wanted to win and smash their noses in can we say the same thing about this team
you have to believe with campbell and williams the ravens win that game theres just too many injuries
fuck the defense and fuck the refs
somebody has to answer for this surely
defense have not been able to get a stop once this year when it has been absolutely crucial this year add that to the worst redzone defense statwe need to toughen up
this has not been a fun season
i expected to lose that game and here i am still disappointed the last quarter was embarrassing for everyone
our secondary is supposed to be the backbone of this team the past two weeks theyve looked like fucking ass

cant cover shit
cant tackle
if harbaugh comes out with well just need to refocus were almost there bullshit im going to lose a lot of faith in him
at least we might have a chance of getting rid of roman
after we lose to pittsburgh and inevitably cleveland we will finish 10 and 6 and miss playoffs
four drives having to settle for a field goal in the red zone just isnt acceptable
self inflicted wounds today just like all season these arent the types of things that magically change halfway through the year ive never seen so many illegal shift penalties just dumb
no heart
not even that mad i expected a loss
hell no they dont know greg roman has got to go upvote party
how is that not a hold on jonnu we were losing anyway but like can we draw 1 fucking oline hold this year

this is fine
this season is over to be honest not negative
bruh im gonna throw my remote through the tv next fucking dumbass penalty we take such a terribly disciplined team
guys we arent missing the playoffs lol calm down last year taught us very well regular season dont mean shit and its very hard to beat a team twice so if we see these mfs again we winning we were close asf injuries fucked us wouldve won with stanley in and campbell head up flock our season is far from over
i knew we lost when lamar threw that deep interception on 1st with over 7 point game lead fuck roman
how many times in the second half did we blitz and tannehil threw dinky out routs for 1020 yards what the fuck is scheming any more
im getting worried that this team is going to start imploding in the locker room and behind the scenes this is definitely going to be a test for harbaugh
stupid lamar int missing andrews on the first rz trip missing him on the 3rd down ill give him credit for getting us into ot tho also the 2nd loss after leading at the halfso maybe well trail at halftime against pit win doubt it but whatever
no one other than dobbins came to play pathetic all around
the ravens have just made me a sad boi the last couple weeks

i was looking forward to beating pittsburg but idek anymore
one player who can be commended will holden played his ass off after getting called up today
preseason damn our secondary is gonna be the best in the league nobody can run or pass on us

this week secondary not only refuses to tackle or cover shit they just watch the plays have the fucking time jesus christ somebody needs to get fucking fired this week to send a message how tf do we lose these fucking games
welp time to just watch college football now at least alabama is undefeated
well hey at least the nba is back in a month
firegregroman also fuck hollywood he cant catch a ball with his fragile ass hands play dez more jk needs to start lamar deserves better from us
this loss really hurts man they came back made the adjustments the play by aj brown was absoluty heart breaking nothing has been addressed nothing has been fixed were probably going to be embarassed by the steelers on national tv

anyone whos like you have no truss

shut the fuck up we are literally doing pretty much everything wrong
after this performance someone needs to get fired this team is soo damn lazy and i think our last season dominance made us wayy to cocky pathetic performance i am so pissed at this years team
just infuriating to watch so much potential being squandered were pretty far from a lock to even make the post season rn
we are behind the browns now
team is soft
so many penalties so little effort the fuck is going on ive seen bad ravens teams but one without spirit is rare
this team genuinely makes me disappointed all the flacco check down years you still felt like they gave a shit this team is weak mentally and physically and it shows
i feel like if you end up behind the browns in the division someone needs to be fired
hello darkness my old friend
lose out and draft a receiver but not the receiver we want choose the guy we definitely dont want like when we didnt want metcalf or aj brown
awful
greg roman needs to fucking con
allowing the td prior to the end of regulation when they could have at least forced a 4th down attempt the fuck man
another game where opponents just arent penalized
blowing that lead was absolutely soul crushing i need a break from ravens football
all that trash talk and bumping look so hollow now that we got handled in the 4th and ot i hate the titans though
fucking donkeys
we suck
hollywood having 0 catchesincluding one terrible drop while diontate johnson is on a recent tear the past two weeks aj brown giving ten that td at the end of regulation is just awful

same with claypool having 10 tds this season but boykin probably not even having 10 catches what did we do to the football gods did we talk to much shit last year
lol the comments in here
tank for trevor
i didnt expect us to win this game due to injuries but it still sucks to have it be close and lose if we make a couple plays we win this game but thats been the story the last couple weeks and it started with the steelers game
did ingram even play mark andrews dez bryant willie midget snead and jk dobbins are your entire offense
we had an opportunity to get revenge and we blew it we deserve all the shit we get after this one
thanks for the weekly reminder how trash the sub is
the titans are actually shit i cant believe we handed them a win
you know im actually happy henry scored on that last play because it was a lot less painful than watching them inch closer then hit a field goal
they come to our stadium and dance on our logos and beat us by 7 in ot lol what a pathetic excuse of a football team we are like someone coming to your house and telling you theyre going to fuck your wife and you do nothing to stop it
last couple of games we have looked like the 2025th best team in the league is flacco back under center
this is 2016 season levels of frustration
we cant even say at least we arent the browns anymore sad times
at least we were good last year lol felt nice to actually be that dominant team for once now were back to the scheduled 88 team we have always been
we are overrated af
we deserve every ounce of shit we get after this one
embarrassing defeat this team just loves to choke playoffs are gonna be rough
ravens cheeks bro
not making playoffs
defense shit the bed second half plain and simple a few key penalties based off mental errors killed some key points of offense but the tackling was nonexistent in the second half i get it theyre gassed but they cant let up and they did

call me crazy but i thought our patchwork oline didnt do a terrible job lamar had a bunch of plays where he was able to take some time and try to find someone even if he didnt actually find someone and not be pressured he was able to get some key yardage i am mad we lost but realistically im surprised it was that close of a game
this is painful but this is also expectations my buddy is a dolphins fan and was happy to be 63 where as i was disappointed now after today even moreso
4 games behind fat fuck soon to be 5
well as a liberty flames and a ravens fan i would like to go back in time and just sleep through this weekend
instead of the ravens raiding the vikings for some wr talent the ravens raided them for dl help

unbelievable pure incompetence
man fuck this bs our d played like a bunch of little pussies that couldnt tackle minus elliot o boy its gonna be an angry podcast tomorrow
lamar sub 200 passing again this is the fucking nfl dude no one wins games with sub 200 passing
wasnt able to watch the game my last missed game was around 2017 so ive watched every single game since can somebody sum it up of course the game i miss we lose
im suprised you guys didnt target will compton at all whenever brown when out of the game probably could have completed a pass every time
not many people are bringing him up but other than the forced fumble yesterday i havent heard ngakoues name at all since we got him one sack and five total tackles in four games with us
really confused by all the comments both from players and fans saying the team had no fire or no heart if anything thats what they do have what they dont have is competence or discipline
jackson is just not that good sad to see
watching other teams just pisses me off why cant we have good receivers
lamar has to take some blame for this one didnt play well enough
yeah im somewhat out on lamar you cant be this inaccurate and win a super bowl hes young be he absolutely has to improve on accuracy or else he will be the next kapernick
lamar did not play like he deserves big qb money
fuck roman fuck injuries fuck everything
fuck greg roman been saying this since literally week like 5 and last years playoff game but he fuckinf sucks
holy shit we are now facing 3 strait losses and the titans and pats arent even good fuck this season dont even control our own destiny anymore
gotta look forward to 2021 need major changes just really no heart anywhere on this team and it makes watching almost like a chore idk defense isnt good unless garbage teams and offense gives the same mediocrity for like the tenth week in a row
once again the center position has fucked us
this team has been sorry since the 2014 season but they were coached up then the talent deficit really showed right before lamar took over he dragged the team to the playoffs twice no way in hell we sniff the playoffs without him last year let alone 142 and now injuries and a stale scheme and frankly some dudes drinking their own kool aid is rearing its ugly head this team has raw talent but fuck this they need to take their lumps miss these playoffs wont do shit there anyways and get back to the drawing board the higher we pick the fucking better this isnt like 2012
yall shitty fans we were winning most of the game and lost in overtime it was a close game with a good team and we lost it happens

were a winning team we will be back love yall
we played hard and we are still 64 cant wait for thursday itll be a tough game but we will get the win

yall calling for us to tank are wack yes we are playing horribly but after next week we have the easiest schedule in the nfl and we are at 64

i will always prefer a playoff game over a mediocre draft pick always

roman sucks but lamar isnt doing much better he absolutely is not becoming the qb we hoped hed be im sick to death of hearing him say that he needs to be better and then play like a mediocre qb the next game
eric bieniemy for head coach
same shit different week coulda shoulda woulda blah blah blah bunch of pussies today no clutch gene at all no one has confidence on the team
the titans are hoes on them we shall stunt
the titans are hoes on them we shall stunt
removed
you could put this loss on a number of things but for me it was 2nd and 6 on the 10 with a timeout and absolutely refusing to run the football kind of sums up the entire season right there
im checked out on this season this team has no heart and we cant close out games i love them to death but i dont need to watch the last 6 games to know what happens
still gonna make the playoffs after thanksgiving the schedule is super easy jags giants cowboys and bengals without burrow is 10 wins and then the browns who we already beat 386 hopefully all the bandwagon fans are gone now lets beat pittsburgh next week
has lamar ever had a game winning drive like when we are down by 26 points and he drives to score to win
makes you appreciate just how special a season like last year was still love most of the team but need to go back to the drawing board in almost every phase
harboughs a baby
3rd place
not going to be pessimistic since im at work still and only saw the andrews td but very disappointing this defense by itself dont even mention lamar will never compete with chiefs or steelers so gg 2020
lamar kept the ball too many times on read options imo
what really sucks is how little help were getting from the nfc other than the cardinals pulling out that miracle play last week the nfc has shit the bed against all the afc contenders maybe gb can hold on today but man we could use some luck
f
the rest of the afc north looking at the ravens self destructing da frick they doin over there
im as disappointed an demoralized as everyone else but theres some shady fans around here talking about youre checked out for the season and youre not watching any more ravens gams this year why cause were not 91 were not 82 scoring 40 a game every season aint smooth sailing but you dont just give up fake fans
removed
jackson is exposed now just like rg3 kap and other running qbs of the past only way he can regain his mvp form is if he learns to throw in the pocket
hanging up my jersey this team was on its heels before this big switch up and now we are out of the playoffs before thanksgiving we are a joke and to wear this shit around is embarrassing we dont play defense we dont block we dont do anything productive and this is our coaches fault get rid of harbaugh the name is shot everyone knows how to win against us and we are lame ducks the refs couldnt be unfair and we just straight lost three kicks and justin tucker knew that third kick he didnt want to be out there his talents are wasted in baltimore when he is kicking under 45 yds he looked at the goal posted and said real rolled his eyes and put it where no one could take a point away not tripping our coaches tripping our qb tripping wide outs and dbs tripping beside dez byran running out the backfield wtf trow the ball meanwhile marquise is tripping hard trade alertzz this just in the defense without campbell is nothing us hyping up those thick headed corners and safteys that punch instead of tackling and thats why every team talks shit to us and backs it up they get touchdowns we dont simple shit we shouldve invested in oline nope we go with more defensive help and they dont work in general we need more than just a d line maybe a fast safety like budda just saying they get those peters used to but they stopped throwing and hes been figured out be the other wideouts just no good can i be a coach can i be lamars personal everything man sure if i could tell these things to the front office because they obviously dont see it and these steeler reporters that dont know football keep hiding the real issues with why we get sacked and why we have bad pass attempts or fumbles because pressure last week in practice they went outside and couldnt preform a simple ladder drill and it was sloppy asf i say stop buying the player merch and stop following them because all it does it make them feel like they are good and obviously we arent the pats have a better chance at the playoffs rn and i never thought that hats off to belicheck
half this team deserves to be cut do work eric start with marquise and peters
atleast you guys have a good kicker
big trusss
was never a fan of the lamar pick but with the success of last year he got me liking that play style this year however he is loosing us games if we had daniel jones out there we would be 73 maybe even 82 our front office has to see this we cant give lamar a 40 million dollar contract

lamar jackson rg3

idek the whole team played really bad when it counted
whoever is teaching the ravens how to tackle
peters they just fed the ball to whatever receiver he was covering

secondary couldnt tackle shit
the wr group just sliding under the radar for being non existent the past 5 weeks
marlon and peters they got beat like fucking drums all game
theres a lot of blame but marcus peters he got burned so many freaking times this game it wasnt even funny dude got exposed and didnt make a big play to make it worth it
team loss except dobbins

offense choked on two critical drives and only got 3 points off a turnover

defense forgot how to tackle in the fourth quarter

you can blame the coaches you can blame the secondary you can blame the qb for two horrid throws you can blame our stupid wrs for not being able to catch covid at a trump rally and you can blame the running game for being worthless except dobbins he is cool
i am once again asking the ravens to fire greg roman
unbelievable play calls by greg roman once again



you have jk dobbins running like a damn freight train and in the second half its like he was fired why is it so hard to figure out how to remain consistent when something works we stop doing it
greg roman
the entire team from offense to defense to coaching
greg roman this was an offense that supposedly made adjustments to be better and it was exactly the same its time for someone new because we have enough tape to justify we cant beat the good teams
secondary
whole team
marcus peters the entire offense bar jk dobbins

x200b

edit new offensive identity my fucking ass
marcus peters

patrick queen

lamar jackson

greg roman

don martindale

john harbaugh

take your pick theyve all been fucking horrendous
im over all of the greg roman apologists hes doing the same thing he did in san francisco and if he doesnt get out hes going to destroy lamars career
if im gus edwards im not working on getting a contract to come back to baltimore next year three touches today is all he got id make it through the season and be looking elsewhere where im going to be used to the best of my ability
i saw dobbins get frustrated when he was doing his job and then they pulled him for ingram baltimore is dysfunctional right now and losing today is time to worry because as it stands right now theyre going to get bulldozed on thanksgiving night
peters tackling was atrocious and got torched by corey fucking davis
felt like romo was calling better plays than roman
we are the most unclutch team in the league right now whenever we are in a position where we need to score you can guarantee that we wont its not just lamar its not just the receivers its not just the coaching its not just the secondary its not just the o line its not just the linebackers everyone turns into the fucking falcons
sergio kindle
secondary theyre all more interested in trying to create turnovers instead of tackling
the entire secondary besides elliot
look at jk dobbins and derrick henrys stats

comparable in every way today except

henry got the ball 11 more times because they understand that hes great and that they win with him

stop forcing the ball to these ass receivers since hollywood bitched on twitter he has been terrible

andrews snead and dez were the only receivers showing some effort on the field tonight

the defense was as expected completely trash without calais and brandon williams

i dont have any interest in being pessimistic but ill say it again if those two players dont get back on the field soon then were going to get ran all over by every remaining team this season

zeke chubb james robinson mixonif hes back even wayne gallman is about to cut us up
the answer is heart we have none we have no heart
the coaching team
red zone offense
greg fucking roman
the secondary had some of the worst tackling ive seen in a long time holy shit
mental errors

these penalties are fucking killing us kill any drive we get started been all season
marcus peters dude didnt even try to tackle
coaching overall complete shit
coaching there was no fucking effort in our tackling all day it was embarrasing i will take a fucking loss if you at least okay your best
the organisation top to bottom outcoached
coaching secondary only two rb rushes in the second half not doing anything to adjust to ten just moving the ball with ease if that ten replacement center did not fuck up that snap to henry we wouldnt even have had a chance to win in ot
marcus peters
it has to be coaching at this point unfortunately the team looks completely defeated anytime they face adversity play calling and effort are just abysmal on both sides of the ball a lack of discipline shows up in penalties but also botched plays players out of position im honestly amazed the team is doing as well as they are playing so poorly at times the team is missing a heart thats so very clear now
why did we pay marcus peters hes good for turnovers against mediocre receivers once hes lined up with anyone decent hes absolute garbage
also the refs continue to just be fucking horrendous
harbaugh this team had zero fire all game they got manhandled and out coached again
coaches how you even call that deep pass when a field goal realistically wins you the game is beyond comprehension roman is an idiot but is harbaugh really that much better for allowing this shit to happen
ravens in the clutch
its not as if nobody played bad secondary couldnt tackle aj brown offensive play calling stalled out a lot jackson randomly threw an arm punt for some reason oline gave up a big sack late however despite all of those the ravens had this game in their hands from when they were up 2 scores to the last drive where they settled to the overtime drive where they went 3 and out fact is great teams win this game and baltimore didnt on to pittsburgh but this one stings like kc loss a prove it game where the ravens just didnt
roman at the most crucial point of the game where we needed to protect the ball move the chains eat some clock and guarantee at least three points to make it a two score game with less than 10 minutes left he dials up a deep pass which is probably the biggest weakness of this offense you win in the nfl by playing to your strength and taking the opponents strength away not being able to put the titans down by two scores there was th killer the d had already done the best they could to hold the titans to 13 points in the 4th to expect them to keep that up without campell and bw out was unrealistic the o needed to take charge keep the d off the field and find a way to score while eating the clock to do otherwise killed us this is not on thed and bad tackling bad talking is going to happen when you are trying to punch the ball out and cant fire roman now
i really dont know who to solely pin blame on this game theres shit to go around everywhere

lamar was not good today by any stretch and left multiple plays on the field there were numerous occasions when dez had a cb 15 yards off of him and lamar didnt fucking throw him the ball on a quick slant he also missed several easy throws however he had the drive to tie the game where he was masterful

the defense contained henry all day long and even gave the offense a turnover with favorable field position but the defense also allowed 17 4th quarter and ot points to lose us the game and choked so fucking hard moreover marcus peters had a fucking awful day in coverage and patrick queen is just completely lost on the field in every way

hollywood brown again disappeared today on a day where the titans secondary was playing without basically any starters

i just dont know where to put the blame so ill default it to greg roman so many times today i saw the offense have favorable situations just to run a stupid fucking play and squander it i also cant blame anyone else for our guys not getting open deep if you dont have the wrs to separate scheme them open
harbs this team is flat game after game and always undisciplined that falls on the coach
cornerbacks and lamar corners gave up too many plays and missed too many tackles lamar missed too many passes in big moments
refs and coaching same shit every week
secondary was atrocious tackling was just as bad greg romans hot and cold play calling lamar jacksons mental mistakes and picks dline played reasonable for being down its best two interior players but marlo and peters played like undrafted players
lol
lamar cant fucking throw

coaches all of them not sure what the fuck that defense scheme was

marcus cant fucking tackle and he fell for the same play action like 4 fucking times no variation same exact fucking route
we cant tackle
the entire secondary
red zone offense
two huge false starts
a soft team
defense letting them walk all over them 2nd half
there isnt one person to blame the offense was bad the defense was bad and for the 4th straight time we lost a coin flip game thats the mark of a bad football team
coaching too many damn penalties this game was going to be iced essentially but false starts fucked it up lol
marlon and peters have looked mediocre last 3 games
id say greg roman if i wasnt already blaming him every other fucking week

the secondary got beat like a drum today i get you had to sell out to stop henry but the poor tackling and not being anywhere close to assignments was awful you could sum up our season just off the brown td
interception late in the third we were killing that drive couldve walked into 4th quarter with ball and keep milking it
i am gonna say john harbaugh and i will take it a step furtherthis is what keeps him from being a top tier coach his teams are always good but always lack mental toughness since the ray lewised left i always feel like the team chokes when it matters the most remember aj green moments
secondary only one thumper back there and thats joker we try to strip the ball instead of tackling and it shows week after week
entire team failure minus derek wolfe snead dobbins and dez bryant

lamar queen judon humphrey peters 52 hollywood brown dj fluker entire team was trash
harbaugh the team chokes in the big games and has no heart this comes from the top

i think its time to look at a full coaching staff replace
either marcus peters or greg roman but imma go with peters motherfucker getting dusted on some of these plays and had the tackling ability of a jv highschool player
the entire fucking defense
harbaugh this doesnt look like a team that believes in themselves no heart thats coaching
phone the rest of this season in if they werent already doing that spam interior ol in the draft and go try to sign a wr who is a fucking adult because 25 years of history shows you clearly just cant draft or develop them
everyone but wolfe and dobbins
peters
eric decosta lamar and the receivers were horrible for sure but at the end of the day this is a team thats spending 125 million on defense and 56 million on offense and that dogshit defense at the end of the game is the result i dont care how many players are injured its just unacceptable for the defense to be this bad when it counts and if it is you might as well throw together a defense full of cheap veterans and rookies and actually give your franchise qb a half decent supporting cast
whoever decided a long pass was ideal in a 1st and 10 situation im pretty sure theres something in the football 101 book about basic play calling that pick doesnt happen tuckers fg is a game winning fg at worst
i blame that post on the steelers sub this is definitely a cosmic punishment worthy of the crime
everyone the team feels like it has no heart

i feel like we sold out gameplan for flashy moves corners refuse to play press coverage because they are trying to be 10 yds off to read and jump routes the oline gets beat weekly like they get a bonus for losing inches coaches abandon the run when it is working to try to give lbj throwing yards

everything needs reworked from the ground up
everyone but dobbins
coaches

penalties have cost us 3 games this season poor poor coaching
the yannick ngakoue curse is real
lamar jackson greg roman isnt the one missing easy throws stop making excuses for him
fucking secondary and lamar front 7 and dobbins did enough to win this game in regulation
harbaugh has had the same problems for years i really dont give two shits about our record without him gone were gonna get out coached plain and simple
lamar jackson at some point you have to stop making excuses and start making plays to win games he isnt right now
im just upvoting everyones suggestions tbh complete team failure
lamar jackson missed too many throws
lamar everyone blaming roman but hes not under center
lamar looks like a college player
if you dont think its patrick queen you have something wrong with your head
lamar
this is on the offense namely lamar d bottled up henry as long as they could had a chance in overtime and did nothing again
whole team except special teams
penalties
defense
pain
defensive backs

cant tackle cant cover to save their fucking lives

also greg roman needs to be fired yesterday
whole org members not named dobbins or tucker
entire defense
im going to say this in every thread until hes gone fire greg roman we dont need to run it up the middle every 1st fucking down
marcus peters
coaching
secondary

spent the whole game trying to strip the ball and instead gave up play after play
every fucking body
the whole defense cant pay them this much trade for players and still cant win the game when you are on the field
whole secondary this one not on lamar
secondary literally just the secondary chuck clark couldnt cover fucking shit marcus peters decided to play like a fucking amateur aj brown cut through them like a wet towel jesus fucking christ best practice of the season my ass this team doesnt deserve shit right now
where to start im gonna say tackling secondary play calls lj hollywood and queen
the whole team
coaching staff was abysmal today
the defense let the titans drive 80 yards at the end of the 4th couldnt tackle brown gave up the game winner to henry in ot
marcus peters he was in coverage on so many chunk plays in the 4th quarter
whole team
receivers and defense
the entire fucking team
shits embarrassing
everyone but jk dobbins

complete ass out on that field today

fire greg roman tell harbs his fucking job is on the line and get these players disciplined

so tired of wasting my time on a team that doesnt even fucking try to win games
me for believing that we could be competent
tackling
what is tackling is that a new thing
my fault i wore this lamar mvp shirt i got from my uncle last time i wore it was when i was at the playoff game in january
the baltimore ravens
offensive line is my vote every game we lose it wasnt good at the start of the year and the stanley and phillips injuries have sunk the season

that being said we win if the refs dont invent a rtp on mcphee to put the titans back in the game

the defense did a good job on henry through 3 quarters but the injuries to campbell and bwilly came back to bite us at the end
every single aspect of the team
everybody
marcus peters greg
greg roman
secondary that cant tackle for shit it will be defcon 5 if we lose 3 in a row to the fucking steelers on thanksgiving
the entire team and coaching staff shit the bed at various points today
the bad 3rd and 1 spot that was an obvious first down
greg roman the secondary mekari queen lamar harbaugh

this team has a worse record than the browns lmao
the ravens
the secondary

we held henry to a not terrible amount and we got burned by tannehill

honorable mention hollywood whats the point of having souljas if they cant fucking catch
the fucking defense just a refusal to tackle and the secondary was letting everything get caught unbelievable
team blame

welcome to third place

tucker was good
its hard to put it on the d when they are missing campbell and williams but the secondary looked like hell on the coverage and downfield tackling so them
the front office i cant imagine investing high draft picks and free agent signing into a defense that allows 90yard td drives
peters
who were the players who failed to tackle brown on 3rd and 10 clark peters and queen all of those guys
everyone but special teams

tackles are not a skill this defense has even heard of play calling has gone from uninspired to nonexistent our secondary refuses to even attempt to break up passes the same receivers are making the same catches back to back lamar is dropping back 10 yards before throwing 10 yard checkdowns receivers still forgetting how to play football and worst of all dumb fuck penalties always popping up at literally the worst possible moments every single game no lessons are being learned we are still making the exact same mistakes we were making in september everyone is adjusting to our gameplay except us
did hollywood even have a catch today
seriously what the fuck do you say to this game you were up 11 points had them on the ropes making it look like that they had overcome the last playoff game only to shit the bed like that in the end just disgusting someone gotta be talking in the locker room after this its just no acceptable you cant perform like this
front office this roster has more weaknesses than strengths many position groups have a weak link and not every position group has a strong link the plan to replace yanda is failing tavon young was clearly an ir hero type guy before we extended him today we learned that our wr group is more disappointments than secret weapons
secondary game should have been over but four guys missed tackles on aj brown and let him score a td the titans had no business scoring
gentlemen its time to accept the fact that this is a very mediocre football team as it stands as far as the blame i would say at this point there are simply too many to list
whole team

too many penalties again
secondary couldnt tackle against the titans again
defensive failures in a clutch moment again
roman taking dobbins in and out
secondary
the center for snapping the ball before dez was in spot marquise could have gotten a td or at least the first down
entire team coaches on down
patrick queen got pushed around on every single play you could grab a street fa to fill gaps better
love me lamar but hes been making some bad decisions and forcing to hollywood
defense

tackling or lack there of specifically i get that derrick henry is nearimpossible to tackle and take it with a grain of salt when its against him but holy shit they couldnt even tackle receivers
honestly theres no one o blame we arent that good its that simple if we dont make he playoffs this year i wont we mad lets get a good draft pick and tighten this up shed bad vet contracts and build a solid team i still love the team but lets adjust our expectations

we have no fight in us and we arent very discipline
the whole organization at this point wtf
everyone except dobbins and of course tucker
everybody specially the coaching staff
the baltimore ravens the whole organization from drafting another bust at wr to messing with the oline line up in the game defense not tackling offensive game execution everyone associated with the ravens except the wolf pack
i gotta say secondary and patrick queen
literally the entire team but dobbins defense ate shit when it mattered most wrs non existent as usual o line hella sus at times but not as bad as the d lamar another meh game but missing on some of those throws really fucking hurt

dont get me started on the coaches
whole team and whole staff special shoutout to our well paid secondary
interception to start the second half change the entire momentum a strong drive there up 2110 would of made it harder for the titans
derrick henry
the ravens organization
tackling and offensive playcalling
it was inexcusable how awful the defense tackled today but the offense was especially terrible with an 11 point lead the amount of unforced errorspenalties they continue to make is not a good reflection on the coaching
defense mainly dbs and roman crappy playcalls and taking dobbins out while hes hot

anyone saying lamar is full of it this week he had a couple bad throws but he has no one able to really contest catches
who even cares anymore
everyone to be honest
it has to be greg roman lamar had a number of excellent throws today including a td the pass to duvernay was questionable but he made a bum effort imo

that screen pass on 3rd and 16 in ot after winning the toss was mind blowing you cant stop henry and you know it so you basically give up in your own territory in ot unbelievable and this is after dialing up stupid bombs all game but dont do it when you actually have to

second after roman has to be petershumphrey they got burnt by brown all fucking game
bro they made lamar run a screen play on 3 and 17 like wtf
the whole team

cbs couldnt cover at all on browns ot catch humphrey was 5 yards behind him

romanrb coach ran twice in the second half with a two score lead took a deep shot with an 11 point lead took out dobbins as he was owning the game

lamar missed some big throws made some big ones too

wink sold out on blitzes far too much to cover for an injured dl

lbs some pretty terrible coverage of the tes second half tackling

special teams fake punt

harbaugh this team cant win close games if your players are going to be that undisciplined with penalties

when you lose a close game you probably did a lot right and they did but they also didnt do anything exceptionally well the big thing i noticed is the ravens could never get momentum
greg roman i just cant i want a big 64 receiver jk is taking over as rb1 and they ditched the run in the second half duvernay stopped running a route that led to a pick
everyone lmao
peters queen and hollywood
team loss john harbaugh were finding new ways to lose now and im not seeing what coach is doing to fix it penalties bad play calling boneheaded mistakes are all on the hc
offence turned it over on the arm punt and then could only score 3 again it was a total momentum killer and then the defence could not stop them defence played a good game but were too gassed to keep stopping them it was just a sad performance all around and we probably win that game if we had one of campbell or williams like the kc and pit games just needed one or two more plays to go our way
defense no sacks terrible db coverage felt like we were playing behind in q4 even when we led
team loss
secondary
secondary

winks scheming

romans scheming

brown

but overall another 100 yards in penalties including another batch of illegal formation and false starts that killed drives potentially to win at the end this is now squarely on harbs shoulders we are top3 in penalties in the league and are lucky we didnt lose a few other games due to penalties
hard to say oline dline no idea
defense
john harbaugh we stunk today
execution when it matters

whether its tackling getting lined up knowing the plays the ravens have simply just been sloppy when they cant afford to be false start on a 3rd and 1 qb sneak early snap on a screen that would have been an easy go ahead touchdown 3 defenders unable to tackle on a 3rd and 10 a sack on 2nd down in overtime just a to name a few instances throughout this game alone it can be seen in the past few games too

people like to blame the coachescoordinators and rightfully so the second half adjustments were not there this game but honestly i think its more of the players simply not executing when it matters i dont know whether its inexperience or jitters or whatever

and to pile it on were having an injury bug at the worse possible point in the season and its showing hopefully we can get healthy after this steelers game i have no hope for that game but if we can string together a nice streak after that we could be looking at sneaking into the playoffs but thats being optimistic
wink martindale he had 10 months to figure out how to not lose like we just did
is there a tackling coach that guy
peters for sure
coaches whoever in charge of developing wrs suck or maybe its the scouts idk

lamar has been a little off but hes the franchise qb and edc should invest in some weapons
john harbaugh if you cant figure out a way to make this talentedass team win then you deserve a 97 justmissedtheplayoffs type outcome
greg roman needs to hit bricks
patrick queen
can we give harbs some blame how many roughing the passers have we had like wtf its a guarantee every week we extend drives like that not to mention the many stupid ass penalties
greg roman
on a good note we know we can give hollywood browns snaps to dez bryant he has produced way more in 1 game today than hollywood has produced in a few this season
marcus peters he can barely cover and was bitched out on any of his tackle attempts the front 7 did a relatively good job at stopping henry how the hell does peters claim to be a all pro corner when corey davis breaks a 100 yards on you
whoever tf tried to tackle aj brown and didnt stick it
reminder that this marks the 4th distinct time that matt skura has absolutely choked in a critical moment honestly bench him for somebody who doesnt directly fuck at least one drive per game
the secondary i love me fruitpunch and juiceman but seemed like they were not present
roman get him the fuck out of baltimore
the entire god dang secondary if you had told me before the game with no brandon williams and calais campbell that derick henry would only hah rush for 133 yards i would be like sign me up secondary was absolutely horrendous peters humphrey clark elliot every titans receiver was always wide open think jimmy smith had an okay game but man best secondary in the league had an awful game
i blame covid and the lack of fans and of course roman and peters and humphrey and injuries
can we go with everybody but special teams again tucker didnt miss koch and cox were their usual selves and our coverage was good with a few great hits from justice hill
i love lamar and want to see him with better wrs but lets be honesthe struggles to make passes that other qbs make look easy its why he struggles to pass for over 200 yards consistently when guys like justin herbert are doing it every week lamars passes often sail over the wrs head when theyre open i dont wanna attack dude too hard because hes not being given a ton of help i blame this on the fo that refuses to spend money on the wr core and dumps cash into a defense that looks overrated every week with players that get beat more often than not its a coaching issue as much as it is a player execution issue its not just the players and its not just the coaches its a team collapse
offense lamar horrendous throws to wide open players mark andrews in particular
wrs miscommunication on routes duvernay but the boy is a stud and will learn chalked up to rookie mistake and dropped passes soulja brown
greg roman just when you think he committed to jk he was like hahahaha jk motha fuckas

defense entire defense that thought they were playing flag football

blame entire team
the entire team gets the blame for lack of heart we are missing that hell ya coach lets go for it on both sides of the ball this year the fact the titans came in to our house and disrespected our shield and harbaugh was the only one to get in their face about it shows everything about this team right now
and the nominees for the blamey are

1 the secondary for obvious reasons
2 hollywood brown for doing nothing
3 greg roman wink martindale for the weekly crap on coordinators
4 the teams spirit not being there my vote
the defense but id say marcus peters and marlon humphrey in particular
is it me or do a lot of the defensive players not try to tackle anymore they just try to strip the ball even if it means giving up an extra 5 yards in the process
peters and hollywood are the only ones i can say for sure did not do their job nobody had a great game but i feel everyone else played well enough to get us a w
lamar jackson he is leaving too many points on the board by missing wide open receivers and he will not last long in the nfl if he cant correct it
everyone they all fucking suck except tucker
every fucking one except dobbins and tucker
lamar and coaching once again bad decisions and bad throws at the worst times when it feels like we have the game in the bag we always pull out the red carpet for them with stupid ass shit defense too but it didnt have to come to that in the first place
in torn between lamar andrews might not have made that many mistakes but the few he made did hurt a fuck ton and our secondary
roman the offensive play calling is way too predictable the option plays arent tricking anyone and were designing passes for deep open receivers give the ball to your players and run the fucking ball more
greg roman needs to be gone you cant look at a 2110 lead as something you can sit on the ball for 25 minutes and still win
marcus peters is a joke player should nicknamed 50 percent seriously dude doesnt try play 15 yards off let them catch it and then let them run by because he doesnt like tackling
can we fire roman and cut or bench ingram hill hollywood
greg roman

how do you not grind away a 4th quarter lead on the ground with your rb that has been extremely effective all game
i have been a lifelong fan the team is a year younger than me lol but this year is even more frustrating than post 12 and even kyle boller years injuries are absolutely no excuse and i hate that excuse the steelers are consistently a good team even with injuries ie last year the raiders have tons of injuries and are getting better as the season progresses injuries are no excuse and i hate to say it but i think it is finally time to look at harbaugh maybe ed reed and some past players were right about harbaugh after all that he is just a players coach harbaughs only good teams when he did not have 3 hof defenders on his team were last season and maybe 2015 just think for a second picture this young ravens team with a coach like reid tomlin mcvay gruden shit i would even say vrabel i think you would see the appropriate changes being made most coaches dream of a talented team like the ravens have sorry for the long post but as a life long fan of this team its just frustrating to see the fucking legendary talent we have had in this franchise but we can never do anything with it harbaugh bellichick tomlin carroll payton are all longest tenured head coaches now you cannot honestly tell me harbaugh deserves that more than any of those other coaches besides maybe payton
lamar huge interception and some overthrows just not getting it done when he needed to
hands down lamar jackson is the reason we lost had four drives in a row he could have ended the game with a td and didnt hopefully ravens fo is realizing we cant sign this guy to a 40 million dollar deal he is loosing games for us
greg roman
we were leading until our defense got drained i blame roman and offense play calling we keep the offense on the field longer we win this
roman hollywood and lamar in that order
im sick of harbaughs stale ass messages alreadyget him tf out already we literally choke in every big game
its timejohn needs to go im sick of this choir boy bullshit
john harbaugh this is on him
greg roman
greg mother fucking roman
greg roman predictable and terrible play calling in big spots missing calais and b will did not help
greg roman
greg roman and marcus peters
how about mark andrews stupid 1hand attempt at a catch
i made a post right after the loss to titans last year saying lamar has been figured out and our oc sucks and we rely on hollywood and andrews too much and all you cry babies got mad well looks like im still right bench lamar and get better receivers cause we suck right now we are 64 with dolphins and cardinals i mean we went from 142 to 64 already i love the team but horrible choices and overrated players
who gives a fuck
greg roman fire him
removed

what else is new ive given up emotionally this year and its more enjoyable theyre still a great team to watch but man oh man dont get invested

big changes need to come this off season terrible showing this season
just goes to show we really blew it last january

i think of everything that went right last year no major injuries tons of momentum the swagger

lets pack it in get a high 1st round pick wr off the board draft some oline help and shake up the coaching staff for next year its up to bisciotti and edc now
we gon cry this one out together fam
playoffs are seriously doubtful this year im not expecting them to win enough games to get wild card
not even angry just sad
im gonna need a whole lot of liquor on thanksgiving if we play like this again
drinking alone at home have to get up at 6 am yea pain fuck the titans
ok what team do you want to be a fan of now

we know
posts like this are the reason we have a post game thread
removed
removed
this team is going nowhere this season just another disappointment for 2020
ok what team do you want to root for now

fairweather fans dont come on to forums to talk about the team we deserve criticism because we arent winning while we did well to stop henry today until the last play the cost of that was their wrs feasting right now we have too many injuries and generally bad players on the oline to be a good team we are headed for 106 or 97
is this sarcastic or are you stupid lol because there is nothing wrong with criticizing our team we have holes we need to fill but the people saying out season is doomed are the bandwagons
is this sarcasm
is this sarcastic everyone can see there is room for improvement
ive been a fan for 15 years and always will no matter what but this was embarrassing today we gave the game away dumb penalties on 3rd and long flase start on qb sneak 3 and out in ot we did everything possible to lose
this is a trash take my god can we stop acting like someone is fair weather for watching their team struggle and being disappointed should we bury our head and act like it isnt happening

we are not playing well i have been watching since 1996 and have seen worse but that doesnt seem excuse poor play now
you also can say people are dumb for not seeing the sarcasm as it was not at all clear nor did you use the s flag it is often impossible to determine tone from written language
are you on crack
nobody needs this sarcastic bullshit rn

shut the fuck up
im pretty disappointed in marquise brown he had 0 yards this game and is our number one receiver
tweeting takes a lot of energy out of your hands
reminder hollywood brown was drafted before aj brown i dont think hollywood is bad but tweeting about his lack of usage while completely fucking disappearing really pisses me the fuck off fuck you soulja
whats the point of having souljas if they never catch never
i hope we dont pick up his 5th year option this dude bulked up in the offseason and somehow got worse
andrews is our 1 receiver by far what are you talking about then probably snead
to this day i will keep saying the ravens shouldve taken aj brown or dk with their pick or at least used a later pick for dk
whats the point of having souljas if they cant catch
crazy he tweets about not being used and drops wide open passes i hate to say it but we may have drafted another bust
he better not cry about getting passes anymore i wish we had drafted aj brown or dk metcalf this dude hollywood isnt a 1 receiver
apparently posting instagrams playing catch in your back yard is a lot easier than actually catching a ball in an nfl game
he sucks hes a number 2 at best
decosta deserves way more heat than he is getting specifically for this pick he thought hollywood was tyreek hill but he definitely is not even close cant fathom looking at hollywood and then at metcalf and taking hollywood i know metcalf had injury history but so did hollywood monumental wiff as of right now
bust
hollywood is a good player he just isnt a fit for how this offense is being run
sunday trade him for a 5th
hes just not a wr 1 and thats okay we need an alpha on the outside luckily this 2021 draft is loaded with wr talent it love to see seth williams out of auburn come in
he shouldnt even be a 1 the man wasnt even 1 at oklahoma but yet we took him off the board as if we had a 1 to pair him with our problem at drafting wrs should be pretty clear at this point well want one of if not the fastest guy in the draft regardless of actual intangibles to go along with it
i think greg is partially at fault also hollywood is a 43 reciever and he didnt magically get slower im sure some plays could be drawn up that utilize his speed
think he needs to stick to being a twitch streamer
he fucking sucks i meani dont really have takes besides that you watch him and you just get the sense that he is no feel for the game
when brown said the souljas comment he wasnt just talking about himself yall loved snead getting targets last week yall love when duvernay gets more targets yall love when dobbins gets all these carries but yall still think he was talking shit like this is exactly what he was talking about feed the players that make plays he was telling the coaches exactly what weve been saying and yall niggas hate him for it because he had a couple rough games tell me how that makes sense
cut him fr
he should be inactive on thursday
everytime we lose its dont over react this dont overreact that can we now 64 outside the playoffs 3rd in the division blew a 2110 lead i think its time to panic someone please tell me why i should overreact i beg you because this fucking sucks
its almost like we need to tell greg roman to fuck off or tell harbaughbisciotti he needs to fire him
hey kids listen for a sec the second most important player on our entire team after lamar is ronnie stanley when brown has to slide across and we start activating scrapheap guys that will cost us games when boyle goes down leaving us with one professional te we and our teheavy system will struggle on offense

the offense will look bad with the ol so badly disrupted and without boyle it just will

on defense without bwill and campbell the anchors and the best two players on the line our defensive front is weak meaning lbs will be more in the box which means the cbs will be more exposed

go ahead and panic if you want but if you thought we wouldnt feel the pain of all the injuries today you were wrong
we arent a fucking playoff team man were mediocre as hell defense gets absolutely shredded when it matters and gives up an 11 point lead and offense cant do shit when it really counts ever the offense just looks ridiculously uncreative nobodys ever open the only completions come off ridiculous lamar throws we dont ever have easy shit like the tits had for tannehill jk was good but fuck this run for 1 yard on 1st down shit ik people are gonna say be positive youre not a true fan but were literally going nowhere until we fire roman these losses dont even hurt me anymore the second we went 3 and out up 5 i knew we were losing cuz the offense fucking sucks ass
no its well past time to overreact these issues are on film every week those motherfuckers who were so happy that we were 62 failed to see the forest here we are not great at any positional group outside of qb and even that is looking iffy its time for wholesale changes
changes need to be made asap not sure if its roman or harbaugh at this point season was over when stanley went on ir but that effort level in the second half from the defense was an absolute joke
this one stung hate to see the blown lead and i really cant stand the titans

but if youre really looking for a bright side our last 5 games are all shouldwin games so we could even potentially drop one thursday to the steelers and finish 115

we all want better than that and we shouldve won today just so im clear but we finish off with cowboys browns jags giants bengals
youve got some mad recency bias overreact if you must but as a longtime ravens fan im in my natural habitat
anyone that says you cant react art any point is being dumb this sub is hyper sensitive to lamar criticism so it boils over to any criticism

the reality is that we arent a good team at this point to many injuries and too little imagination from coaching staff
lamar doesnt look good enough honestly
dudes danced on our logo then beat us in our house because we couldnt finish this aint the year lmao take this l of a season and grow from it also i dont wanna hear shit about our winning record got dick slapped by the chiefs couldnt close vs the steelers or the titans lost to the worst patriots team ive seen since i had a cognitive memory then beat a bunch of bums
ball so soft university smh
i dont understand why we dont just run the damn ball

we stacked the team with rushing threats for a reason we have 3 bona fide stud running backs in ingram dobbins and bradley justice hill is no slouch either we have a wr in duvernay that kills it in sweep runs and our qb is ridiculously dangerous running the ball yet today we call 5050 toss ups to a 59 wr that should be running slants and crossing routes and dialing up long pass plays that dont have time to develop behind a banged up oline when were protecting a lead in the second half we do the same thing when we go down early in a game i love lamar but he isnt peyton manning and hollywood isnt randy moss and thats not how the baltimore ravens win football games

run the damn ball
its literally romans fault and out defense needs an on field leader bc 4424 clearly arent cutting it in the secondary


aaaah so desperately frustrating
this is just baltimore getting back to what they do best letting us down every week and continuing to find new ways to be an embarrassment really thought we turned a corner last season nope
id rather be hopeful and look forward to ravens games then just fucking hate my life every sunday so im not gunna overreact plus anything can happen if you make it to the playoffs just look at 2012 we were shit then too and we still pulled it off
logical fans have known for two months that this team is not good its the ones who have the purple glasses on who thought wed be 133 this year every time someone would try to say how bad the team was they would be destroyed on here for not being a fan
i may be in the minority here but i have always thought harbaugh has sucked at clock management and in particular managing timeouts he wastes challenges on plays we wont win all the time today was the most amazing installment though challenge a play lose a timeout false start incomplete pass punt that shows me a lot about how he approaches the game as a coach and how unprepared the team is mentally

overall though its not a one person problem getting rid of harbaugh or roman or any other one person wont fix what has become a systemic problem of a lack of discipline and focus maybe that starts and ends with the head coach maybe not
i think that the team we saw today would be lucky to finish 500 on the season dont know if thats an overreaction or not but i genuinely dont know if they will win more than two more
fire greg roman now we get in a deficit and cant ever come back i know we dont have williams or campbell but were better then this plus the stupid penalties kill us every game
fire roman get rid of soulja boy attempt to get some better wrs
the nfl schedule give you plenty of chances to redeem yourself its even more so this year with 7 playoff spots per conference
because now its not overreacting its reacting over reacting would be staying we have no chance reacting is knowing its a long shot but still putting your trust in the team its a longshot for us to make the playoffs but i believe this team can win if some major changes are made
seeing multiple plays where even with a decimated line lamar has upwards of 3 seconds to throw and nobody is open is indicative of how atrocious the play calling is

if your receivers cant create space on their own its your job as offensive coordinator to call plays to get them open time and time again roman fails to do this its ridiculous
no because it isnt a overreaction it wasnt an overreaction last week either were dropping easily winnable games and it has affected our playoff chances drastically weve got a few tough games coming up and tbh well be lucky if we win any of them

our playoff chances are fading fast and have been for a couple weeks now
i dont know but it seems week after week we are getting out coached both sides of the ball thats a head coach problem
yes you can just know that you were still annoying when you overreacted three weeks ago
in 2006 the new orleans saints finished 106 got the 2 seed in the nfc playoffs and got all the way to the conference title game where they promptly got blown out they then failed to make the postseason for the next two years didnt even have a winning season either year they then went on to win the super bowl in 2009 eleven years later i think things turned out ok for them

the point is we dont know how these things will unfold im sure there were people panicking in 2005 or 2007 when we had down years but we made it out just fine best to take a zenlike approach to these thing and accept them for what they are yes were all disappointed that they didnt win today and yes things are looking grim for a playoff spot if we dont start taking care of business but the story of this year and this franchise isnt over lets see how things play out
with the jagsgiantscowboys and bengals on our schedule i still see us making 1011 wins on the season and i had us at 115 or 124 for the season at the start that being said we dont look like a good football team and i cant see us doing much of anything if we manage the playoffs
im kinda new to football but does this now mean we cant go to the playoffs no matter what
thats what happens when your wr core is full of midgets and your oline sucks
just wrecked by injuries but some changes need to be made on offense like accepting that hollywood might be the fourth of fifth best receiving option on the team and get more snaps to dez snead and duvernay
i think so
even if we luck out fire roman and get a good offensive coordinator hell just be stolen by another team looking for a head coach this will happen as long as harbaugh is here with a coach that doesnt have a system we will always need to get lucky with both the offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator
we can react or we can just take it one day at a time im not happy about this game either dobbins is the only one who showed up with actual desire to play lets see what happens on thursday seasons can change very quickly
after the steelers the ravens play five games the opponents include

the worst defense in the league dallas

the second worst defense in the league jax

the 24th worst defense in the league bengals

the 20th worst defense in the league cle
if thats what makes you happy then go for it
once we lose this thursday the season will be over because making the wild card will be almost impossible without significant help from other teams
i think its fair to say its ok to panic
its not overreacting any more were outside looking in to the playoffs right now after 11 weeks and playing undefeated steelers on short rest this team is in trouble
im not overreacting we lost to some really good teams and by just one score
im pretty sick of the people saying were over reacting and bringing up the 2012 season as if our team is anything like the 2012 team lol idk i love this team but we just arent cutting it this year and we have major problems that continue to make themselves known i dont get the people who basically say that it doesnt matter and to just be glad were still going positive
i think the time to start worrying is coming i dont know if i believe in the ravens making the playoffs or not but i do know i am open to the idea of starting to worry
honestly im just really glad that no matter how bad my mentality can be it wont really affect the team i can say ravens bad all i want but im not in the drivers seat
let me understand your rant
the same offense that had jackson an mvp is now trash because jackson cant read a defense because jackson isnt accurate

perhaps there is a long view by the coaching staff to work jackson through bumps in his game
after all the online has not done a good job blocking all season losing two pro bowl linemen has been tough defenses dont need to blitz to be all over jackson this year
dont overreact ever because its a damn game
64 through 10 games is miles better than 46
6 more games leftlet the season finish never forget the giants beating the pats in 20082012

reg season records for giants in both of those years

106 and 97

lfg

it takes failure to find the path of a champion
there shoulnt be an overreaction if you adjust expectations accordingly this didnt look like a super bowl team after week 3 and subsequent performances and injuries have only confirmed that performances need to improve and coaching will be addressed in the offseason but im just going to enjoy the ride at this point
yes and no

yes bc the offense still hasnt formed a consistent identity andrews with 7 targets brown with 3 dez with 5 snead with 7 dobbins had 17 touches while gus and ingram had 5 carries

yes bc its clear that andrews is our only respectable skill player brown has been so disappointing this year boykins didnt see a target yesterday

no bc we finally saw lamar take a few more deep shots this needs to keep happening

no bc were missing campbell and williams against the worst possible team to miss them even then the run defense did well despite this

no bc the oline wasnt that bad despite all the changes and injuries

this offense is still a mess and the defense was missing its two most important players the good news is that this the type of team that can get hot for 4 games in the playoffs
giants fan with minimal bias here

lamar is not a bigtime qb hes good enough to get you wins against bad teams but he will always choke in high pressure situations and he relies on his athleticism rather than his brain and arm to get yards he is rg3 if rg3 hadnt exploded his knee
the reason you shouldnt panic is because we have a slim chance to make it to the play offs and zero chance to win once we get there its pointless to panic this is what we will be as long as harbaugh is the head coacha little better than average
no because its a game

i dont feel like he was bad this game or last game tbh
i swear its like we find a new way to lose these past few weeks something is off with this years group last year we were so efficient in the red zone and our offense could be counted on to finish games idk if its confidence scheme or what but this team needs a lot to change and as much as i love lamar hes gotta stop with the bad turnovers
havent had good play calling since kubiak
we had an identity on offense last year smashmouth football and then hit em with playaction this year we tried to turn lj into a pocket passer not working if it wasnt broke why mess with it
on defense too many injuries and a bunch of 1st yr starters and players in their 1st year with this defensive scheme
but the main reason for all this retirement of yanda plain and simple
romans red zone playcalling is buttcheeks this dude gotta be fired
the efforts of the ravens is embarrassing everyone is looking like burnt toast and no one finishes tackles the offender is boring and predictable why even use a first round pick on guys whos never going to be used as a guy with yac when hes undersized harbaughs a great coach but the effort by everyone is disgusting dont tell me that the ravens played well the offensive play calling is embarrassing lamar is playing great hes the only one that wants to win
there is so little heart on this team on either offense or defense you dont have players like ray or ssr to light some fires these dudes simply go through the motions when things go against them
looks like guys have given up i saw bad effort and guys getting complacent with a lead
the browns officially have a better record than us never thought id see a season where the browns can make the playoffs and we cant i went from being excited about thanksgiving night to now dreading it
thursday will make or break our season i have zero confidence we will win
if we blow through the steelers on thursday well win the fucking super bowl
what a story it would be to go from 3rd in the division to making it to the super bowl call me delusional but i believe
that would be a terrible idea lol fuck

and now we are going to have to try hard to barely make wildcard
its not even him the effort of any players this game besides lamar has been garbage stopping halfway through routes peters giving davis 8 yards of space every play everyone just played like garbage and their effort was garbage play calling is predictable even as a viewer and our former first round pick doesnt even get used harbaughs a great coach i dont expect the ravens to change coaching i just expect them to look at this game and tell themselves that they deserved to lose because they clearly have no shit at the end of the game the whole defense started pointing fingers at the end of the game the tackling on the lead changing td by brown was the epitome of how the ravens wanted to lose the game

isnt the run game

its the deep passing game

deep throws to the right they are 543 for 123 yds 1 td 2 ints that isnt a typo 43 attempts 5 completions

they are much better throwing deep down the middle but they rarely do it

ebron has been their best deep target not claypool
100 this offense was able to run the ball earlier in the year against a few decent defenses in large part because they hadnt gotten wise to the steelers passing attack yet plus the passing attack has become even more condensed since then

i was watching the condensed game of the eaglessteelers game yesterday because i was curious to see what the steelers looked like at their best against a decent defense and its nightandday from what weve seen the last month or so two plays in particular highlighted it for me

1 on a 3rd and 11 in the second quarter the steelers were in 11 personnel but ebron was off the line as a wr all four receivers ran routes that carried them past the sticks they convert on a 13 yard curl route to claypool to the field side i had timed snaptothrow because i couldnt believe my eyes 224 seconds you can run routes that take you further than 6 yards down the field without waiting feeling like youre hanging your qb out to dry
2 the claypool touchdown that seals it first the claypool part of the play 229 snaptothrow 29 yards travelled in the air from the line of scrimmage again you can push the ball without exposing your qb the other big thing washington and juju both run routes that are 10 yard down the field and washington is plenty open as well

the rushing offense wasnt good in this game but it was good enough because it provided a semblance of balance the point about deepintermediate passing is 100 right and the offensive line is not the impediment that people think it is you can get receivers upfield and open quickly without exposing your qb in pass protection you can give yourself better options and chances on thirdandlong you can force safeties and lbs to have their first move be reading and not just crashing downhill

thank you for coming to my ted talk
i think we gotta get creative too i think chase could be effective in the slot instead of purely outside also diontae gets crazy separation so seeing him go out vertical could be effective and i mean jesus we finally sent juju more vertical against buffalo and it worked but instead we are so infatuated with sending him on 4 yard routes every play

youre right about middle of the field tho we went 22 and 1 td when attacking the middle and yet for some reason we dont take it when defenses show single high ben has to take advantage of that
its extremely hard to argue that having a run game wouldnt open up that passing game in every facet
foly huck i agree with you on something

i have been wondering where the deep shots have been what happened to claypool ben isnt even giving his guys opportunities down the field that used to be his thingno risk it no biscuit ala arians

defenses have keyed in on the short passing game yet ben isnt willing to test them deep to make them play on their heels even a little bit im curious to see how many of those 43 attempts came in the first 8 games vs the last 5 games im wondering if bens knee is a bigger issue than we know thats why hes not chunking it deep to give his guys a shot

along with all of this firing the oc wouldnt change a thing all it would do is cause a distraction likely piss off ben

lastly this is by far where most of my frustration is coming from but the batted balls at the los are directly related to defensive lines knowing its going to be a quick short throw half of the batted balls are coming with 23 rushers 12 faux rushers dropping out its certainly not like he needs to rush the ball out of his hand seems like bad reads on bens part to me even more so because hes in shotgun so he knows whos dropping whos rushing he should know immediately he can afford an extra 12 seconds to let the deeper routes develop when the defense is only rushing 3 dropping some out to get their hands in his short passing lanes

frustrating stretch from the offense but the talent is there to get on track again im just hoping they can do so in the next 3 games so theyre rolling come january
im gonna weather the downvotestorm here but i think bens arm is mostly shot couple that with receivers dropping passes and youre looking at an ineffective offense
his deep ball accuracy has been in decline for years to his credit i think he understands this and is making the decision to be more game manager avoid risks as much as possible

i dont think he has to go deep more than occasionally just throw beyond 10 yds a littlel more frequently
two questions if you dont mind of course

1 why focus solely on the right i assume for ease of analysis which is fair enough
2 why not incorporate dpi into the analysis it wont change the stats considerably but i think any play where dpi is called should be considered successful for the offense drawing pass interference is a skill albeit one that wont likely help you as much in the playoffs as calling is more lax generally but a skill nonetheless to be clear i dont want to see the steelers play james harden ball any more than anyone else but drawing fouls and taking advantage of rules is as much a part of gamesmanship as anything else
right i heard lolly and williamson saying this on snr yesterday the short passing game is drawing in defenders that also make the running game less effective

i hope the fichtner and ben are playing the long con and will blind side the opposition in the playoffs with deep passes
agreed that not being able to throw downfield has caused the offensive failure but it begs the question why cant they throw longer routes

bens knee is definitely an issue but i dont think it is the only one seems like there are a lot of things we just dont do schematically like your mention of not throwing deep middle that make us easy to defend i think those are ben and randy game planning issues
the o line is too shot to throw deep against a lot of teams but i believe we need to to try it this week to keep the threat of the deep pass alive
im not trying to throw ben out still want him to play but if his knee is really bugging him sit him the last three weeks we are in the playoffs who cares if we have to go on the road the whole postseason in covid times get ben healthy
agree the wft and then subsequently the bills were able to stick all 11 defenders in a short field and our inability to be effective over the top gave 0 room to expand the offense its why the run game has gotten considerably worse
cant throw to ebron if he drops everything with his twitter fingers get claypool more involved then just with jet sweeps and deep passes to try and get a pi call i could be wrong and might need our analyst for this one but to me from the naked eye it looks like we play better we hes involved in the passing game a good bit
its the oline in general its bad
theres an excellent analysis of this with film over on btsc you have two different philosophies canadaben merged initially and each individually solved as the back half of the season has unfolded
for me the biggest issue offense is randy we all know he is shit but to defend him

o line is shit
no running game
super predictable now with short passes
no play action
ben dosent even drop back or ever runs
almost 0 ben extending plays
and drops

i mean we are predictable as fuuuuuck
deep sideline incompletions piss me off we call them so much and 543 isnt worth it

although we do get some good pi from it
no its the offensive line and any other answer is foolish


this draft is an a just off the rb chuba hubbard that jersey gonna sell like hot cakes
getting pick 86 in exchange for moving back 11 spots in the third round seems awfully rich to me but i like the idea of trading back often to get as many picks in the top 100 as possible team is about to hemorrhage talent in free agency so you want to load up as much as possible

id be thrilled to get slater and humphrey in the first two rounds thats a pair of versatile ol players who you can plug in where you need them immediately and also secure options at lt and c long term dont know much about the other guys but the positions look right to me
chubba hubbard aint gonna be there at 86
im really curious about najee harris and if he will be available to us
creed humphrey is gonna be taken in the first round
how the hell do you do 7 round drafts i can only do 3
chiba goes to my fav college hes elusive but not a big power back
i saw a mock draft that had us taking travis etienne id definitely like to see that we need a capable hb

thank you for this people are always so focused on negatives and honestly the negatives are people overreacting about things that arent even bad with the way he interacts with the community he will be walter payton man of the year material in the years to come
he does a lot of things outside of football and he has been the only player on offense the past 3 weeks to actually do something and not make mistakes and people want him gone
with all the heat juju has taken this week i want to remind everyone that hes proven time and time again to be a wonderful addition to the community i cant believe people actually want him gone
dionte johnson was at burlington and was gonna pay off some bills too but kept dropping this credit card and couldnt complete the transaction i kid i kid

on a serious note thats awesome of juju to do major props
man what an asshole we shouldnt resign him s
nah dance man bad he dance so that make me mad
love that kid
juju sent me a surprise inspirational message when i was in icu with stage 4 heart failure and total heart block things looked grim but it put more hope in me i was 44 and im a lifelong steelers fan juju is so much larger than just an nfl great if everyone lived life like juju the world would be a better place i hope he stays a steeler but ill be his fan no matter where he plays hes so unselfish so rare in a wr
im no steelers fan but you gotta like juju
he should be at home studying film and working out 247 not being a positive role model in the community s
but he dances on other teams logos cut him
juju is a good dude the people who want him gone are just blowing hot air hes a good player and does a lot of good things for the community he makes us a better team period
im sure jujus family used layaway often as a child so he know just how important what he did is to those families
juju is one of the people who gets hate for no reason all because he makes tik toks if lamar made tik toks people would love it ive never heard any bad stories about juju only ever good stories of him helping his commmunity
yeah but he did a tiktok dance on the bills logo so hes clearly the worst
rnfl and half this sub too apparently
first dancing now this no wonder our offense sucks s
such a stand up guy glad hes a steeler
this is why hes my favorite
he is a class act
juju is such a great person i hope he gets a new oc and teammate that can catch when he is in triple coverage
keep him and let him go deep again
i dont understand how layaway is still a thing the whole point was to make a purchase when you dont have cash on hand and need an atm now we have credit cards and debit cards and dont use cash how did layaway not go the way of blockbuster pagers and slap bracelets

i dont get it if youre saying were defeated youre a week and a half late
just curious how people would feel if we traded for him or joining the org if the jets let him go
nice try sam darnold
another sam darnold postno
he needs to be away from adam gase and it would be interesting to see him get a shot with a good organization with that said i wouldnt want him on the steelers unless randy is gonezo and they hire a more capable oc
i dont know maybe check the 100 other posts asking the same exact question
would rather have ryan fitzpatrick
wish we could afford stafford
if ben retires unlikely but not impossible he may legitimately be our best available option which is slightly terrifying sure hasnt looked good this season but the jetsadam gase factor warrants him getting another opportunity with a better team certainly would prefer it to going into the season with either rudolph or dobbs as starter god forbid
if you bleed black and gold i mean truly bleed black and goldyou know theres no chance on gods green earth this every happens and the thought would never enter your mind
im beginning to think that this is a fucking joke its literally every day theres a darnold post
if you are curious just look through this subs history because this question is asked once or twice a week
you ever used the search function on reddit before
umm no please
reset the clock
610 would bang
im going to start a chain

hell no just like it was hell no last week when this was posted and the week before and the week before that and also the week before that and even the week before that
i feel the same as the last half dozen times this question was asked
nah were rolling with mason after ben nothing to worry about here dont even mention qb its not a problem
the post with the mock draft reminded me of najee harris and how much im hoping hes a steeler anyone following college football have any insight on him will he be available to us round 1 or 2


no point in drafting a rb so high rather get a lineman in the first round not a flashy choice but its what we need
he will be gone in the first round we arent getting him unless we trade up

najee harris is expected to be the next derrick henry

in reality if we dont fix our offensive line offensive playcalling and probably move to a new coordinator for both offense and line no back is going to succeed in pittsburgh right now
if he aint there in round 4 then ill pass they need offensive line help bad though there are scheme issues most of the line is getting old and there are some really good linemen in this draft that lt from oregon i think and the center from ohio or georgia
javonte harris from unc is the perfect fit in pittsburgh
honestly if chuba is there in the 2nd i wouldnt even be mad if the steelers picked him up his style of running would fit perfectly for the steelers run scheme or at the very least do the best out of the rbs

though i cant get a read on how they feel about their current stable of rbs they got 5 of em 1 whose only a pass catcher 2 who are in the wrong scheme for their skill set a practice squad guy edmunds and a rookie who has amazing speed but the game hasnt slowed down for him if they do pick up another one at least 3 of these guys got to go

also this isnt a slight at conner i think hes a good rb when hes he is this year and a scheme that fits his style better imo i think he do better in a scheme similar to the titans
i agree on the ol need my thinking is we can get some solid guys in round 2 and 3 or in 1 then a rb in 2 i like dotson banner and chuks alot hoping we have pouncey one more year and we can grab a center following draft

with ben most likely gone after next year it would be great to have star rb again that can either help a young qb or assist a vet as we find the next franchise qb

ben 37 drops 521 att 71

stafford 29462 62

ryan 28498 56

rodgers 27448 6

brady 27497 54
id really want to see it as a percentage drops per attempt with our nonexistent run game hes throwing a ton
half those have to be in like the last 3 games
thats almost as many as ab had in his time here in 8 years ab only had 39 drops
its worth noting that the 37 number is official drops which doesnt include anything even remotely contested probably more like 50 drops in reality
im sure johnson and ebron make up about 30 of those
an even crazier stat in that list is that davante adams has been targeted 118 times this season and doesnt have a drop so all 27 of rodgers drops are from every other receiver thats wild
8 more passes dropped than the next closest qb with this amazing we are 112
wow the nfc needs receivers poor ben
mark this nsfw please
id like to see some stats on tipped balls at the los

i think the lack of the deep ball threat is harming both the run game and the passing game

defenses dont need to play a deep cover can crowd the line and help the d backs at the same time

defenses arent respecting any deep threats receivers dont seem to be getting open on intermediate and deep balls defense can cover 15 yards of territory
our wideouts need to start using elephant jizz for better gripage
jesus horacio christ thats insane
and it feels like most of those 37 drops were in the last 45 games
but its ben thats the problem s
how many drops come from diontae johnson and ebron
thats so depressing
aye now give him credit quite a few of them passes might be on him statistically but we all know hes put a lot of throws right on target and his receivers couldnt hold on to it ben aint the most accurate but he also didnt throw so inaccurate that it was the cause of 37 drops terrible stat line honestly
all dimes too

lets hope they have a great game on monday
hes easily our most explosive player on offense we need him to be catching balls hopefully cincy is a good tune up game for the colts and browns and he is in better form heading into the postseason

thats not what you want to hear at this point in the season defenses have figured our offense out and unwillingness to adjust will be our downfall
yeah thats not encouraging this offense has been stagnant for weeks now and yes we have all seen the drops plays are being left on the field but its also that every team we play knows the game plan now and are keying on those quick passes duh until this team shows a willingness and a capability to throw downfield the offense will continue to disappoint its as simple as that

hopefully someone in the org has the balls to relay that message to ben because it doesnt seem like he is getting it
shaun sarrett is not getting the job done the line looks terrible in their zone blocking coordination and the power pullscounters lack any kind of timing all of a sudden our line is old bloated and a negative to getting wins with all the injuries maybe its time to give ramon a call
meh
look im no football expert or anything i wouldnt qualify as an armchair quarterback cause the last time i actually played organized football was flag football as a kid and i was fucking clueless

but could it maybe possibly potentially be the playcalling that presents a major obstacle for the offense

i could be wrong but when i can tell what play is coming up more often than not based a few things like field position formation down and yardage to the 1st im gonna guess the guys on the other side of the field have a much better clue of what is about to happen than me

would a new offense coordinator or at the very least playcaller be considered a drastic adjustment i dunno do you consider not running a quarterback sneak on 4th and goal with less than a yard to go after getting stuffed three times on the same play great playcalling
if you dont adjust we wont win anymore games ben there is a problem with this offense and if you dont see it we are lost
well time to call your bookies and take the bengals looks like were getting the same offense again this week
its more than the ol its the oc

freejameswashington
i agree but james isnt a 3 yard drag receiver either he has to be willing and able to push the ball downfield to him it doesnt seem like he can do that consistently
then why is diontae johnson on the field instead of the sideline lol
big ben 2019 washington has to make those plays its on him to pull that ball in on a big shot like that

fans 2019 why would he throw washington under the bus like that

big ben 2020 washington should be on the field you cant let guys sit on the sideline who could potentially help you

fans 2020 sing it big ben
yeah ben except washington did nothing except for his td catch im sick of hearing ben cry about washington not being on the field and im sick of fans acting like washington is some magic cure for the offense
ben shouldnt talk about playing time for wrs at all hes not a coach this just exemplifies why our offense sucks

then please throw the ball further than 3 yards down field
regardless i will continue to have a panic attack anytime big ben even seems to be remotely reaching for his elbow i dont care which one or even if its his elbow he could be putting a bandage on his sons elbow for a tiny scrape and i would still have a panic attack
maybe we can actually see some results that back that up then
what were seeing now is noodle arm manning on the broncos when their defense carried them to the super bowl ben isnt as bad yet its clear that hes regressing and will probably only be here for another year
maybe practicing once or twice a week would help too its not like the pre2000s where qbs got hit in practice or theyre wearing pads every day timing with his wrs is clearly suffering with him only showing up for walkthroughs at the end of the week
his elbow is good what about his knees

wait did people think hes retire mid year tf
this is like bens version of rodgers saying relax
dont worry the short passes is all part of the game plan when playoffs come we will be scoring 40 points every game we gonna surprise the shit out of teams i hope and pray to god
theres 0 chance they let him go next year either with the insane amount of dead money itd cause if you want to retire its gonna be after the 2021 season big guy
im just over here nervous we are probably going to play the ravens for the third time
how dumb u gotta be to want ben to retire lol did anyone watch last year
last time ben said he should retire was that jags game after that the steelers went on to win 8 in a row
who wants him to retire ill fight you
this team sure is special just not sure its of the good kind lol
so hes not gonna pull an andrew luck
as a stupid qb with on a shitty team once said relax

the anniversary of me screaming we finally beat these mother fuckers in front of my young nieces
straight into my veins
remember screaming so loud for this one i scared my girlfriends dog took him a few days to come back around to me

was also my computer wallpaper for months afterwards
i was there this was one of my favorite football moments ive seen live
this was such a relief after witnessing the loss from the previous year
look at all of the people
i cherish this moment so much because its only one of two wins we have against these bastards in the past decade pain

take my upvote
this was a good day
i would like to forget that epic collapse of a season thank you
what a beautiful photo
i was at this game with my family father in law bought us all tickets this year i got him and myself this signed picture
is there a video
iirc we were coming off of a few losses this season going into this game i was so happy we got a w and against the team i hate the most
i forgot this was a color rush game thats just beautiful
i was at this game this moment and the final 4th down incompletion were the loudest ive ever heard heinz field probably my favorite game since ive been a fan
i was at this game it was my 35th birthday it was so loud the whole have and the energy at heniz field was crazy i lost my voice for about a week
damn 2 years already
on the other end of the spectrum wanna guess what happened three years ago
i was india so i couldnt catch the game but man what a great birthday gift to see that they won that game
ugh my then fiance now wife and i drove up there from nc for this game honestly feels like a lifetime ago but this being my partners first game seals this as the best game ive ever been too
its been my desktop background ever since and will probably never change until 7 soooo hopefully february
ill never forget not bothering to watch the game because i thought we were gonna lose and then just mindlessly checking out he score 2 hours later and immediately pulled up the game on my phone and yelled in my car holy fucking shit we fucking did it lmaoo
back in the good old days
i screamed i yelled i was shaky 100 best moment in a game
such a beautiful moment to be a steelers fan
great play kinda lucky gronk didnt absolutely wreck him
is this the same game as in this epic youtube hit featuring renegade
i was at that game and my kids won the signed ball but sadly it was a ab
his vertical is incredible
which was meaningless in the end

bills defense were gonna

steelers what force another pun

bills defense pick six

me oh shit im uncomfortable
just a stale offense with no new ideas and a complete lack of adjusting
interesting breakdown of what the bills did to give pittsburgh problems up frontin coverage
its an interesting break down the first play they show conner just gets thrown to the ground no obstacle to milano forching ben to throw

the second play they show samuels gets pushed into ben again by milano

both were lined up as strong side halfbacks clearly unable to stop milano i guess we were trying to sell those plays as probable run plays but at that point the bills already knew it wasnt going to happen

a lot of people are calling for derek watt to play more offense and while i dont think he will solve all of our problems in those two plays he could have potentially made a difference

i think every team by now is well aware of our weak run game so whats the point in even trying to sell a play as runrpo when in 90 of the cases you know its going to be a short pass before they even line up

we havent won the super bowl since 2008 i dont think ben growing his beard was exactly a good luck charm lol
reverse jinx more at 7
he what
probably his wife got tired of him having a beard after he didnt shave for his arm surgery
has he ever looked in a mirror while beardless
you think we would have learned not to shave beards given the events of super bowl xxx
beard voodoo is why the blog gang that couldnt wants me to spend 60 a year to subscriber to the athletic instead of reading actual journalism for free

sweet sales pitch ta

maybe they should care more about whether or not our o line decides to show up that game or if dj is working on his hands and not trying to run before he has the ball those seem to be more relevant to a win or loss than juju dancing on a logo

its not like he is spitting on it tearing up the turf or something else disrespectful
people only got mad at him for doing this after he lost
but this is the whole reason we lost the game to buffalo s
no one actually believes that opposing players are somehow going to play better just because juju dancing i understand thinking its tacky but its not affecting any in game play
rsteelers dont disrespect the terrible towel

juju dances on other teams logo

rsteelers awwww hes having fun let him have fun
does pittsburgh have the worst media

out of absolutely everything we can ask to get info on this is what is asked fucking stupid
really why is this a thing
if hes doing it on his own logo during home games i dont see how he is doing anything disrespectful

not many places on the field that arent just green
this about sums up how i feel about this whole thing people need to shut the fuck up and let it go this whole thing is fucking stupid
id love to see the day where some opposing player came to heinz field and danced on the steelers logo it would be totally fine on here
good he should do whatever the hell he likes

of course it wont help his imo low chances of getting and long term contract but if they dont like what he does why should he stay anyway we may all feel its stupid but its his life
i dont think he thinks of it as an insult i literally think hes like wheres the coolest place to make this tiktok pregame oh in the middle of the field where its decorated that being said i can also see why people take it as a dis at a glance and he should be more aware do it in the end zone for foreshadowing
the nfl sub is a joke about this rn cant defend juju without massive downvotes meanwhile people actively encouraging injuring him or saying that this is somehow costing us games gets upvoted

if juju were on a feelgood team people wouldnt have started to hate him i dont like his dances but to act like it does anything for the other team is just plain stupid

whenever rnfl comes to a consensus its like the council of the chest pounding retards
do it juju dance on the logo dance in the endzone dance in the locker room then dance to another team whose fans will appreciate you instead of these sour ass yinzers
ok then juju anything for your social media presence dont get upset if an opposing player does something about it
good
juju played a great game id be mad if dj did it
thats some bad juju hes putting on this team my nana said so herself
its kinda a dick move i wish he would stop idc about him doing dances or whatever but theres a reason to got his ass beat its disrespectful
why do people care that much about him having a little extra fun hes giving 110 every snap hes not harming anyone and clearly its not that cringe given how popular he is when did we all become such curmudgeons its like 1000 roger goodell burner accounts in here
good
no i dislike it i am a steelers fan and find that dancing to be dumb if someone danced in the middle of heinz field we would be pissed its also cringey as hell steelers have no identity on offense no time to be dancing playing like that
im glad we only have to see it a few more times then

jesus christ juju can you not give them more fuel to the fire this was cool when we were fucking winning now your just giving them motivation remember what happened in 2016 vs the pats in the afc championship if ab doesent post that facebook live yeah e still lose but bllichek is the very embodiment of petty that added fuel this is idiotic
how about you quit justifying his over cocky and childish behavior

god this sub should get on their knees and allow juju to splurge all over their faces why dont you all just simultaneously go suck his cock
gotta say overall that the jjss experience has been overall negative hes a good player and seems like a nice kid but all we get is dancing and huge fumbles out of juju
i cant be the only one
he should stop it shouldnt have become a thing to begin with he will be gone soon anyways 4 more games of this tic tok clown and its a wrap go dance somewhere else for your money

the trophy was a nice add
accurately portraying how intimidating the bengals are
i love how you repeatedly find a fun way to depict our somewhat obscure mascot
this one i like
you make me happy youre appreciated and everyone says nice things about you
that you for your work
steely boys will take out striped cats
wholesome

lmao antics really seems like an unbiased take
i love his energy his joy his tenaciousness he is a beam of light made human bless you juju
i love it i think its great keep dancing

its basically the equivalent of trash talking as long as were winning and juju is playing well enough to back it up go for it however now that weve lost two games itd probably be best to stay quiet for the time being otherwise its just a bad look im all for players having fun but dance anywhere other than the logo until we start winning games again

i know everyone has different views of the matter obviously
i know i should know better than to argue on rnfl but the folks trying to argue that juju isnt even average just straight up piss me off there is no metric that shows juju as a below average wr in fact i dont think there is a valid argument that keeps him out of the top 20
myself looks like an ass
when people said he was the new hines ward i didnt realize they meant as a dancer
players with stats like his shouldnt flex

imagine musty flicking in a yinzer octane
pog
this is awesome this is one of my nightly games so this is going to be sweet
juju is gonna drop tiktok learn double resets
hell yea
also for people who are unaware about rocket league

it is an incredibly fun and deep car soccer game with cars that can fly as well its esport has multiple million dollar prizepools each year and the game has a few million active players each month

you can get it for free on the epic games launcher
can i get this straight up or do i have to gamble for it
i read that it was coming december 17 on the rocket league page i cant wait ive tried making steelers themed cars in the past
that so cool ive been wondering if there was ever gonna be nfl team skins after they did mlb and nba stuff im excited for that
oops

my bad

yeah sorry i messed up the title good news is though as others have pointed out it it already coming out today and is available only until december 28
ummmm excuse my ignorancebut is rocket league a mobile game that i can play on my ipad i do like racing games but im not buying a console
this is something i will spend money on
downloads epic games launcher
i played this game a lot when it first came out by now i forgot it even existed lol maybe its time i checked it out again i never miss an opportunity to rep the black and gold
dam might be time to pick the game back up again
hell yes
well i swore id never spend money on rl points oh well
nice to see so many rl fans in this sub

we should create a steelers reddit rl club

i wish we had some sets where we went two backs took out ebron and used watt a little more he could always motion to a tight flank position just off the line of scrimmage to fill in as a te at times or lead block but maybe that kind of stuff doesnt work against modern defenses
fichtner supporters in shambles ben is fine with being under center
fingers crossed

i dont know who dave rappocio is but he has a very interesting style

thats awesome
please tell me thats not your house
do u know where they got it thats awesome
draft jarvis jones

free agency ladarius green
artie burns and it isnt even close imo for me i dont worry about the wrs that have busted because we have hit on so many and its not like we have ever been lacking a wr who could produce

up until hadens signing our secondary was soooo weak at the cb position which is why we drafted burns in the first place so when he didnt work out even a little it really hurt us it hurt us in a way i dont think other draft picks hurt us
draft senquez golson

free agency donte moncrief
artie burnssss
lblount for me quitter
green wasnt a free agency bust at all he simply could not recover well enough from horrible concussion issues watch the highlights where he actually got to play for us he was a fuckin beast
draft bust is senquez without a doubt 2nd round pick and never logged a snap jarvis or artie would normally be tough to beat but they at least got on the field

free agency im going with ladarius green i still cant understand why we signed him but either didnt seem to be aware of or didnt think the ankle situation and the concussion issues would bite us in the ass
trade that kicker who shall not be named
jarvis jones in the draft for me you can make arguments for artie burns senquez golson and even dri archer but jones was supposed to be a star jarvis jones just wasnt big enough strong enough or quick enough to dominate at this level in free agency i would go moncrief i expected him to have a huge year for us and he was abysmal you could go green but in that case he at least looked quite good in the rare instances he was on the field
jarvis man i was over the moon about him still think the steelers were wrong to make him bulk up which robbed him of his best asset at worst he wouldve become a vic beasley pass rushing specialist what we basically got was vince williams as a sam

i remember thinking cam thomas would be a useful rotation player useless
draft jarvis jones
free agency blount morgan burnett moncrief lance moore
can we do trades too just so i can say fuck scobee
limas sweed where you at
cam thomas is by far the worst player i have ever seen start multiple times for the steelers ladarius green was just disappointing

i once saw cam thomas get blown off the defensive line so hard that he took both ilbs out of the play
jamaine stevens he transcends categories and decades
draft honestly probably jarvis but artie was more aggravating because in the moment everyone thought it was a terrible desperate pick and played out to be exactly that

free agency antwan now valentino blake signed as a free agent in 2013 and somehow became a starter on defense for two years graded out as the worst corner in the existence of pff in 2015 other guys burned out quickly and didnt produce but id argue blake actively hurt the team in a way the others didnt
artie and jarvis are pretty big busts ladarius is def my biggest fa fuck up

one that gets forgotten is that cb from the eagles brandon boykin who they refused to play think he was hurt then he got cut the next year

hilariously he predicted our struggles last year and everyone clowned him for it brandon boykin believes steelers offense will decline in 2019 because of their backup qb
linus sweed
or so some yinzers in my job tell me discuss
i dont know what happened the last few weeks but im hoping it unhappens
dont care still 112
if you want to win you have to score more points than the other team the steelers should try that more
i struggle with this bc its super hard to win in the nfl and 112 and ending at 133 while locking up the north would be an awesome regular season

im more disappointed that we seem to be playing our worst football rn injuries definitely to blame and that the offense has not gotten fixed or even looked to become more innovative

if we are one and done in the playoffs how do we rate this season idk because seems like this was our best chance to get a ring with the core guys that said we only need to catch fire to win a few games a good place to start would be kicking the shit out of the bengals
i hate blaming it on socalled outside factors like injuries and covid but those certainly ruined our momentum and took a great toll on our mental and physical health as a team so yes this is a legitimate strain

and the offense hasnt been consistently dynamic in those 11 wins some games weve looked better than kc others weve looked mediocre its all catching up to us now

the good news is theres still plenty of time to readjust and get healthy the bengals should be an easy win then theres two weeks to rest ben and the vets and still have the division and a home game come playoffs

its looking a little stressful friends but its far from over
the worst 112 team is that like being the ugliest dude to ever bang a bunch of hot chicks or the dumbest billionaire
omg we had no playoffs for 2 years are people really bitching this has been a fun year to watch lots of late game drama that went right for the good guys
if you had to choose a backup for ben who would it be note if you voted someone else comment who would it be

view poll
aaron rodgers

edit id settle for mahomes
charlie batch
ive been saying fitz would be a dope backup could you imagine those two old bastards just broing out talking about beards and shit thatd be awesome fitz embodies the pittsburgh blue collar mentality too
fitzpatrick would be nice i hear detroit is looking to move on from stafford
fitzpatrick would be perfect
if you believe this team has a chance to compete for a title this season and money is no object then you get a vet who can still win games to be the backup there was a reason charlie batch was well loved he was a guy who could have started for some teams in the league and was able to win games for us when ben was out
id rather have mason the next brady rudolph in there give him a clean pocket and watch him sling it
no one had said josh dobbs
trade for sam darnold now
unpopular opinion but maybe jameis winston
rather bring in someone young that they can develop first and foremost kick the tire on darnold or rosen even someone like minshew fitzpatrick wouldnt be the worst idea failing that
the duck duh
colin kaepernick im sure i spelled his name wrong guys like that sometimes have magic in them remember how good he was and how he could electrify a team imagine him playing now even as a third stringer hed be great to have in a locker room
who would want the dirty laundry he cant even throw against an xfl caliber defense

christmas eve at a dennys is one of the saddest places in america so many lonely broken people trying to get a bite of that diced turkey over mash potatoes gravy appreciate your family and friends this holiday season
shouldnt it say kings
this might be the greatest meme in the history of this sub
if the consensus is that fichtner is bens yes man getting a new oc wont change the fact that ben wants to take every snap out of shotgun nor will it change the fact our ol cant stop a runny nose

im not saying i want fichtner to stay bc i want him gone but hes being unfairly scape goated for most of the offensive stalling
when did we get andy reid
moons over my hammy moons over my hammy on two
in my uneducated opinion i think the line has gradually regressed as a result of losing munchak ben loves the shotgun the 2 minute drill the short quick passesbut he also knows hed be much more successful if he had that running game to open up play action i just dont think the line can run the ball anymore since munchak left
guys guys guys i got it the secret to nfl football is as follows run run pass punt
keep hoping for a turnaround but how many weeks of being terrible on offence is it going to take for the crumbs to lead tomlin and colbert to the kitchen fichtner is too easy to work out and when things go tits up they let ben take over who isnt an oc hes experienced enough to play some things really well but there still had to be a game plan implemented and having a poor plan on offence is costing us results now and letting ben take over is hardly a strategy for replicable success it merely means teams game plan for the plays he likes calling and when you can contain and shut it down its gg


defence is just so wasted on this offence has been for going on 2 years now even with all the injuries it has performed admirably the offence is doing them zero favours and you know it will not take much from the offence to get us back in the win column because the defence continues to be great that they make up the deficit for a substandard offence on their own


no easy answers personnel changes are tough to plan lot of big decisions to be made end of this year draft class will be needing to fill holes mainly on offence for a change potentially a qb line maintenance an absolute must ideally a rb upgrade but we dont draft high on that position but it should be a consideration imo very little cap space


but at worst moving forwards a new oc with fresh ideas and input could really kick start this currently flailing offence its costing us results the defence has masked them all year long started out well but only because teams werent quite sure of our lineup now theyre familiar with ben again and they know the likes of claypool and juju are threats we need better scheming to throw them off the scent and keep this offence pounding and soaring fichtner doesnt have a creative bone in his body and ben taking the helm later in games is being worked out by oppositions
made what i just see randy fichtner there
many many years ago the dd ran a red light left turn off of 19 mcknight road

cop who we passed threw on his lights into the parking lot

were parked im in the back seat shitting myself cop shines his light around all of us and asks whats the hurry my friend says they have really good fries so for 3 hours we ate fries while talking with cops
literally lold
why does he cover his mouth when he has a mask on
omg this is great
laughing in quahog

big ben n peter show id watch that
dennys has the best milkshakes
holy crap tomlin
yall act like ben isnt a fucking mummy being protected by the whole offensive scheme you think things are bad now remember last year

ben can only play the way we are playing now i am not saying whether or not he should retire but youre gonna see this offense until he does
this looks familiar
and the beard doesnt cover the chinballs
i have such mixed feelings about ben i love him as a qb and our leader but i also get the feeling that hes a bit of a terrorist inside that organization it seems like he gets his way no matter what and youd better not even think of disagreeing with him unless you outrank him
this is the oldest image this thing was circling when kitchens was the browns coach

anyone else want to post this

thats all it is week in and week out just hype talk but no action to follow through with past 6 weeks they have been talking about changing their strategy and havent then the past 3 weeks theyve been more specifically focused on making changes with the run game and mixing up the passing game nothing there either i cant even listen to these dudes no more they just gonna have to prove it and beating the bengals isnt proving it thats something we ought to do anyway the colts and browns is where they get a chance to show us some change
is conner playing we need his running game back
they say this kind of stuff every week and ben has become a master at politician speak

go out and prove it


view poll
i think we should play ben this and next week and sit him and the starters week 17 regardless seeding isnt that important anymore and we arent getting number 1 but we want to make sure we arent number 4 so we dont have to play kc until the championship
if we can play for the number one seed we should go all out

if were forced to play to lock up a home game we should go all out

any other scenario we should be resting our guys
if they lock up the division i would have him practice like normal but have him be the back up against the colts have him ready to play if necessary and then rest him in full for the final week of the season i fully believe the 1 seed is out of the picture at this point so might as well give some guys some rest if the division is locked up
i would say yes but with all the drops and issues on offense i think they need the playing time not so much ben but the receivers maybe sit him at half treat them like preseason i honestly dont really know
ben gets to rest plenty every wednesday in fact
only if we have our seed confirmed andor are blowing the fuck out of whoever were playing
oh please god no im a ravens fan that has never rooted for the steelers and now that we need you to win you just gonna sit all your starters fine we will make the playoffs ourselves
i think if anything we play ben for just the first half of the browns game
yeah just what we need an even more rusty roethlisberger in the wild card game
depends on what the chefs doyes i called them chefs

i think the state farm commercial with mahomes telling jake that he can wear the ring for an houror whatever just turned me off

i am a political kind of guy and am so sick of people blowing their own horns about how great they are as has been commonplace for the last four yearsevery fucking daythat a commercial that i might have blown off as amusing has now left a bitter taste in my mouth just irritates me

i just want to see people like that fail miserably and truthfully i even sort of felt that way about ben in his drink like a champion days i mean i love the steelersbut i despise assholesand back then he was an asshole

i do believe in second chances and redemption and that asshole back then that i had a bit of trouble being happy for has really turned his life around became a humble person who truly understands how fortunate he has been and is now living an honorable life and that makes it much easier for me to root for him

and mahomes just reminds me of old benan overconfident douchebag who thinks he owns the world

truth is his window is already closing

edit sorry for the rantit was just an observation
my fantasy team votes no
assuming kansas city doesnt lose anymore i think we should only consider a week 17 rest for ben because i think there is too much going on with the offense right now to sit ben more then that that way we still let him rest up for playoffs but we also allow for the offense to conduct further tests

put randy fichtner here instead and also the offensive lines run blocking and dionte johnson and eric ebrons excuses for hands and bens deep ball if we dont beat the bengals by 40 its a failure
awesome

no trashing the ravens right now guys out of respect
amen

ben is 163 yards away from 60k passing yards and 4 completions away from 5k career receptions a sure 1st ballot hofer should be fun to watch the celebration

my prediction 1st three passes of the game go for 160 yards and the 4th reception takes him to a cool 164 passing yards and 4tds on the day

and thats the end of the 1st quarter
but then the game starts and randy starts off with a run run screen
we cant catch 1 pass what makes you think we can catch four
hes also only 8 tds away from 400
e
ok i like a good story but for some math

1603533 repeating

you are saying that each of his first three passes will on average go for over half of the field i meanif the passes are for 5 yards and the receivers can get that in yac then maaaaybe but probably not

ben in real life isnt throwing streaks against gold or silver dbs in madden

in madden solos he is

does it happen against the bungles yeah just not like this
right now the steelers look as though they could lose in the first round but can any of you honestly tell me there were no moments during the 2008 or 2004 seasons where it looked as though the team could lose early in the playoffs

i shouldnt have to remind you about the adversity the steelers overcame in 20042005 but even in 2008 the steelers had a loss at home to the colts they lost week 16 to the titans as they fought for a first round bye

are there things to criticize about this team sure that can be said about every team even the best especially when the best teams lose but get this low energy shit out of here the steelers thrive on adversity and if you dont think tomlin and ben will have this team ready to go by playoff time you have let recency bias cloud your vision of who this team is

this is the fucking 6x champion pittsburgh steelers led by coach of the year mike tomlin future hall of fame qb big ben and extremely competitive play makers on both sides of the ball this is the team that god himself chose to intervene on behalf of with the immaculate reception we will get healthier by playoff time and be prepared to be competitive with any team we face here we go
with the interviews coming out im getting a cruise control vibe right now limit the injuries fix things you dont like etc they arent fighting for a playoff spot and without fans i dont think they actually give a shit about the bye in the playoffs right now its just about going through the motions and getting everyone back healthy for playoffs whats that shit they do in the nba load management i think thats what they are doing
i dont know why people keep feeling the need to make posts like this while acting like the offense being shitty is some new occurrence or a oneoff thing the issues have existed the entire season and are now routinely fucking the team over while they show absolutely zero signs of changing anything there is no reason at all to be optimistic right now yeah maybe theyll miraculously turn out a completely new offense probably not its completely justified to worry

but can any of you honestly tell me there were no moments during the 2008 or 2004 seasons where it looked as though the team could lose early in the playoffs

difference this season is that we have looked like that in most of our games solely because the offense has been so unreliable it was an issue while winning and now its taking its toll
youre comparing apples to oranges 20042008 things were new ben was still new much like things in kc with mahomes and buffalo with josh allen right now an elite historic d was just coming together

its 2020 it feels like theres nothing new with this team all of the warts that have plagued late season declines and one and done playoff exits for the past decade this team doesnt thrive on adversity they havent overcome it to accomplish anything in also a decade
my biggest concern isnt that theyre having bad games its that the bad games are stacking up one after another the last 3 weeks have felt like a completely different offense than earlier in the year its like weve been exposed and now were standing with our pants around our ankles and no backup plan
i like to think there maybe a bit of a ropeadope happening lulling the other teams asleep and maybe holding a few key plays in the back pocket
this aint 2004 or 2008 though and i can only go off of what i see and hear from the 2020 steelers and it is not pretty this team has been folding not thriving under adversity the last few weeks future hall of fame quarterback ben roethlisberger is not the big ben of 1015 years ago this team is going to have to win by sheer luck plays like the ir unless something changes drastically in the next week and a half that is the honest assessment of where this team is at right now not your rah rah feel good nonsense
weve got the bengals this week should help us rebuild confidence and shake this ugly miasma weve been stuck in

huh
unpopular opinion we need to start going 5 wide more and need to start giving juju deeper routes

wish they could score 40 now
omfg thank you for posting this been looking for this as its one of the top three memes in existence
should have lowered the head a little so it looks like hes gobbling up the fans i dont know why
one of pittsburgh dads best jokes ever was when he asked if the cardboard fans still leave on that escalator

ive stated many times since that those first few seconds after he caught it and was ruled a td are going to be the peak of the second half of bens career
from new england fuck the pats the fact that they lost the sb on a questionable catch later that year was complete karmic justice
back when our offense could catch
the nfl officiating twitter account releasing a video of al riveron explaining this play was probably the dumbest thing of all time at one point al literally says ben completes a pass to james
i will never not be upset about this seeing the pats on the brink of missing the playoffs brings me so much joy
i hardly slept that night
i cry every time
never should have let him go
i wonder if im the only steelers fan not bitter about this i always thought the no catch call was correct no matter how much it sucked

not sure ill ever get over this
it was a great catch
if we won that game i truly believe things would have turned out differently with ab and bell butterfly effect
they should have won
i was at that game the crowd was so confused
i was at the game as well and a student at psu at the time jesse caught it the following february i was a volunteer at thon working in event security he was very involved in thon during his time at penn state and he came back that year and made an appearance on stage afterwards he was leaving with his girlfriend and he stopped right next to me to tie his shoe i kept quiet to remain professional while on duty but you have no idea how badly i wanted to tell him that i was there and saw him catch that ball
i was there too and i knew that they were going to overturn that call just to be clear it was 100 a catch but i knew in my bones that there was no chance the nfl was going to let us win that game on that call it was devastating my dad and i didnt talk the entire drive home once
im fromlive in new england of all the times these pieces of shit fucked us over the last 20 years this one hurt the absolute most very happy theyre suffering now even if bradys gone and i liked cam before he got there
yea sadly its my birthday and i was pissed
the catch
the ramifications of that call changed the landscape of so much we win 7 and ab lev probly would have stayed get enough momentum to go on another run the following year oh yea i was at this game too i ended my wedding vows with jesse james caught that ball smh lets not do this today
that was just the topping on the shit sandwich of a year that was 2017 for me and it was my birthday

jesse caught that ball
i was there too
guess ill once again be the lone steelers fan to point out that according to the rules and how they were consistently called at the time it was not a catch

if a player goes to the ground in the act of catching a pass with or without contact by an opponent he must maintain control of the ball until after his initial contact with the ground whether in the field of play or the end zone
detroit lions legend jesse james
i dont have an encyclopedic memory but i knew just what play you were referring to

my parents were patriots fans at the time and we were talking shit to eachother via phone that whole game it sure seemed like a crock of shit while it was happening
i was there with patriots fans from work and the heartbreak that happened was unbelievable from juju breaking that 70 some odd yard catch losing my mind and then scoring that touchdown only to have to stripped away and still get ragged on for it 3 years later
brother i was at college at umass streaming this game so there was a delay and my mom texted me good job steelers we win before the catch got overturned i guess on her screen and they were still lining up for that play on my screen and i got so fuckin mad that what we all thought was a touchdown got spoiled for me imagine the look on my face when it certainly wasnt good job steelers we win
i came from france to see that game that call ruined an otherwise perfect trip
i still remember screaming my head off in my apartment so pissed watching the refs rob us at the end of that game
why did it have to be on my birthday this day lives forever in infamy
feelsbadman
that was my first game at heinz man the emotions the last few minutes of the game were crazy
should have kept him
never forgive never forget that was the worst ref call i ever saw glad the rule got changed
unfortunately ben choked the game away on the next play
didnt survive the ground my butt
100 a catch
just a prime example that the refs are never on pittsburghs side and that they love raw dogging the fuck out of us

if pittsburgh wins monday against cincinnati is the division clinched or do we have to beat the coltsbrowns too
clinched
or if the browns lose to the giants doubtful
wed clinch and it would be huge because we could then even think about resting people to get healthy for the playoffs unless the chiefs lose in which case we could still be playing for the 1 seed

might as well give ray rice an award for trying to stop domestic violence

the helmet incident is one thing yes its really bad but tempers flare so i guess we can cut him some slack but blatantly lying about rudolph calling him the nword to try to get him cancelled is way worse imo people arent talking about this enough

just to remind us all ray lewis murdered someone
the sub wouldnt be the same without fresh yinzer opinions voice your unpopular thoughts hot takes and bold predictions here about anything football related

hate an admired playercoach love a hated playercoach do you actually like roger goodell think jesse didnt catch it he did any opinion about the steelers the rest of the league or the game in general are accepted throw em all here

responding to someones comment to create civil discussion and changing opinions are encouraged dont be a damn jagoff and turn it into a toxic argument

do not downvote others because you dont like their opinion

downvotereport content that break the rules

this thread is intended to not shame others who have different ideas and thoughts that go against the grain of the metas in the sub



and as always dont be a damn jagoff
this team cannot win a championship with the offense they have been running for the last month or so if the condensation of the offense is a result of nagging roethlisberger injuries and there seems to some thought that it is then sit him the next two weeks and get him healthy for the playoff run they can probably beat the bengals with mason and at that point there really is not much of a difference between the 2 seed and 4 seed in this years playoffs
prediction the benching worked and dionte is about to play the game of his life
mike hilton doesnt get the respect he deserves one of the most important players on the team that you dont see much of
according to this sub all hope is lost so my hot take is we will figure out how to fix our problems and head into the playoffs confident all starts with a get right game against cincy
and if we cant figure out our issues were headed for a first round exit that we 100 deserve
were gonna come out with the same gameplan as the last 3 weeks and win because its the bengals its gonna give coaching the confidence to keep it rolling like that naturally well get slaughtered by the colts sit starters week 17 come out wildcard weekend still having the same bullshit gameplan and shit the bed
ben hates it but we need to run some playaction if we are going to be successful at intermediate passes and gun game tomlin is a great coach but he needs to put his foot down on this
bold prediction we win our wildcard game and lose in the divisional round one week later we will find out that ben was playing on a partially torn meniscus from the dallas game onward
the short passing game contributes to drops because receivers need to quickly turn up field after the catch

its a bad habit by the receivers but understandable given the frequency of short passes

even good receivers would struggle only great or halloffamer receivers would not struggle
i think we win but it definitely wont be a blowout the bengals may actually lead at some point and itll come down to the last minutes of the 4th quarter as is the tradition

this is the way
tomlin and fichtner forgot they have a fullback on the roster
heres my hot take randy sphincter calls the same 5 plays all game and we lose by 3
after week 12 there hasnt been a true offensive gameplan ben has been experimenting with plays to see what works and what doesnt
hot take we start to gain momentum against cincy really get the ball rolling against indy rest some against cleveland week 17 and then come into the playoffs like a god damn freight train
darnold or haskins would be a waste of time darnold for as bad of a situation he is in has shown very little and haskins was benched for poor work ethic would things be better here maybe but i doubt either of these guys are good enough to replace ben
shaun sarrett needs to be replaced asap

patrick mahomes is not human
going into the season i expected to go about 106 and get bounced in the first round of the playoffs

at least now we will go 124 or 133 and get bounced in the first round of the playoffs lol

i am happy with the outcome of this season i have always had realistic expectations about how the season would go we had an unbelievable run and i havent had this much fun watching steeler football in a long time i think if we stayed healthy we could have had a realistic shot at the super bowl but a lot of teams in the nfl season can say that

some positive notes from this season

we have a great defense and we should be just as good next year if not better i know we will probably lose bud and a nickel corner but a healthy devin bush will make up for any losses
edmunds took a huge step forward and now is an average safety which is great joe haden is getting older but still a top 15 cb in the league steve nelson took a step back but both sutton and hilton looked unbelievable when healthy our secondary will still be at the top of the league
our dline looks great and has stayed mostly healthy for a season we should be just as good next year
as mentioned a healthy devin bush could have helped us make a super bowl push back ups have filled in better than expected but not amazing highsmith has looked like he can be a starter going forward which is good news if we lose bud
i will actually take the defense on our wrs they have had no time to take reps from ben in practice and it shows we have a great group of wrs when ben gets back into practice and they get time catching balls from their qb and not a backup with a completely different throwing motion we will be alright again we have the deepest wr core in the nfl and it looks like would be fine even if we dont sign juju next year
qb play ben has been ben i dont love that fact that when he hits the ground he has to check to see if his bones are in place and still work lol but overall he has looked very good this year

some negative notes from this season

our offensive line took the biggest step down i have ever seen in a matter of 2 years we went from the best oline in the league to arguably bottom 10 even with injuries there is no excuse with pouncey and decastro to be so bad
our running backs i dont need to say much on the matter connor hasnt had anywhere to run but i still dont think he is a startingcaliber rb dont get me wrong i love the guy and hopes he is a steeler until he retires but he cannot stay healthy and even when he gets in the game he hasnt looked great his running style does not work with the play of our oline
clearly we need to groom the next qb ben looks good but he is very fragile

overall i am happy with the season and we have shown enough that i will get my hopes up again next year i think we need to target some olinemen in free agency and make drafting a qb and rb a priority
ben is too old and one of the biggest reasons why the offense is so one dimensional
im genuinely looking forward to him retiring
honestly had more fun watching the 2019 steelers than i did this year
unpopular opinion i cant wait for the jesse james caught that shit to die its been 3 fucking years
unpopular opinion the decline of big ben has already started and its only going to get worse
we are going to draft another day two wr
last week i predicted a 3117 loss to the bills and going 124 i still stand by the 124 i think the steelers will exit the playoffs in the first round i think injuries are a legit excuse this year ben has one more productive year in him theres my hot takes
we arent showing the full playbook now that we are on cruise control to the playoffs homefield doesnt matter as much and the bye presents risks with covid
after a sweep of the ravens its all gravy
my hot take the ol gives ben more than 21 seconds to let a play develop and johnson redeems himself

juju grinds on the 50 yard line for his tiktok dance
our future looks like the current patriots post ben at least until we get a serviceable qb mason aint it period and were not a tank for player x type organization
i think stafford should come to the steelers seems like a good bentype passer
since the supposed unpopular take repeated 20 times in here is that we lose every game the rest of the season except maybe the bengals my actual unpopular opinion is we are a good football team that will get better as people return from injuries and we win the remainder of our games and i like our chances against everyone but the bills and chiefs in the playoffs
sutton has cb1 potential
while claypool is a good receiver drafting dobbins or even hurts would have been so much more beneficial to this team in my opinion they were both available when we drafted him dobbins would have made the run game something while our receivers still would have been great with washington juju and johnson dobbins is also a good receiver hurts has proven that he definitely wouldve had a chance to be a good quarterback to follow up ben love chase but we are feeling the effects of not having a running game and are getting to that point where we really need a competent future quarterback

plus i have heard people say chase wouldve been available in the 3rd round
1 and done in the playoffs if we dont pull it together
i want the steelers to trade for trevor lawrence when he refuses to play for the jets
if bell had stayed we would be undefeated and on the way to a super bowl

worried without the run game doing well
its been a few weeks now and it seems like everyone has already forgotten about the ravens covid outbreak i cant help but think that the delays in our schedule had a major impact on the last 2 games with that being said when will the nfl announce their punishment what will the punishment be will the nfl even do anything the nfl was pretty quick to penalize the broncos for their small scale outbreak why has it taken them so long in the ravens case
goodell is going to wave his finger very hard at them over zoom then hell tell them that lamar is not permitted to be on the cover of madden ever again
their punishment was moving a few games around so lamar conveniently only had to miss one game instead of two
they already announced it

heres a link
there will not be one the league bent over backwards for the ravens when they had the outbreak and now it is time for everyone to just forget about it and pretend it never happened
ideally it would be their 1st round pick and we would get that pick

same for the titans
oh the nfl will get their money in the form of a fine that will definitely happen eventually

as far as the steelers being impacted in recent weeks because of it it absolutely had a negative effect on the team deviations in a schedule can have lasting impacts and i fully believe that it contributed to our losses however most of our wins this year have been sloppy a combination of an aging qb im a fan of ben so it does pain me to say this who very well may have some lingering physical injuries that limit mobility an offensive coordinator who consistently calls repetitious plays and completely fails to make proper adjustments through a game a head coach also a tomlin fan and i know this might be unpopular but who is recognizing needed improvements but failing to take corrective action refer to the first pass of the was game to butterfingers after multiple weeks of performing poorly the injuries this season and an offensive line whoi dont even need to point out the obvious on that one all of that has contributed more to our losses than the ravens ability to follow covid protocols

but trust methe nfl will get their money dont worry
anybody thinking the ravens arent about to get slapped pretty hard are being homers their outbreak has been the worst so far and can be tied directly to reckless behavior i think it is taking longer because they probably want to make sure the outbreak is completely contained and all the facts are clear

now will that make the steelers feel any better about what it has done to their season hell no in fact at the minimum they should get some sort of late round draft pick compensation for enduring schedule breaking outbreaks from two separate teams but we know that wont happen so there is justification in feeling frustrated by that but dont think the ravens will get a pass here
i think you underestimate the amount of time it takes to really fully investigate something like this especially when it affected so many folks within the organization saunders is the easy scapegoat but the league has to determine it really was him if it was just him they have to schedule time to interview a ton of people while they still prepare for games its likely not gonna conclude until after the season is over i suspect their punishment will be similar to the titans a decent sized fine and maybe a late round pick i know were all angry and we want them to take higher picks but i just dont see the league being that extreme with any team unless they blatantly launched a concerted antiprotocol effort
theyll have to spend the rest of their existence as a franchise in a dilapidated third world shithole until or unless their owner makes another midnight run for greener pastures leaving them to stew in their own turd broth
was just wondering this myself it did take the nfl quite some time to levy other covid related punishments ravens will most likely get a fine and lose a day 3 draft pick
14million and 3rd round draft pick
its ironic too bc they had so many test positive they really dont have to worry about key players missing any playoff games if they make it since theyre all immune
you didnt hear lamar got the bubble guts in the middle of a divisional game that was their punishment

why do we give a fuck about the ratbirds at this point
we got the shaft from the nfl but the rooneys dont care truth be told we wont get far with mike as the head coach

i never thought id say this but im proud of randy
good to start practicing it in week 15
good cant always rely on the refs to call defensive pass interference also if theyre going to blanket receivers to take away the short game we need to make them pay for that coverage with some deep balls
hes learning
talk is cheap show me on monday
wow thats like a fix that shouldve happened after the houston game and they missed like 4 wide open ones
honestly if they can incorporate the deep ball successfully and turn our offense back into an offense instead of a disgrace id be more than delighted to stop saying fire randy
well great nice to say that
how about we start practicing intermediate passing
deep passes require pass protection to be maintained until receivers get down field and open how does this help our offense when the line is bad and the run game is weak wrs can barely get open in the midrange pass patterns and then youll still have them need to actually catch a football which theyve forgotten how to do on a regular basis just not sure what is the real benefit the deep pass helps when its actually a threat to connect not sure bens elbow is an issue or not but the drops certainly are and prevent the deep pass from having decent success probability
i hate that this is even a headline

but to be honest i dont even think its necessarily the deep ball thats the biggest passing game problem its that we have absolutely zero intermediate passing game every single throw is either five yards and under or a 40 yard overthrown deep throw we need to work the middle of the field

and dont get me started on the lack of play action or the over reliance on shotgun
update roethlisberger did not practice today

so much for that then i guess
but only today
same man said wed be seeing a lot more of derek watt ill believe it when i see it
doesnt matter if our oline cant pass block for more that 25 secs nobody is getting open 40 yards down the field in that short of time

then assuming someone gets open and ben has 3 seconds to throw the ball the receivers still have to catch which i dont have a whole lotta confidence in
this is posturing so cin plans for deep routes and then we get em w the ole 12 bubble screen drop punch
i really wanted to post we i did it but people dont pick up sarcasm in text form and i really didnt want to spend my day reading hate mail
this is a good idea i also suggest that randy takes some time out of practice to have the qbs get under center nothing crazy just have them cycle in and out so he sees that its possible
problem solved lol i sure those extra 1015 rep going deep will fix everything
everything stems from not knowing how to draw up run plays plain and simple everything will follow once you get that fundamental piece settled
lol
doesnt matter if the line cant block for 3 seconds for players to get down field
randys gut is full of dirty old cheeseburgers
randy translation

throwing the ball deep 12 yards past the line of scrimmage
prepare for nothing but deep passes all game on monday the bungles will never see it coming
this is pretty funny considering ben took a veteran day off today
also ben didnt practice today xd
what about the run scheming and the overall catching of balls
incoming 44 attempts over 20 yards next game

first possession of the game whats randy got planned

hail mary

its the first posses

four verts
maybe they should practice catching them though
run the fucking ball randy
oline is playing terrible we have no run game wrs have the dropsies and ben lost some zip on his long ball im not holding my breath on our offense improving and the game vs bengals wont change my mind if we can produce vs colts then ill reconsider
coach randy the what
doesnt mean shit if you dont ever call it lol
need to spend more time getting people to actually catch the ball also when deep balls have been thrown ben is often under or over the mark
how about catching the long ball
i read the first half of the headline and got way too excited thinking they fired him xd
do you think we should target a free agenttrade
do you think we should try to draft a guy in the draft
do you think we should try to keep grooming mason rudolph and push off this problem until ben finally retires

honestly i think we should try to trade for carson wentz i know this wont sit well with a lot of fans but i think he is incredibly talented and could be a great fit in our scheme
i think we should wait until ben retires so we dont have another terry bradshaw situation where he wont even participate in team functions bc he was drummed out of town at the end of his career

if you universal usage somehow imagine the qb situation will be some sort of seamless transition then you are going to be disappointed its happened exactly once in the entire history of the nfl with favre rodgers montana young doesnt count when you realize young had been in the league a decade before he ever started for the 9ers

just let ben play until he calls it quits the infinitesimal chance of finding your next franchise guy while ben is still playing not only doesnt help your current team it could easily alienate the guy who has been the foundation of your success for 20 years

its a feckless idea the steelers know it and they wont make the bradshaw mistake again i promise you
rudolph gets a crack and when we go 79 or 610 in a season well use that 1020 pick on a qb
our future qb is probably a sophomore in college right now
realistically they ride with ben until he retires after next season maybe sign a stopgap or keep rudolph for a season and then draft their future qb
has anyone mentioned sam darnold yet s
you could have just read through the other few dozen of these threads to find out we only see about one of these qb threads a day
im an eagleswentz fan and i am so sad that the whole nfl fandom has totally given up on him yes this season has been horrendous from him but he is a talented player and one bad stretch shouldnt define him i hope hes traded somewhere for a fresh start and i think the steelers would be good
as it stands right now to get wentz via trade were looking at being on the hook for about 25m per year when would you propose getting wentz they arent going to be paying 25m for a bench player
if we want to draft a guy we are probably better going burnt earth trade everything of value trade watt for 2 1st round picks have a winless season or two until we can get the qb we want to bank our figure on

i think we have a lot of talent so i favor grabbing a league average qb in free agency and seeing what we can do
i really want to get trey lance dude has so much potential and he will be able to sit a year or 2 behind ben
the two best and most feasible options are sam darnold and gardner minshew lets face it those guys are getting replaced by the top two draft picks darnold has had a much crappier career yet i think has a higher ceiling considering that minshew has really not done anything to lose his job i feel like the asking price for him will be quite a bit higher than darnold either way trade for one of those guys probably cut rudolph after preseason and utilize the draft to build a good roster around whichever guy we traded for ben will play next year but i think itll be his last so the guy we bring in will have time to be coached into the system and especially for darnold will have a chance to fully reset other than the ol which i believe should be the key focus in the draft this team is built for a young quarterback to succeed
josh rosen

hed be super cheap has a big chip on his shoulder and a ton of talent would do pittsburgh proud
if roethlisberger retires after this year doubtful imo then you invest heavily in offensive line in this years draft let rudolph got 511610 next year after the team has hemorrhaged talent in free agency and then you go use a top 12 pick to go get your guy in the 2021 draft maybe even move up if need be and drop him into a pretty decent system on the off chance that rudolph actually shows improvement then maybe you ride with him another year and see if its for real

the more likely scenario is that roethlisberger signs an extension this offseason and tacks on another couple of years and this gets kicked down the road to 20222023 in which case the qb of the future is probably only being talked about on scoutcom
i think the steelers could use a complete overhaul of their offense and it starts with their qb with this in mind i think they should target a guy such as jameis winston if hes available or perhaps wait a year and then see if a young mobile qb in the 2022 draft is available for them in
the only upside of ben retiring after this season is that randy will most likely not be extendedthats probably not happening though

outside of that it will just depend on how good this team is next yearif they are terrible and drafting in the top 10 obviously look at drafting a qb if they make the playoffs and are drafting in the 20smaybe free agent or give mason a 1 year prove it deal ideally they are drafting 32nd the next two years and we figure out the qb later
honestly wouldnt mind seeing what happens with darnold and wentz right now neither of them look like possibilities but you never know what will happen between now and next offseason or more realistically between now and the offseason after that i dont think ben would retire after this year so if the jets or eagles wanna move on from their guys this offseason i dont think were in position to make a move on em
agree with wentz but hell prob cost us a lot i also like sam darnold how would prob be much cheaper but both are quality players that would thrive in our offense the other option would be to draft someone 1st round like trask from florida but i think we need help in other areas like our oline

looks great marry her

can he catch
my family has one of these we call him stevie steeler

we lost the first game after we got him and hes been locked in the ottoman since 2015
my mom got me one for christmas one year and i lost it soon after human pillow pets are creepy its like theyre in the middle of some weird man beast devolution
hey guys
kill it with fire
my 8month old son loves wrestling and taking naps with ourspretty sure he thinks its a cat since both of our cars are black and he loves trying to chase them got it as a gag gift a few years ago and loved tormenting my wife with it its truly a masterpeice
my husband got me one for christmas a few years ago i keep it on my couch and squeeze it when i get stressed during games its like a really big stress ball
i have one of these somewhere
i always wondered why my purdue one didnt have purdue pete on it now im glad it doesnt
i just ran across mine a couple of weeks ago
i have one of these but its the bear one

stop i have ptsd
i remember it like it was yesterday i was at work at the time i was a waiter the game was at the end of the 4th quarter and i was constantly hiding back in the kitchen to check the score on my phone my boss was getting frustrated with me for being on my phone but i didnt care one bit pittsburgh was in the red zone i was pretending to fill the juice machine so i could watch the scoreboard live thats when jesse james caught that ball i saw the steelers take the lead and for all intents and purposes seal their victory and the 1 seed in the afc i jumped and shouted when i saw it i was so excited my coworkers who also hated the pats were happy for me and i thought that was it i turned off my phone and went back to work happy as could be by this time it was probably 630645 and we were closing so i left the kitchen for not even 5 minutes to go help clean the dining room when i came back in the kitchen a couple minutes later it was dead quiet inside usually filled with the chatter of the staff all the guys were huddled around one of their phones back by the dishwasher and immediately i knew something was up i figured brady pulled some bs out of his ass like usual and actually managed to regain the lead legitimately but no it was so much worse i remember checking my phone to see that the score was final pats win i was speechless and confused as we all walked down the stairs to the basement to clock out for the night it would have been just after 7 by then i already knew there was a controversial call but i hadnt seen it myself until one of my coworkers showed me the play i was frozen in place my jaw on the floor i felt nauseous disappointed and enraged all at the same time since even by then the referees screwing the steelers had become all too common
i hate this game but 2017 steelers were such a fun team
its crazy how that one play completely changed the rest of that season
ive never seen my dad as happy as he was when jesse james caught that touchdownand the refs took that away from him
did you know 3 years ago jesse james caught that fucking ball
man i thought i had it rough i had front row to that pi call on haden in new orleans it was the biggest eye roll of my life
im blaming it on you op
i was there too drove out from des moines still stings
i wish the rules were how they are now back then
jesse james caught that football

odds are 52 those will be my last words
ill be bitter about this until the day i die
that was my first home steelers game it was wild as a whole i sat in the nosebleeds and every time i saw gronk or edelman open that brady dude went straight to them there were also some pats fans from canada sitting behind my group so that was a fun back and forth

but the most memorable part of that game outside of the play that forced an nfl rule change was seeing shazier on the big screen
i flew up from florida to be able to tell my children that i saw jessie james catch that football with my own eyes
i dont understand this meme if he caught the ball it woulnt still be recorded as an incompletion they correct stats when they fuck up and they didnt correct this
yall are going to downvote me into oblivion he didnt catch the ball he didnt make a football move and the ground jarred the ball loose it wasnt a catch and fumble it was an incompletion


fichtner were working on deep passes today

big ben dnp
so when fitchner said they are working on deep passes this week he meant with rudolph lol
ben has been practicing two days a week for years chill out
lmao of course conner is injured
i wonder how many other qbs in the league miss as much practice as ben i get its because hes old and beat up but its clearly having an effect on the teams performance

although he practiced last week and still looked bad against buffalo so who knows at this point
ben i need to be better also ben takes a day off
weird the steelers site says haden dnp

anyone else forget sean davis was back on the roster until they saw this
wheres spilliane
ben needs to practice with the receivers more its clear they dont have any synergy whatsoever
i will enlighten all of you based on my years and years of playing professional quarterback and many more years coaching them of the logic behind the teams policy relating to bens practice time and vet days off oh yeah i have absolutely no such experience i just like beer and chicken wings nevermind
is chuks back too
jesus conner
bens always hurt lol

better at blocking probably
looks about as formidable as our current ol
its funny because its true
can you build a receiver that can catch
removed
yeah get over it every single year teams have their bye week  and have a 3game stretch that gets changed up and yanked around multiple times leading up to the games for issues that are 100 attributed to their opponent thats nothing new
we do not care
gtfoh
yes but also leads to mini bye after which was also stripped from us soo not surprising to see us sputtering a little bit right now
the issue was we werent suppose to lol and thats 4 games in 19 days who else has played that many games in a row in that short amount of time
the overwhelming majority of the time they have to play a team that also has had to play 3 games in 12 days washington got more than a week between their thanksgiving game and their game against the steelers its absolutely not an excuse but its a factor
personally i just dont like that because of 2 teams violating protocol we have had our teams momentum thrown off that wednesday game threw the team off and its kinda obvious it sucks but thats why its hard to have an undefeated season i got trust in the team because tomlin and ben are usually lights out in december
yeah but those thursday games are also against teams with a short week the steelers had 3 games in 12 days where one kept getting rescheduled and fucked up their preparation then they had a super short week against a team with 11 days to prepare and then a sunday nighter on the road
you dont even get it and you still took the time and effort to come here just to be a jag

my wife got me those same ones on my birthday theyre pretty dope
yinz ken flip yer kilbossy wit doze
just in time to flip some roasted bengal on the grill
nice
fyi they make a grill spatula as well i have it looks almost identical to one side of the tongs with the top of the handle incorporating a bottle opener as well
if youre cooking what youre making properly you shouldnt need that blade edge a 1 pair of tongs should suffice things shouldnt stick to your heat source
i will miss him but im very interested in life after big ben and the oline that has been virtually created for him where do you think our offensive scheme will go or if it will even change up after much of this line leaves as well as a probable replacement for connor i like connor but i just dont believe he has much more longevity in the nfl
if canada becomes oc i imagine we do an offensive overhaul and grab whatever players fit his system
ben remains for another year we build the rbs and oline through this draft and next one

draft replacement ben and treat him like we treated baby ben give him a great run game and a suffocating defense
i actually hope we go back to a strong run i love watching a running duo tear it up
till we lose badly or tank we are not the type to get a low draft qb or a free agent qb to come in and straighten up the team our history in drafts and thereby talent assessment is poor with qbs cbs and safetys

we are extremely good at assessing other positions in draft for secondary we can always retool from trades or fa no good qbs ever come available in free agency only the hasbeens

so we are better off relying either on a very high draft pick whereby talent is undeniable like ben or currently trevor etc or wait till we get to a high draft pick through a major trade or tanking
unfortunately for conner it looks like hes on the fragile side

unless he takes a ridiculously team friendly deal he will not be resigned
i love ben just as much as the next person but im ready for some mason rudolph going deep to chase for the win mason can be the next brady with the right training let him work on footwork and pocket awareness and build an actual offense around him people dont realize this offense runs specifically for ben mason isnt a backyard run around and throw it type of qb or a 2 second in pocket slant qb give him an o line and an offensive scheme that fits his play style and watch him work
theres going to be a mass exodus with ben av pouncey fichtner and colbert for sure and i wouldnt be surprised if tomlin leaves too gonna be an interesting couple of transition years for sure
x200b

also happening today
hopefully they are also practicing catching the deep ball that helps too
he had his practice jersey and gloves on during his wednesday press conference so i assume he practiced in some capacity
i meant with duck hodges randy fichtner probably
no comment
i believe theyve been worried about bens elbow hence the short passing game that trick isnt working anymore though i mean hes still fucking throwing it 50 times a game here and there let it rip and if interceptions are a worry well id rather it be picked off 5060 yards down field that 2 years away from the line of scrimmage

thats why ben has had so many battedtipped balls also no arc on the ball in the short passing game threading the ball over the line to get it to a guy on a crossing route 20 times a game youre gonna have some tipped passes
fichtners playbook probably fits on a beer coaster anyways but damn randy dont give away your secrets that easily
why do we refuse to move on from randy
wednesday was an extra day since they play monday night so ben is on the same schedule he has been all season
is there a betting site with how many pass attempts ben will throw beyond 20 yards id like to put money on the under
randy fitchner were going to practice throwing me meatballs today


theyre fixed it for you
its like custer in night at the museum

when i say we are not going to attack we attack
so good for claypool right
i sure hope so we throw way too many short passes
yeah yeah good good can you also practice catching it
the entire offense is a joke and should be and is the laughing stock of the nfl right now it is absolute insanity that this team got to 110

ab needs ben ben needs ab
what are the odds of us picking him up thoughts

if im that guy asking the same question again im sorry in advance
youd think people would learn that we dont have qb money by now
why dont we just sign every backup qb in the league im sure one of em will be a hit
if im that guy asking the same question again im sorry in advance

what are you apologizing for i dont mean to be antagonizing and i am hoping for a response im genuinely curious what you think youre saying sorry to
well hes getting 10 mil next year which is def something the steelers arent interested in if they pick him up it will be the season after all these qb questions really just hinges on if ben finishes his contract or if he retires before that or if he signs another extension the way this season ends will dictate a lot he wins a sb im very confident he will retire on top if not i wouldnt be shocked to see him back again one thing is for sure though father time is creeping up on pretty much the only steelers qb ive watched and his time unfortunately is coming to an end
my takeaway from this game is it must be nice to be able to go to a qb sneak on 4th 1 when the run game has been iffy all game cries in bomb to mcfarland


james harrison doesnt run that pick back before halftime not sure we win that game ben plays poorly in super bowls

how was his face thinner than it is now and hes lost weight hes such a damn goofball
love the dude not the biggest talent but the heart to achieve greatness
damn you beat me to this lol
does anyone think he would have played better then chuks has played our line is obviously not doing great but i feel chuks is playing decent football out there

i always liked stafford and feel like he will want out of detroit before his career is over especially if he has a chance to win hes a ufa in 2023 so could line up for when ben is gone
depending on what bens planning im not opposed to that especially considering our options in the interim stafford is a solid qb
add another to the punch card
zero unfortunately
id be happy with that if colbert can pull some strings to make it happen id be even happier with darnold
what kinda drugs are you on to think we can afford him please delete this
the boys will get straight against the bungals monday night and well make our run whatever that may be

but thank god were not the raiders lol
question is our offense as bad as their defense

of note

i flew from edmonton alberta for the game i didnt care how much it cost because i figured it was the last time youd get to see brady vs ben play that good in their careers sure enough it was one of the best games and sporting events i had ever been too

the tailgating was unreal shout out to the other canadian guy for giving me free beer and its a trip ill never forget

hopefully ill be able to get back soon
you are not subtle about your feelings toward the players and i like that


too bad you have 31 other decals that you cant trade and will never use
what game is this
this is rocket league
i put a hard hat on mine
sadly this is probably behind a paywall
ok but did he catch that ball
grinded up to d2 last night with that decal
how much
gotta get that saffron octane dude but hell yeah either way
youre in the kitchen now
nice got mine last night as well
god bless
if any steelers fans want to run it on rl hmu
my son and i both got our decals last night last season we tried for the entire final month and couldnt win a single tournament even at the silver level last night we won a gold tournament coincidence i think not

the teammate we got assigned to us said go ravens after the tournament was over i thanked him for beating the browns

photo of our cars i even found a steelers themed title for my name tag

nice bought mine yesterday
dope
ill be getting my pack later
same
wait how did you get this
where did you find this how do i aquire this
nice i just wish it came with other stuff as well wheels banner myron cope engine sound something
8 is a lot for what is basically 1 skin yeah im not using any of the other teams but then again i have a really sweet wwe new day themed car design that i really like
is this a custom skin or are those available in game
wait what is that in the store
now i can have my flash car and a steelers carjust when i thought i was out they pull back me in


view poll
i dont see us dropping another game unless were locked in at 2 come week 17 and we rest our starters
steelers lose to colts or browns to go 133
133
packers will go 124 and get blown out in the divisional by the seahawks i think
steelers lose to colts and browns and end up giving the afcn to cleveland bills get 2 seed chiefs run it back
removed
ya i hate seeing lamar every time it loads and the ugly purple everywhere
why now

is it more than 40 off
who do you think gets it next year
why madden 07 is still better got franchise mode still goin


kaboly out here just stating banal facts
red hot shit up in here kaboly
wow there are still some smooth brains in that thread

he is not pro caliber
really good college qb does not translate to the professional level
not a strong enough arm doesnt cut it after november in the afc north thats like the bills drafting jake fromm
im a notre dame fan you think ben is frustrating try watching book on a saturday lol he is a good college qb nothing special he doesnt really improve the players around him
right now hes being talked about as a mid to late round prospect but hes climbing mahomes was once considered a round 45 guy and bam he jumped to the first round not saying that will or wont happen with book but hes climbing as more teams get ready for off season evaluation

hes biggest plus is his athleticism he reminds me of a baker mayfield in terms of his movement in the pocket and scrambling ability he will not be able to run away from too many people in the pros but he has a little shiftiness to him and toughness again sort of like mayfield
he doesnt have a cannon for an arm but its good enough we wont see him throwing 60 yard bombs too often but he throws a pretty deep ball one 50 air yard toss against navy that he made was super pretty honestly better deep ball placement that weve seen from a steelers qb in the last couple years

theres something to be said for production too hes done a lot not a one year wonder type player lot of yards lot of wins etc

i havent watched enough tape to see his overall accuracy yet 633 completion is discouraging tho that would put him around the button of the league in the nfl and he should be able to find open targets much easier against college teams than what hell see in the pros again i havent looked at enough tape to see what kind of throws that is if they are asking him to throw deep all the time his percentage will be lower id like to see how accurate he is at all three levels

he greatly improved his decision making this year with only 2 interceptions he took more command of the offense this year as well which is encouraging

imo we need to wait until the year finishes hes got a huge test coming up in the acc championship and playoffs he could rise big time with a huge performance or two or three

i have two thoughts one specific to the steelers and one general philosophy

1 the steeers have drafted a prototype qb for too long its always that big and tall guy often not athletic dobbs and exception id love to see the team draft a shorter guy an athletic guy etc try something different i wanted the team to draft jalen hurts last year for example as i saw him as someone who could be a total change of pace from the type weve drafted and maybe be an answer

2 this is the general philosophy idea never stop drafting quarterbacks until you find that guy just keep on drafting every quarterback that you believe has a shot to be a legitimate starter in the league we have been blessed for the past 15 years with ben but many steelers fans recall years of qb uncertainty also think of teams like the browns the jets the bears etc etc it is possible to go years and decades without a qb ben is at the end here and the team doesnt have a new qb yet to take over draft trade do anything you can to get that guy whether it is picking up a qb late in round 1 or round 2 whether it is taking a flyer on a guy in round 4 whether it is trading the 2nd round pick for a guy like darnold who has insane talent but is in an awful spot just keep looking for that new qb until you get him
as a 7th rounder or udfa maybe but anything more than that is a major reach
after seeing what became of mason no more project qbs please we cant develop them at all
doesnt matter if we draft a quarterback or not if fichner is the oc
playoffs very likely could be kc pit buf ten cle ind bal that would mean we played every afc playoff team except kc and played two of them twice
and the 4 win streak football team who looks primed to beat seahawks
strength of schedule can fluctuate drastically on a weektoweek basis i completely ignore that stat now
im not worried about our sos even slightly i am very fucking worried about our inability to run the ball its literally impossible to beat kc if you cant chew clock our defense is incredible but if kc gets enough possessions theyre going to hang 35 on anyone
and dont forget weve beaten ourselves twice
and possibly two of them thrice
wait how would both cleveland and baltimore make it
i cant see steelers beating baltimore a 3rd time
i didnt pay much attention to williamson in his first showing perhaps thats a sign he was doing his job how do we feel about his first start

steelers obviously had a stellar first half on defense and im not going to fault them for giving up 26 to the bills when our offense couldnt stay on the field what was williamsons role in this performance

i usually rewatch games but i just dont feel like suffering through the steelers drives again
hes a tackle machine 20 tackles over the past two weeks but cant really cover played almost 90 of the snaps but came off the field on 3rd and long the bills were probably the worst matchup for him considering allen threw over 40 times and scrambled 6 times

he did his job though no complaints
i feel like hes a more athletic ince illiams solid against the run but liability in coverage
seems to me like hes perfect for a backuprotational type guy but does struggle too much in coverage to warrant being a long term starter but also a very small sample size
great against the run bad in coverage
gets me alot of picks in madden

1010 would set my beer on those coasters
im willing to donate a jarvis jones card if anyone wants to use it as an ashtray
those are sweet how hard of process is that
i will pay for some of those coasters man
dude open an etsy page i would buy those for sure i would love a set of pirates coasters from early 90s cards van slyke spanky lavalliere jose lind jay bell doug drabek jimmy leyland
depends if we lose monday you have to burn them immediately theyre terrible but if we win theyre amazing and you shouldve made them two weeks ago lol im all seriousness theyre awesome
beer would never fall off of hines ward coaster hed snagged that shit for ya
this is such a cool idea my bf and his brother have a huge set of old sports cards in the basement here their mom had someone come last year and kind of appraise them they have no value sadly this would be such a cool thing to make with them did you get the coaster part somewhere or did you make them the plastic part
do they work with iron city
these are great
love it
i missed the one where tony martin catches a 79 yrd td in the 94 afc championship game i think i blew 4 gaskets that game
my ic light would go well on those
yeah id ash in those
i will buy those
pure awesomeness here we go
a
bad ass
oooh i like those great job
i love them
awesome
this is great work and idea
i love it great idea
howd you make them i love these ive been trying to think of projects with cards to do and id love to try
where can i buy them and how much
for this i will part with my hard earned money
theyd look better with ravens players they actually do look pretty nice
youre not even a steelers fan this is just an ad they do this for every team
if you dont mind me asking how did you make these i showed my wife and she was interested in trying this with some of my old cards

i love rocket league but im not paying 8 for 31 other skins ill never use

pittsburgh knights esports should collab with steelerspenguinspirates

i heard he wasnt a top 5 safety by a lot of fans of other teams little do they fucking no mf number 1
you dont throw at minkah
minkah good
literally the only thing i and everyone else can ever justifiably critique minkah about is not wrapping up on his tackles recently
is that 537 including his awful miami games
dude the league is scared to throw his way
thats my safety
he good
pfr has him as 463 last year and 845 this year
minkah is our best receiver lol
but minkah is trash

any anime fans in the sub have any recommendations currently im watching naruto and finishing seven deadly sins
the furor over the steelers downturn while justified to a certain extent has been a little much yes they arent playing well and likely will be one and done however when people like a caller to nsc ask about the backup qbs thats going over the line ben isnt throwing it deep because they probably dont trust that these guys can catch it
my wife and i dipped out of town to a cabin in the mountains of wnc for the weekend im so excited
imma leave this here for yinz who aint goin home next week

hey steeler nation charger fan coming in peace i need chris boswell to get me 24 points in fantasy so i win go to the championship it he does i stg i will buy a chris boswell jersey breaking my rule of never buying another teams jersey
what year did you guys think the steelers did their best and why
im thinking juju has to stop dancing on the opposing teams logo at the 50 before games i remember how pissed we all got when chad occo wiped his cleats with a terrible towel it has to causing us some bad karma or to use a voodoo doll word bad juju just one guys opinion go steelers go oops it was tj housmandzadeh that did it

no credibility because 2 tj watt pittsburg steelers if you cant spell the city right youre clickbait at best
no cb is going to win dpoy giving up more tds than ints even if qbs have stopped targeting him completely xavien howard has a much better shot than ramsey and tbh has been playing better than watt recently hes on pace to be the first player in 13 years to get double digit ints
las angles pittsburg los angles
its gonna be aaron or tj hope for tj but think its gonna be aaron this guys an absolut beast
how the piss does aaron donald only have 22 tackles the 13 sacks count as tackles right if so hes not even good for 1 tackle a game thats not a sack
its watt or donald i dont see any other choice
i think and mostly praying that donald already winning multiple times gives tj an edge solely for the fact people getting bored just voting donald lol


al calling himself a millennial makes me feel weird and im 36 the steelers are supposed to all be adults older than me
probably for the better smart man
good for him smart move
he had to have some access to the internet to participate in the early season meetings that were all done via zoometc unless he was actually dialing in on audio only
she looks a little excited
he also hasnt played high quality football in a year before you downvote me i present to you as evidence our abysmal run game and the fact that ben has the lowest snap to pass time of his career there are no excuses for how bad our offense looks considering the raw talent we have at wide receiver great offense starts with a great o line
bs he has a phone
wow that twitter pic lol
im gonna go with he stopped subscribing to an isp brooke not the sharpest tool in the shed are we
why is she an oompa loompa


as ben falls down not very frequent though he seems to fall on his surgically repaired elbow repeatedly this could have caused some discomfort and combined with the turn of the weather it could be getting tight and if he wants to sustain the juice for the playoffs he and the coaches are probably backing off from deep throws

my guess is that he wants to avoid the situation where he was throwing deep in the seattle game last year just prior to calling it quits

a slightly better running game with more of the same dinkndunk offense is what we are likely to see in the bengals game they would try to win it with that approach and reserve the deep shots for the playoffs where ben can progressively give his arm a try because either way he will likely go home to rest after that
nah that td pass to james washington was a laser his arm is fine if hes hurt its his knee

i bet he has offseason surgery to clean up his knee
i mean he was quoted like a week ago saying his elbow has never felt so good this deep into the season it feels unlikely to me that hes blatently lying about it
i mean big ben has literally said the hardest throws for his elbow were the balls he had throw hard to fit into a tight window not the deep ball
im thinking its a knee or both knees that are in bad shape and thats what has made him look slow and old in the last few weeks
bens quotes this week

i mean im 38 years old roethlisberger said ive played football for 17 years ive had multiple surgeries but other than just an old knee and arthritis my knee actually feels really good this week especially after playing on an artificial surface typically that is another issue that makes it kind of ache after last week it feels pretty good

my arm feels really good he said typically this time of year my elbow would be getting worn down and i dont feel that right now so im very encouraged by that

x200b

so it is neither the elbow nor the knees according to ben pretty good really good
as someone who has plates and screws in my leg any time i bonk it off of anything it hurts like hell for a few seconds and then goes away id bet you 10 this is whats up with ben when he looks like hes in pain every time he falls on it or it gets hit

also the weather has exactly zero impact on it its not like the weather makes it cold or something its inside your body lol

hes said it feels stronger than ever and i can vouch for that my surgically repaired leg feels stronger than my real one at this point
in general im very very interested in how ideas and beliefs are formed we see beliefs that are completely wrong every daybut we can kind of see the kernel of truth deep in there were familiar with the factual story the op must have read but their interpretation of the facts is not something a sensible person would make

this topic is a good example it looks like op read the news last year that said roethlisberger arm injury read the news this year that said steelers offense bad and decided that the two stories must be related and came to the conclusion that roethlisbergers arm is bothering him now

of course there is absolutely no evidence that roethlisbergers arm is bothering him anyone who is speculating about roethlisbergers elbow completely ignores that it was surgery to clean up an issue that had been lingering and nagging for years not surgery to fix a sudden and unexpected break anyone speculating about his injury has already forgotten about this throw which is weird because that throw happened on sunday it was a touchdown a big highlight i would have thought that we all would have seen it someone with a messed up arm doesnt make that throw so we should try a new conspiracy theoryor we could read the news
honestly its fairly obvious that his left knee is compromised the fact hes got the zip he does on these balls while hardly driving and planting on his is lead leg is actually really impressive just the arm seems like its as good or better than its ever been the knee is the real problem the point about not throwing it deep is still fairly valid because he is struggling to do it but its not because his elbow cant handle the throws
they need play action passes

mother of god
she looks as cool calm and collected as the boz god
is it just me or does momma boz look like shes about to calmly walk on the field and nail a game winner from 45 like a boss
my friends still bash on boz for his down year im shoving this in their face
the downspouts look eerily similar to uprights

coincidence

i think not
hey boz is your mom single and looking for a 55 year old obese smoker who is already married because she kind of reminds me of elizabeth shuekarate kid practically the only teenageor otherwise celebrity crush i have ever had

just kidding man doing good things with your opportunity is the most honorable thing you can do congratulations

edit forgot to add just for a temptation i also have the blessing of male pattern baldnesshiuh huh
this is what heroes do

hope we get him back this week definitely missed his leg against the bills

he deserves the world
his growth as a person brings me joy nobody deserves it more than him especially considering what he went through
i get more proud of ryan shazier by the minute did i hallucinate shaziers nickname being shazbot

anybody know what he studied im just curious
awesome thats how you roll
oh god hes gonna be insufferable

hey steelers fans i was here in the summer posting a quiz about random players from the steelers in the 2010s and ive got another quiz now im calling it the franchise guys quiz and its basically a quiz testing fans knowledge of some of the best players in their franchises history there will probably be a fair amount of gimmes but if youve got nothing else to do and feel like seeing some familiar faces itd be really cool if you tried it out thank you to anyone who tests out the quiz and be sure to let me know if you thought anyone else shouldve been included thanks again and have a great day
by franchise you mean dudes form the 2000 and a couple of guys from the 70s 80s and 90s

where is gregg lloyd donnie shell mike webster ernie stautner lc greenwood bill dudley wizzer white johny blood

id throw in some non players as well the chief dan rooney chuck bill bill nunn etc

quiz was still fun but way too easy
spelling is tough for these guys but got em all
til dermontti has two ts
1010 252 left
easy but fun thanks for sharing
the spelling was roughh for some but fun quiz
1415 couldnt remember dermontti dawsons name though to be fair i was like 1011 when he retired and didnt really understand the importance of linemen until a year or so after that thanks to alan faneca i asked my dad what was the big deal about him and he explained why the oline is so important and thats when i learned that my dad played guard and a bit of te when he was in high school so i didnt really pay attention to them at that age
100 in 125 pretty easy quiz tbh
fun quiz man easy but enjoyable like a comment above said you should sprinkle in a few more non players that are icons also it would be neat if you did a memorable moments type deal i feel like weve had enough for a 10 question quiz type deal

grandparents came through
thats awesome
grandparents fr the goats

you had free access to the stadium during home games no one knew if you werent actually working and you could get paid to watch games in person and you quit that job sounds like a stupid decision to me man
so youre the reason i couldnt find any napkins that day
they knew all our plays that day had video on it shoulda won the sb that year
its good that you quit and good that you got to watch a live afc championship game eff tom brady and the pats
no wonder the condiments were all fucked up that day
brilliant should have done that every game
wow lol thats a dope story wonder how many did the same thing ik i would have too
damn the job sounds like cake but the hours sucked for sure thanks for the story its pretty funny
tell this story to ractlikeyoubelong
my uncle did something similar at the 79 super bowl he paid a vendor that was going to be working inside for his uniform and took it off once he went inside

jujus like what 21 years old there that grown man got rocked by a kid we need that physicality back
i got the same exact one my gf got it for me
im pretty sure i still see these for sale in the strip district
anyone catch jujus pups insta with this cheeky post and response from juju in the comments
removed

i like the one of him standing over burfict
i love this one but i also love the one of him standing over burfict just a bit more
god i hope we sign him
i love juju
juju is a fucking treasure
ahh the good old days when fans were allowed in the stadium
i dont care what any of these old yinzers say about his dancing or anything we need to keep this man he is a leader on this team and he is so fun to watch he is only going to get better and more mature as he gets older
ill save my favorite for when hes holding a sb trophy over his head
someone should do a statue of him standing over burfict and place it at the point or outside heinz field and have another one out at the airport
hat over helmet is a great look
is there a highres image of this
my favorite is when he was on his couch watching the game with his helmet on

after he got suspended for laying out burfict
we better sign him this offseason hes the most reliable wr on the roster
same here
to think hes twice as big as was then
this has been my cell phone lock screen for over a year agreed sick picture
i can barely get those beanies to stay on my head and he got it on a freaking helmet
sign this man
did they ever catch the guy who stole his bike
awesome photo maybe not as awesome as the burfict one hes gotta stop dancing on the logos tho the tiktoks are whatever but dancing on the logos and then losing looks so bad
kinda thinking he should stop dancing on the other teams logo at the 50 yard line remember how pissed we were when ochho rub his cleats with a terrible towel bad ju ju i think we are jinxing our games



beat the bengals wrap up the division if kc wins against no and atl which they likely will rest the boys against browns so we can get mason rudolph vs myles garrett 2 electric boogaloo

maybe that jaguars playoff game is still leaving a bad taste in my mouth but i honestly like this path better than finishing 151 with a bye and having this big pressure going into a divisional game with all of that time off
we desperately need the browns game to be meaningless imo considering the only team getting a bye is the 1 seed i really dont care if we are 2 or 3
will he start if connor cant go how about jaylen and anthony
this isnt the offense for a benny snell type rb
i really feel like the run was prematurely abandoned against the bills conner and snell were getting decent gains

i also dont agree that conner isnt a good running back the games are definitely impacted by his presence and he does make decent moves in open field he has certainly sucked ass or the o line did i wont be choosey here against some of the better defenses out there but i dont know how anyone can tell me with a straight face that he has no impact on games
hasnt gotten enough of a chance hes one of those backs that gets stronger the more carries he gets but with no push from our line he never can get going
top tier mouth guard
he started a few times last season when connor couldnt go i personally like him benny snell football
bring back bettis
hes similar to connor and can succeed the problem is no rb can succeed right now
i like zone runs with mcfarland hes got quick speed off the edge but he needs solid blockers to set that edge
i would probably roll with jaylen getting most of the touches i dont think he is the best back on the roster but i think that his skillset can have the most albeit limited impact given our offensive situation especially with our oline he is probably our best receiving back and could be a checkdown option for ben ifwhen the pocket collapses should we decide to try to get receivers downfield more this week
hes an alright backupshort yardage guy the oline is currently holding all the backs back though atm dont see him ever being a full time starter
id rather give mcfarland a chance personally
hes fine oline is playing horribly right now though so its tough for anyone to succeed think macfarland should see more touches since hes got speed to bounce it outside
an average nfl back nothing more had hopes for more but two years in he is what he is running back is a position that definitely needs to be addressed someone with the ability to break off long runs to take some pressure off ben and the passing game travis etienne would be a good get
i dont think snell is as bad as hes played last few weeks but hes a work in progress for sure
we really have no good rbs so its a push
snell would probably be the guy due to experience mcfarland would get a few touches here and there i dont want to see much of jaylen samuels honestly
benny snells running style is outdated putting your head down and running directly into the backs of your lineman is undisciplined and dangerous
i love him personally but as an nfl rb hes jag
i was listening to chris longs podcast this morning and he said something that got my attention the way you beat the chiefs is by playing keepup football not playing keep away football he expanded on this a little bit but the cliffs notes version of it is to beat the chiefs you have to outscore them because they manage to neutralize even the best defenses

i was curious about this so i decided to go look at a few different numbers and sure enough it seems legit

in games that the chiefs and mahomes have lost in the last 3 years they have scored 32 points on average even if you want to take out the 5451 point loss against the rams as an outlier they still score 29 points on average in their losses
in games when the chiefs and mahomes have faced a defense that finished the year top 5 in scoring defense they have scored 29 points on average and they are 70 in those games

so if the steelers want to make a run at another super bowl and if that road presumably goes through kc theyre going to need to find some offensive firepower quickly because playing great defense and hoping to do just enough offensively to get a win does not seem like the formula
the steelers are in serious danger of not even getting to the chiefs
steelers should focus on a divisional opponent that they play in 48 hours in the midst of a 2 game losing streak in december in which we cant throw the ball deep nor run it effectively
to beat the chiefs you have to outscore them

facts
i dont honestly think they can beat the chiefs but i keep that to myself lol
nonsense

you had to have enough firepower to keep up with brady and moss and the 2007 pats until the giants held them to 14 points in the sb by imposing their will upon them rather than letting it happen the other way around

the path to success is never to give up what youre best at to focus on what youre worst at due to flawed reductive reasoning

if our guys can create the kind of difficulties for reid and mahomes that limit their scoring potential enough that we can sneak past them thats going to work a lot better for us than clicking our heels together and wishing we were suddenly an offensive powerhouse

they score a lot of points in their losses while suffering very few losses because theyre a high scoring team and a very very good one that doesnt make it a magic formula

you want a magic formula no team has ever won a game while scoring zero that doesnt mean we should go into each week planning to pitch a shutout you optimize for what you do well gameplan against what your opponent does well and hope the balance comes down on your side of the ledger
ill worry about the chiefs whenif we get there lets clinch the division first too much looking ahead rn
if they cant change how bad the offense is right now theyll be lucky that they dont lose to the browns in back to back weeks i think theyll go 12 over the next 3 games playing only backups on 13 just afraid that theyre beyond one dimensional and are stuck that way
to beat the chiefs you have to outscore them

theres a john madden meme in here somewhere

i dunno i think our defense is capable of keeping them in check
i dont see them beating any afc playoff team as they sit right now hopefully that changes but kc doesnt even matter at this point
steelers need to worry about beating the bengals with the way weve been playing theres a strong chance of finishing 115 and being one and done in the playoffs
for what its worth too mahomes and kc have zero bad losses in their almost three year run only one loss to a team that was under 500 the titans last year shortly after tannehill took over kc then beat the titans in the afc cg
its an interesting take but i agree with those who have basically said dance with the girl who brung ya we need to remember our identity right now not reinvent it i forget who bills but somebody kept kc out of the end zone the entire first half a couple weeks ago and led at halftime they couldnt maintain it over the course of the second half but there is material there to work with if the steelers right the ship and if they put a run together and get to play the chiefs in kc i firmly believe they have a better chance of winning that game 1712 than 4845 heres hoping we can revisit this discussion in late january
imo the key to beating the chiefs is controlling the clock and keeping mahomes on the sideline
theres not even a guarantee that the steelers play the chiefs this year i guarantee you tomlin and co wont even consider crossing that bridge until they come to it
to beat the chiefs you have to outscore them
there is no stopping the chiefs offense the 49ers had a great defense last year and even they could only keep it contained for 3 quarters the offense has to keep up with the chiefs offense and the defense has to come up with situational turnovers to win
youre talking about the chiefs like the steelers are good enough to even get to them lol
part of the keep away strategy implies that youre scoring at the end of those possessions too and not just fgs either holding the ball for significant amounts of time against a high powered offense is worthless if your offense also doesnt put points on the board at the end of those possessions its really more about maximizing the stops your d does make realizing that those may be few and far between the last thing you want to after your d just forced a punt is go 3 and out using only 115 of game clock in the process

but youre delusional if you think that just because you win the time of possession against a potent offense that youre going to win the game 1613 you most definitely need to put up some points against kc to have a chance
in other news water is wet
i watch a ton of football and also an avid fantasy footballer to boot i noticed our offense this season other than screens doesnt throw to the flats to our rbs that often i watch a ton of teams throw to the safety valve and alot of the times the offense picks up crucial yards esp 1st downs to keep the chains moving and also exploits mismatches like leveon used to out of 525 targets this season 61 have gone to the rbs which are mostly screens from what ive seen i dont think we use our rbs in the passing game to our advantage i understand ben throws quick af this year compared to the rest of his career for obvious reasons but i just miss utilizing all of our weapons when we need them the most also i miss heeeeeeeeeeeeathhh the man could catch a ball and yes jesse did in fact catchthatfuckingball
anyways rant over go steelers

removed
not sure the two things are related but either way congratulations on getting your license

normally i wouldnt give this much thought but given where the steelers are currently cap situation current window etc i do wonder if those jobs become a little bit more enticing this would be a really difficult offseason to lose members of the steelers brain trust especially a cap guru like khan

edit minority owner of the steelers
khan has been groomed to be colberts replacement either for 2021 or 2022 nothings impossible but i cant see him leaving
well you cant have them
k colbert said he was close to retiring this last offseason i just dont see him moving down to the dumpster fire that is carolina right now omar khan is who we should really be worried about losing

however with rumors that nfl is really pushing for a london team and no new stadium deal for the panthers theyre one of the teams being talked about moving which equally sounds unfun to try to hop into jax probably stays in jax if they get a trevor lawrence type


dealing with similar rumors last year tepper had a pretty candid take on the rumors
losing brandon hunt is what im most worried about
im surprised by the firing this team has exceeded expectations especially being without mccaffery most games plus they have a respectable defense and a good wr group
i wouldnt be concerned about colbert at this point in his career its very unlikely that he would move someplace new just for a lateral move
omar khan is the wizard when it comes to the salary cap it feels like the steelers have been in cap hell for the last 10 years yet they still find a way to be fine
im more worried about brandon hunt imo hes the guy that will take over for colbert when he hangs it up
weve navigated those turbulent front office waters smoothly and successfully for half a century

my worry over this situation is zero weve got good guys in the front office and if they head to greener pastures im 100 confident in the process well employ to go out and get some more
they fired a guy because he wasnt into analytics

the steelers are most certainly not into analytics and would not fit that bill
why would colbert want to leave money
i think i could reword this

28 nfl teams want to target kevin colbert i doubt there are more than a handful of teams who wouldnt fire their gm and hire kc if kc decided he wanted their job
given where the steelers are currently cap situation current window etc i do wonder if those jobs become a little bit more enticing

i dont follow this reasoning are you suggesting that steelers fo staff might leave for other jobs because they dont want to deal with a cap situation and an old qb who will retire soon if so id disagree with that and i think that in general us fans need to do less speculating on possible emotions or feelings leading people leaving for other teams even players in free agency for many its a job if front office executives like khan or brandon hunt leave its likely because they have a great job opportunity to be the gm of an nfl team we dont need to make up an insult about the steelers and suggest that theyd leave because theyre trying to bail on the cap situation and age of the qb

i have no doubt that tepper will try to poach some steelers staff and i wont be surprised if he does take some but i would never say that those jobs are more enticing given where the steelers are currently i dont understand that at all
colberts retiring khan is his replacement

moving on

i understand that big ben will hit the salary cap for just over 41 million dollars if he decides to hang up his cleats does he still get that money
according to 937 this morning he has informed the steelers that he intends to return next year
qb salaries are getting crazy thats why some are saying you have to win with a qb on their rookie contract to be able to pay for the rest of the team or have a true franchise qb or the cap doesnt work
ben will be back in 2021
hes already been paid most of that money
he probably will get another 12 year extension to spread out that cap hit regardless of how long he plays
we would have around 19 mil in dead cap which wouldnt be enough to go under cap or sign a big name qb
biggest cap hit in the nfl baaybee
dont confuse salary cap hit with actual cash payment the teams actual cash payments to roethlisberger will be a 15m roster bonus due on the third day of the league year along with a 4m base salary to be paid out over the season

the cap hit is that amount the prorated part of roethlisbergers 375m signing bonus he likely got paid that in 2019
thats just the cap hit from restructuring bens already gotten most of that money the bigger question is that if ben retired hes not planning to by most accounts what happens to that cap hit does it immediately come off the books become dead money i dont know the rules
cap gets hit at least 22 million no matter what next year even if ben retires or the steelers cut him we still have to have that 22 on our cap

but we would still save 19 million if ben retires or gets cut otherwise if he plays its that 41 million
hopefully they can draft bens replacement this year and give him a year on the bench to learn the alternative is the team is terrible with ben next year and the teams drafts high enough to get someone who can start as a rookie
damn were hit with big injuries on defenseand we have no running gameand just look at last year lose our qbwe cant plug other players into those critical positionsand cincy gonna beat us gees

with the inevitable trouncing youre going to give the bengals this week you should sickeningly have the division locked up with a clinched playoff berth

that being said what are the chances you rest your starters week 17 do you think tomlin will risk injury in a meaningless game for the sake of rivalry or play it safe and give starters rest before playoffs

that being said fuck you respectfully at least you arent the ravens
inevitable trouncing

hahahahah
if the first seed is still in play i bet starters start also fuck you too and fuck the ravens
depends on our chances at the 1 seed i know with as hot as the chiefs are thats extremely slim
inevitable trouncing boy u tryna jinx us huh
fuck you
tomlin will do what is necessary during the course of the game to provide the best route to success and your dad is a douche
lmaoo he jinxed it
seeing as how we got screwed out of our bye week and how many injuries we have i fully expect tomlin to rest the starters
pretty likely we start the starters

i hated the browns of old and have pitied the browns of today it has been nice watching mayfield do more than make awesome commercials

so fuck you fine sir well see you in january all guns blazing
this aged well
i see what youre doing here trying to distract me from my fanmanship duties tonight so that without that cosmic energy in the universe the steelers lose to the bungles ill fan for week 17 when week 17 comes right now i am singularly focused on the fan task before me and things of that nature
i blame you ubakerismydad

this is your fault lol
ive been waiting all my life for our rivalry to feel fair and to be able to happily say fuck you to browns fans rather than secretly rooting for you you guys to get good so that it was fun

so hi clevefriend fuck you
first paragraph is not aging well
lol
you know this is completely and utterly irrational but im going to blame you for this loss

fuck you
lmao
this post didnt age well
out of all our division rivals i respect pittsburgh and hate you the least lol
fuck you and ill see you week 17
ps fuck the ravens more fuckin dirty birds
fuck you respectfully at least you arent the ravens

likewise stranger
just fuck you too i at least respect the ravens
fuck off
what was that about a trouncing
oof
insert sad jordan meme
this didnt age well
this didnt age well
things just changed
thanks for jinxing us bro now can you please say that the browns are going to shit on us or something
just had to jinx it
eh no respect in this one fuck you and fuck cleveland
i love the at least you arent the ravens good luck the rest of the way sir

others have mentioned that well obvi play our starters if theres a chance of taking the 1 seed from kc but imma add that well also be playing our starters if the 23 seeds are still uncertain between us buffalo

between those two scenarios its very unlikely that well be resting our starters
might have to bring in landry jones to beat yall but whatever it takes

for real though i expect and hope for a rest week1 seed is gone
why did you have to jinx us
this did not age well
this is some top level preemptive trolling
weve all ready locked up a playoff birth
well probably rest ben in the second quarter but other than that i dont think anyone really also fuck you too
fellow browns fan here ubakerismydad great work jinxing them were coming for the north now
depends on the seeeeeed we will get
if there is anything at stake at all even holding the 2 seed im sure well play the starters if nothing at stake meaning no matter the result we remain where we are then well sit our guys
i think there is a good chance tomlin rests some players in 2017 the steelers would have become the 1 seed with a win and a jets win but tomlin still decided to rest players and give you guys a shot at ruining the perfect season there would be a lot less to play for this time around especially assuming kc beats atlanta
do you think tomlin will risk injury in a meaningless game for the sake of rivalry

tbh yes

that being said fuck you respectfully

love you too boo
somebody should make the epic handshake meme for steelers and browns fans with the caption fuck the ravens
i dont think we will knoo that till the final week

it really depends how we do against the colts and where the seeding puts us

i was playing with the espn playoff machine and if the games go the way 538 predicts if we restlose to you in week 17 we would be playing you the next week in the wild card
we need to win out to have the number 2 seed so it aint gonna happen unless we lose to the colts then again we would still want to win week 16 so we keep the 3rd seed

so it just aint gonna happen unless the bills lose and we win next week
i wish the steelers trounced we get one good game like that a year and we already used it up we win by 7 points maybe
fuck it rest em week 16 and 17 could hurt the ravens and 234 seed all the same imo
as others have said if theres a chance to earn the 1 seed in the final week then well play our starters if not which seems inevitable with kc playing so well then we more than likely rest most guys which will allow yall to kick our ass tomlin might let our starters play a quarter or two but probably not since weve been stacking up so many injuries the last couple weeks
i think it honestly depends on the colts game

if pit wins tonight but loses to the colts next week pit could be in danger of dropping to the 4 seed in that case i think the starters would play at cleveland
i can see starters resting for both sides if browns continue to take care of business 115 gets ya in and all 3 of the steelers bills and titanscolts are a tough match up
if we cant move up or down in seeding based on week 17 im fairly sure all the starters will be rested

if the game matters they wont rest anyone

also fuck you but at least youre not the ravens and at least youre not those cheating fucks in new england or that super cheating fuck that moved down to tampa bay
no way do the steelers try to back into the playoffs right now they need momentum timing has been a huge issue so more snaps together the better if someone goes down next man up
i can only see defenders getting some rest in the 2nd half

offense doesnt deserve any plus they need to get some momentum happning

i see the browns resting more players than us at this point in time
of our rivals i definitely hate you guys the least i also appreciate the very entertaining game against the ravens despite the loss you guys should be proud of that one nonetheless im hoping for the same entertainment tonight starters or not

that being said merry christmas and go fuck yourself
honestly im more concerned about the bills jumping us for 2nd place
hey fuck you judging by past history if the first seed is out of the question yes the steelers will rest their starters
i see what youre doing saying were gonna trounce them in order to build up that negative karma so we end up losing

anywho if we win tonight then yes theres a very fair chance we rest starters week 17 maybe even week 16 because with the chiefs win this weekend catching them for the 1 seed seems unlikely id say the only way we dont rest any starters week 17 is if we have a shot at the 1 seed still
hey buddy if baker is your dad does that mean your mom is 15
oh god
this aged well dawg check wooooof woooof woooof
this post didnt age well
if we lose in the playoffs im routing for the browns and the bills got to support your special needs little brothers
need to play for 2 seed
with the inevitable trouncing youre going to give the bengals this week you should sickeningly have the division locked up with a clinched playoff berth

if the division is up for grabs in two weeks its going to be a fun game go browns

big talk for a team with no logo shouldnt your qb be making a commercial

ayo what the fuck
sir this is a wendys
bro
so hot right now
just threw up in my mouth a little
well ok
what
maybe this went a little too far
love sarcasm
saw conflicting things online and wanted to know what was correct
yes
yes at worst with a win tonight steelers could finish tied with browns at 124 but steelers would have 51 division record to browns 33
c
where did you see anything conflicting this has been set since balt beat cle last week we win and the division is ours
yes we do here we go
si

steelers would have 12 wins and the best the browns could hope for is 12 wins

wed have the tie breaker even if that happens
yes and we would be fighting for 2 or 3rd seed i think if we win
oooo im tryna order a sexy t shirt if we win
yep we would already have the tiebreaker over the browns since a win tonight would give us 5 divisional wins cleveland has already lost 3 of the 6 divisional games
this will always be one of my favorites disappointing season post sbxl the bengals needing a win to make it to the playoffs and this happens



bonus an unheralded steelers receiver just wait
pacman jones crying on the bench after he and vontaze burfict handed us the game in the wildcard round of 2015
william gays pick 6 celebration
big play willie gay and his pick 6 insane celebration lmao

martavis outrageous and courageous catch in that wild card game

jujus karma block on burfict is up there too
jeremy hill being upset over his fumble then boz sealing the deal
they shot me in denver
jujus block will never be topped






view poll
if we lose in the wildcard oh boy
right now it feels like a wild card exit but just a few weeks ago it looked like we were looking at the afc championship to a minimum all depends on what steelers team we get in the next 7 weeks

im gonna say lose in divisional for now but i think theres still a super bowl contender hiding in this team will it come out who the heck knows
it all depends on injuries manif everyone aside from bush banner and dupree get healthy could see a real run

if we are still missing feiler spillane dotson bince etc we are screwed
no running game poor play calling tired defense every game spells early exit

i think if they show some offensive improvement in the next few weeks then there is a chance otherwise one and done

the first game looks like it will be against baltimore which i cant see steelers beating them again
this really depends on final seeding baltimorebuffalokansascity looks like the most likely bath to lv that is a gauntlet to say the least
this team tonight might not win another regular season game
i said lose in the divisional round but they can show me enough in their last three games to push me into that last category the defense is legit and the offense has too much talent to be this inconsistent even accounting for the difficulties at oline even just getting back to the septemberoctober version of themselves is enough to put them into contention imo
if the offense can figure out and solve their issues i love our chances for a deep run if not its one and done
should be a definitely win the super bowl option
after watching the first quarter against the bengals can i change my answer to lose in wild card
hmm lets see incredibly predictable play calling shit oline cant run cant pass 3 second or third string linebackers at this point theyll be lucky if they make a single 1st down in the playoffs
this team will not win a playoff game
wow yall are some negative babies today
right now im saying one and done until they prove theyre capable of something else
cant say for sure if i havent seen any improvement on offense
next weeks game will tell us alot about this team moreso than tonight will
it looks like well be going to another teams city

one and done because of our inept offense
this is a one and done team if ive ever seen it if they cant figure out how to run the ball before the playoffs its over this team was hyped to hell but was always a paper tiger this was the only time in maybe the last twenty years i didnt believe in the team and the proved me right im not gonna lie i started to think maybe it was special after they beat jacksonville but they honestly dont have a single dominant win all year this team was probably one of the worst that has been put out there in recent years my prediction for this year was 016 at week 8 i expected them to finish 88 they are just proving me right sad

what did i just read
dad youre drunk
yo do you smell toast
get rekt newb
epic pwnage
i have so many questions
fuckin what



i want to see derek watt mow down some linemen in the rz tonight





will i see that doubtful
this is shocking news i cant believe it
doesnt matter tbh
of course he is
oh no now well only get 30 yards instead of 45
as much as i like james conner and his story i would really like to see the steelers draft a good bruising back thats got some agility agreed the oline is struggling but conner has never impressed me and hes super injury prone
let derek watt play halfback at this pointcant do any worse and at least he gets in the game
this conner guy is great at being injured
hes a great story and great competitor ill always root for him unless hes a raven brown or bengal but he hasnt been a difference maker and isnt worth prioritizing on a roster with a cap crunch these are his last days in black and gold i think and im fine with it wish him well but its time to move on
hot take
conners injury history is unreal
benny snail to the rescue
line up with benny snell and derek watt and make him run
an average rb at best who is consistently unavailable ill be glad to see him move on next year
good connersnell should not be the difference in this game if it is theyre already in trouble so get conner 100 right for the playoffs after this slog of a season i am all for load management going into the playoffs
update boys

i have made the trip to cincy for the game tonight whos here
ive said it before but i think with our awful oline play jaylen samuels is the best choice we have on our roster at the moment benny is a better pure back but jaylen has better hands so he can be used as a receiving option as well benny is a power back and needs those first couple steps to get moving our line cant give that to him right now
oh nos
i think they should just start reporting when isnt questionable because at this point its every week i feel bad for the guy no doubt hes a hard worker but hes just made of glass
i love james conner but with the air attack being wishy washy with the drops i really hope we start opening our horizons in the rb game
benny snell football
we want watt we want watt

what else do we have to lose at this point to just see the man play
i love james but unfortunately his body just cant take it again lets just let him go and either draft a 3rd or 4th or even make a play for lev again since his stock has plummeted
honestly i think even derrick henry would struggle given how bad the line has been at run blocking
damn but if he had to miss a game this one should be okay you never know with the steelers though
interested to see who they draft next year if bens coming back they need a much revamped run game
glass man is fragile
still shocked about kevin greene puts life in perspective
conner has to go period hes never been a quality starter always on the sidelines
rb is a position of need next draft conner cant play a whole season
conner cant stay healthy that is a fact down vote all you want but conner is not reliable and after watching this most recent debacle vs cindy neither is ben we would be better off next year with matt stafford
it sucks because i love love love conner its going to be tough seeing him walk next year they might keep him on a cheap deal
conner has always been made of glass
not to be callous but good hes like trash
as much as i like connor hes a bit of a sick dog at this point

he was a bit before my time but man im definitely familiar with his work rest easy
what a shame i remember watching him as a kid and my parents had his jersey a heck of a player rest easy legend
holy shit i never got to watch him but he was amazing for us from what ive seen in highlights and seemed like a great guy rip
him and cowher were the reasons i became a steelers fan

rip
guys like kevin greene levon kirkland and greg lloyd made the steelers defense so exciting in the 90s greenes arrival in particular helped switch the reputation of the steelers from the mediocrity we saw under the latter noll years to the blitzburgh swagger of the early cowher years he only played for the steelers a few years but he made a huge impact he seems to occupy 10 years worth of steelers memories in my mind even though it was only 2 or 3

also as a wrestling fan it was dope as fuck to later see him show up on wcw and find a new creative outlet for his huge personality

hes gone too soon
passrushing great hall of famer kevin greene dead at 58
published dec 21 2020 at 0457 pm

grant gordon
nflcom digital content editor

one of the most prolific pass rushers to ever grace the gridiron pro football hall of famer kevin greene has died he was just 58

a class of 2016 pro football hall of fame inductee greenes 15season nfl career was highlighted by 160 sacks which stands as the thirdhighest total in league lore

greenes nfl career began with eight seasons in the rams organizations after he was selected in the fifth round of the 1985 nfl draft but he would make an impact with the pittsburgh steelers and carolina panthers playing three seasons apiece as well he also played a season with the san francisco 49ers

around the nfl will have more shortly
wow rip to this legend does anyone know the cause 58 is way too young
geez
seems like yesterday he was getting his gold jacket at half time with styx playing
thats terrible newsi remember when him and lloyd were quiver and quake rip 91
this is tragic i have so many great memories of the 90s blitzburgh steelers rip legend
may kevins golden locks and gold jacket flow forever rip
packers fan here to pay tribute those greene lloyd kirkland defense days were legendary rip
holy shit man that is absolutely terrible
wow ive been an eagles fan my whole life but growing up kevin greene was a legend horrible news
no he was a humble super nice awesome dude
aw man this sucks

he was one of my favorite players growing up i was young and can remember how stoked my dad was when the steelers got him even though he only played a few seasons in black gold he undoubtedly made his mark in the franchise

rest in peace 58 is too young
wowshocker
my all time favorite steeler growing up him and lloyd were a helluva duo
i never watched him play born in 93 but i remember getting his and greg lloyds quiver quake trading cards as a young teenager from my dad rip
watching that 90s era with my dad is one of my favorite memories im genuinely sad about this rip
he was also great on that show pros vs joes
saw him in the hof parade when he was inducted he was awesome
bliztburgh legend his motor and work ethic was amazing to watch sad we couldnt get him a ring and that was the first time i was saddened by a player leaving
this is so sad i remember meeting him at woodsons grill in the mid 90s great player and even better person
this is so fucking sad 2020 needs to fucking go
i am not seeing anything on espn yet so i am hoping this is a bad rumor or some other misinformation

edit awfuck
i camped out at three rivers for playoff tickets one year and it was freezing cold the rooney family bought hundreds of pizzas for the fans waiting in line overnight to get tickets everyone had their fill kevin greene made an appearance driving around the stadium in what looked like a chevy blazer waving a terrible towel out the window and hootin and hollerin
holy shit dude
terrible news he was a great olb in his time with us and a great player throughout his career never heard a bad word said about him either
as a lifelong steeler and auburn fan this one sucks
well shit now the game seems a bit less important tonight
i cant believe he was only with the steelers for three years those mid 90s teams were the teams of my childhood and it seemed like he was always there with lloyd and woodson
damn i grew up as an la rams fan and it was him and jerome bertie both going from the rams to the steelers that made me switch teams that and the rams moving to st louis he was one of my favorite players and i always hoped hed come back to us someday as a coach rip
damn i got greene lloyd and tomczaks autograph at centry sports when i was younger awesome guy loved watching him and lloyd together

edit phone changed greene to green
fuck my buddy texted me earlier and it blew me away

this hits me so hard because kg was my first favorite player the first guy i watched where i could tell he was great when i was 9 years old i wanted to be kevin greene for halloween but i ended up getting strep throat and not being able to go out

rip kevin

lets win the division for him
rip kevin greene was a legend

no cause of death listed yet i hope it wasnt a suicide
sick as fuck rip
rip
rip true legend on the grindiron and in the squared circle wooooooooooooooo
rip man 58 is way too damn young
fuck im heart broken
rip kevin im just glad he got to live long enough to be at his hall of fame enshrinement ceremony i never got to watch him play myself but he was one of my stepdads favorite players behind greg lloyd
i was so sad as a kid when he left the team this is terrible news rip
i grew up in the 90s watching him he was awesome him and greg lloyd were my 2 favorite players growing up
this is horrible news to say the least

i remember meeting him in jacksonville one time at a meet and greet event when we were in town to whip up on some jags maybe in 2005 or 2006 i dont remember the year but he hasnt been retired too long of course by then he had also spent time in carolina and san francisco but i remember telling him that the black and gold looked great on him and he replied once a steeler always a steeler and gave me the high five

loved the days of the 2 headed monster of greene and lloyd teams could only double team one of them and the other one was going to get that qb

rip and thanks for all the memories 58 is way too young to go
easily one of my favorite steelers lbs all time and thats saying something considering our history rip 91
rip legend

sucks to hear anyone remember him in wcw
met him a few times in person as he used to live right around the corner he was a gentle giant off the field but a monster on it

damn my day just got worse
rip legend
cant believe it i remember him as a packers and jets coach i learned more about him when he was inducted into the hall this was shocking to hear he was so young too its crazy that he coached against us in a super bowl it must have been hard
i grew up watching him play one of my fav players in the 90s rip
i actually got the opportunity to meet him it was on my 17 birthday and of all places we were at cracker barrel very sad to hear
mother fuck this year

rest in peace big man three years a steeler is too short a time but for you long enough to be a black gold legend

will be flying the colors the rest of the year
this sucks so much i always hate to hear about a player from the 70s teams passing away but kevin greene was my favorite player when i really got into football in my teens he was one of my steelers
that was a ballplayer there
fuck he was one of those players that i tell you yinzers about that caused me to love the steelers even though i was born a cowboys fan yall have had so many great ones that played football the way it was supposed to be played

rip mr greene and condolences to your family and friends
highly unexpected him and lloyd were my favorite steelers as a kid

rip
he made lloyd better this sucks
december 23 1995 i was at the pittsburgh airport picking up my aunt with my mom and brother while walking around the airport my brother and i saw the steelers waiting at a gate for their plane up to green bay to play the packers i was a huge packers fan at the time and had my starter packers jacket on my brother bought a steelers yearbook from a store and he were walking the gate area getting autographs i was getting shit from the players for wearing my packers jacket we walked over to kevin greene who was sitting away from the team with his girlfriend we asked for a autograph and he told us no and to get the fuck away from him with that packers jacket on ive never been scared in my life as i was in the moment rip
he helped my grandson practice his celebration moves at panthers training camp a couple years ago he was a very nice and down to earth man
more from nflcom


my condolences
one of my favorite players as a kid rip king
58 is way too early to go thats awful
bengals fan here my fondest memory of big kev was his run in wcw when i was a kid

you all lost a good one my heart goes out to you all
damn i bought a quiver and quake shirt outside three rivers at the playoff game against buffalo during our 95 super bowl run always loved that guy
oh man this one hurts because it is so unexpected
oh man thats a bummer
fucking what ugh jfc
third in alltime sacks
terrible news rip
when i was a little kidprobably 6 or 7 years oldmy dad and a few of my uncles were eating somewhere in pittsburgh i have no idea where but i remember it was a nice day and we were standing around the door one of my uncles comes in an says kevin greene is walking down the street

i still remember vividly i ran outside not sure who kevin greene was but certain he was a big deal i looked left

there he was an enormous man with blonde locks hanging down to his white cutoff tshirt

i would end up wearing his jersey as a kid
what the actual fuck man unreal
if tj gets a sack tonight i hope he drops to the knee and gives the two arm biceps flex
i can sadly cross him off the list of people my wife would leave me for
i wonder if theyll mention it during the broadcast im guessing the is a 4th quarter time filler
he was an awesome lb i remember watching him as teenager may he rip
rip one of the greats
awesome linebacker always seemed like a good dude too fun to watch was sad when he left pittsburgh and am sad again

peace kevin greene
sucks he was my all time favorite
rip
reddit gotta get rid of that wholesome award
i always wanted him to come back and coach the olbs when they finally got around to getting porter out of there

rip
rip man
holy fuck that is not what i expected to see today

what happened
rip to kevin greene and hope all is well and have a good one
wow i didnt even hear this news i remember being 11 years old and watching their run to the super bowl after beating indy he was on the wheaties box my mom bought me rip legend
lifelong browns fan here but id silently cheer for greene because he was such fantastic football player greene was unhinged during the play but so affable and likable after the whistle he genuinely seemed to be having fun he was a joy to watch
this breaks my heart such a good dude and great player fuck 2020
packers fan checking in rest in peace to probably our greatest defensive coach of the last three decades
rip 91 sending my warmest regards and deepest sympathy to your loved ones this holiday season
packers fan coming to say that this one is a gut punch
tragic he was a legend even to me as a fan on the wrong end of his play does he have a charity i could toss a few bills mafia bucks toward
so sad what did he he pass away from does anyone know
wow i remember him i didnt realize he played so long ago to be that old i wonder what happened 60 isnt exactly super old but for a player that spent his life bashing his head against others maybe it is
was he sick man i thought he was still coaching for the pack
this hurts to learn very sorry for the family of kevin greene
ts and ps guy was an all time great wtf going at 58
jesus fucking christ how sad rip my man
let this be a lesson folks dont do drugs

reminder to everyone excitedly clicking like i did that the game tonight is in cincinnati
if it wasnt so cold id do itlol

hope everything is good with you and your family and it all works out best of luck
just a heads up everyone op is probably a scammer i dont want to accuse anyone but i have a friend who works in ticketing for the bengals the club seats arent even open today

also look at ops post history he tried to sell tickets to a patsfins game just yesterday because of a last minute funeral and tickets to a vikingsbucs game the week before most of these teams right now are limiting their ticket sales to season ticket holders on random draws

just be careful
if only i had seen this earlier

and didnt live 12 hours away
if only i wasnt on the other side of the state
sending out condolences to all friends family teammates and fans of kevin greene i loved you always gave it your all and was a great person will miss you
my dad just reminded me that during the 94 season he and my brother camped out for playoff tickets outside the three rivers ticket office kevin greene arrived with pizzas for just about everyone there
first ive heard of that young still that dude was a savage
what the fuuuuuuuuuuuuck hell nah
all time great rip
at least he didnt have to see this game
what
thought he was talking about the season
lets win it for kevin
i hope whoever you are you are able to watch the steelers game here in nw ohio at 1 pm we have the clowns and the ratbirds as our games at least i can listen to it on the app






i feel like i should know this but weve already clinched a playoff spot right so does tonight matter in any significant way whether we win or lose
we win the division with a win tonight and stay in the race for the 1 seed
if we win out and the chargers beat the chiefs in week 17 we get the number 1 seed
if steelers win they clinch the division
if we win we win the afc north as i understand it may as well get it out of the way rather than having to beat the colts or browns for the title plus it may give us the option of being able to rest our starters for the browns game and having some of our most important players rested and uninjured for the playoffs
we dont want the brownies to have a chance to take the division
not only will winning this game lock up the division but this should absolutely be a get right game hopefully theyll figure shit out let diontae figure out his dropsies work some intermediate passing into the offense and try to get the running game going
we need to stop being below average the past few weeks and adjust our compass so yes important
clinching the division and getting a much needed win
yes every game matters we need a strong w and a confidence boost here we go
technically we could actually finish 2nd to the browns
does anything matter any more really
i appreciate all your answers this sub is my go to for understanding the complexities of the positions of teams with wins and losses ha
to anyone whos ever played sports every game matters the jets won yesterday when people said they should have tanked the game players dont tank games players play to win its whats engrained in athletes from a young age that winning isnt every thing its the only thing even if you sit the starters the backups are out there to win important or not to whomever the game has meaning













the only time worthy of waiving that towel last night was jujus dancing
would you start snell or claypool tonight scratching my head in this one thanks for the advice and good luck tonight
our oc specifically said they practiced the deep ball more this week but then again snell will be the number 1 for the day however he couldnt do much with that in past weeks id go claypool
claypool
claypool 100
claypool for sure
neither no one is doing anything


tj watt cam heyward minkah fitzpatrick and maurkice pouncey were all declared pro bowl starter david decastro was also made an alternate



tiktoks on the bengals logo and spiking the ball onto their logo too juju stop jinxing
suddenly the nfl is the crown jewel of class and professionalism
its super cringey but it quite objectively has no impact on the outcome of the game
someone help stop the dancing man
hes been doing it longer than theyve been losing hes not jinxing anything
i think its not very classy and wish he wouldnt do it
he didnt jinx us the first 11 games so why does that matter now he isnt the one dropping the ball or blocking poorly
i find it disrespectful i know how i feel as a fan watching another player from another team doing that on our logo i dont think it affects the game much though

before you come at me with the you only dont like it cause we lost i also didnt like to see it when we were winning i feel like they are professionals and should act like one thats just my opinion ago feel free to disagree
as dumb as tiktok is i dont have a problem with it
oh my god who fucking cares its not the reason were losing and juju dancing before the game has no impact on the game

the fact that this is a headline makes me sad as a longtime steeler fan
he said he was gonna do it
its causing unnecessary drama he needs to stop
i agree i hate seeing that crap tomlin should not let that stuff happen
tiktoks receptions
its no fun league
why do people seriously even care about this i doubt literally any other nfl player gives a shit let the man have fun dude has done so much for the steelers and not just on the field either
acting like a typical tiktoker
i think tiktok is dumb i think the outrage over this is dumb i think its dumb for a guy with 43 other guys in the league and three guys on his own team ahead of him in receiving yardage to be still be so devoted to selfpromotion

im guessing mike tomlin will have a talk with him about it and jujus future pregame tiktok videos will be of him dancing in the end zone instead of on the midfield logo theres no way hell quit doing tiktok videos entirely too important to the brand
i agree i think its fine when youre doing good but the team lost to the football team and are currently botching it against the bengals
browns fan lurking here not here to argue just curious as to what yall thought and wanted to give my take

my exact thoughts on this were from hs football i know it is not the nfl like dudes do definitely take that shit really seriously the bills did and they came ready to ball no need to give a top tier team in this league bulletin board material

i dont think juju is a bad dude by any means just what hes doing is a testament to being 23 and given his numbers its undeniably a bad look im a rival fan so obviously it was awesome watching him get his shit pushed in last night because he ended up okay and i love that edge you can only get from this sport

i fully expect tomlin to cut this shit out given the slide and im kind of surprised the normal take here is its just a logo

dk took a compliment comparing him to megatron this year as a diss for motivation lmao people are really not grasping the competitive nature and protect this house mentality in football
he is turning into ab jr and he doesnt have abs game to back it up move on from his bullshit i will be extremely disappointed if they resign him
its absolutely the cringiest thing ever to see grown adults get so worked up over another grown adult dancing and having fun doing no harm to anyone else

yall must be really fun at parties
this aged well
juju is slowly on the path to being a diva wr he is just a different kind of diva i want to see the guy have funbut social media should never be a priority on game day or during game prep period end of story ab was a shit human being but had the work ethic of a beast at least he produced to back up his diva shit
juju is a narcissist the reason he dances is because it makes for popular tiktoks its not him being himself or just a 23 year old having fun you can dance in the end zone if thats what you want dancing on the opposing teams logo is explicitly to enhance his celebrity
juju is a 13 year old girl in a grown mans body
fucking just stop you know that had 0 effect on ben fucking up this bad seriously grow the fuck up you asshole fucking whiny little bitch we just suck

he aint no antonio brown him dancing nobody cares
if you arent that great of a player you might as well have a tight social media game juju looks so pathetic maybe the ball boy should dance on the logo too
to me its not whether he means disrespect or not we know he is just having fun

its about the way the sports media sculpts the narrative last night they brought it up every time we fucked up and thats why its harmful every time we make a mistake its and juju was dancing like they already won the game blah blah we know juju is a cool humble unselfish dude but because of that theyre jumping at every opportunity to make him look like an arrogant hooligan or the next ab

tldr its not about how he means it its about how theyre making us look to the rest of the world who dont know him as well as we do
whats worse is that he was clearly talked to about it and asked to stop he went back and did it anyway

he was one of those pretending to be mature kids that held it back and now all the immaturity is bursting forth in his mid 20s

he doesnt get open like he used to he inexplicably seems to have lost a step at 24 and he never improved his body position to make catches

earlier this year someone still would have overpayed him now hes cost himself millions and will be a bubble signing for someone looking at him more for special teams
jujinx
juju needs to grow up and be a man
it was so fucking cringy even before the losses now its significantly worse he needs to grow tf up and be a man stop doing bunny dances like a 14 year old girl
when juju started this dance on team logos thing he never thought we would be on a losing streak this was such a boneheaded idea

pouncey and decastro get in but tuitt and haden dont
tuitt dupree hilton robbery for those three men
haden and tuitt got fucking robbed man what the fuck
you hear that other teams come get your pro bowl linemen decastro and pouncey theyre great they really dominate the trenches available for trade for next to nothing
this is a great indicator that the pro bowl is names alone pouncey and decas have been shit and got named starter meanwhile hilton haden and tuitt who probably all deserve allpro didnt even make the roster
lmao the fact that any of our offensive line is going to the pro bowl has to be a joke
i hope none of them get to go
wasnt expecting much from the pro bowl since its a popularity contest but hopefully dupree and tuitt get the all pro honors they deserve mikey and haden too
decastro and pouncy

people just voting the names as usual
pouncey
hoop dee doo
juju didnt get in for his dancing wtf rigged
how has no one mentioned steve nelson maybe he doesnt have as many picks as other cbs but the dude has been one of the best in the league
way the team is playing they sure as fuck wont be selected to the super bowl team
its nice that theyll get to feel what its like to be on a decent team again
can we rescind the pouncey nod his snaps are ass now
as if anybody gives a rats ass about this antiquated opportunity to end a multimillion dollar career

time to end this joke
2 for 6 zero yards
who gives a fuck honestly
alualau and ben deserved another spot
tremaine edmunds made the pro bowl over spillane and williams edmunds has allowed an opponent quarterback rating of 116 and has had 3 tfl the whole season

post game thread
we are wasting this defense my fucking god
remember when we were somehow 110 feels like a distant memory
ben honestly looks like shit
i really hope we score more points than our opponents the cincinnati bengals
5 punts in 5 minutes waiting all day for monday night
ben should not be skipping practice going forward you dont get to play this poorly and not practice
defense trying to drag us to an afcn title by themselves

be nice if this dumpster fire of an offense could give them more than 90 seconds to rest
these last three weeks actually are the 2019 steelers lmao
well thats 9 quarters of dogshit football in a row
sack streak record 1
anyone wanna explain to me how we could win 11 games and then suddenly be the worst offensive team in the league
finally have a full week of preparation

playing a 2 win team

a win gives you the division

play like garbage
wow were actually this bad i take back everything ive said over the last three weeks the sky is falling fast
all hyperbole aside is this as bad as the steelers have ever looked in the roethlisberger era
are these announcers drunk how is that not an h2h hit on a defenseless receiver
ben is on pace for 14 yards not bad
its too early to panic well make some adjustments at half time and come out and put 3 on the board so this isnt a shutout
if you dont like 30 punts combined in a game you dont like steeler football
how were we 110 this is some of the worst football ive ever seen
id rather we just play defense all game theyd probably score more points than our offense would
pittsburgh dad episode gonna just be a long stream of cursing and no jokes
how come everyone except fichtner ben can easily discern why were predictable
is it possible to play so bad that you unclinch a playoff berth is that a thing
im gonna run to the store and get some cheap bourbon to kill my liver can i get anyone anything while im out
hmm pornhub  10 million porn videos and now big ben sucks
literally every time ben audibles out of a fichtner play call is a massive gain
watt just got up
its 2nd and 22 coach theyll never expect the run

fictner probably
highsmith looks like hell be just fine as buds replacement
seriously what is happening with ben
watching our two sides of the ball is like watching two completely different leagues
dont worry boys we got three incomplete passes and a dumbfounded ben coming right up
who else but us could go 110 and then self destruct like this
how many injuries are the steelers gonna have

ask the nfl theyre the ones who made them play 3 games in 11 days
at this point give ben the porn and alcohol back
the worst part is the offense will come out and change nothing they will keep running the same plays that dont work over and over and over again
kicking the field goal is good decision take the points make it a one score game
announcers trying real hard to jinx us
3 straight weeks of zero offensive adjustments
anyone find it funny how the announcer said youd think the planets would need to align for this to happen after commercial break so ive been told jupiter and saturn are aligned right now
if ive learned one thing from these last few weeks football is entertainment or at least its supposed to be and getting too emotionally invested in it can literally ruin your day especially in quarantine so i suggest to maybe think about something else especially when a team youre a fan of is absolutely sucking ass
ok i was in the bathroom for that im going in and locking the door youre welcome
it turns out that the whole first half was an elaborate practical joke to troll browns fans wellplayed
clearly tomlin took his belt off in that locker room
glad to see this offense didnt change shit and theyre still going to kill our season thanks randy very cool
welp we tried their lead has now become insurmountable
tj watt 1000 sacks 3000 tfls

nfl fuck you myles garrett dpoy because reasons
man finley looking better than ben truly embarrassed
ben looks washed and looks like he doesnt care just trash effort from him
i want to be mad about the commentators shitting on us but they arent wrong
the next pharma company to advertise medication for bipolar disorder in this sub is going to make a trillion dollars
anyone whining at the refs is shifting blame this is a team we beat 3610
dont hurt my brother

tj watt
heres hoping tj pops off this game for his bro
smells like dpoy in here
i really dont know how its possible but our offense looked better at times last year with a practice squad qb
we went 110 and now we absolutely suck so damn badly
that was the saddest first half ive ever seen from us
i think ben may have been visited by 3 spirits at half time
are finleys teeth pissing anyone else off its legit getting on my nerves
tj is so fast off the ball
if you watch this team not knowing what the record is youd swear this is a 412 team
honestly dont know what to say i have never seen this team play this bad in all of my years and thats not a joke
how is taunting not a dead ball foul shouldnt be offsetting
berry earning his money

ben checking rsteelers at halftime
ok but ryan finley has the most punchable face ever
i blame this loss on ben he spotted them 17 pts
thank god hockey is back in a few weeks because im tired of watching these shitty fuckin play calls and our sick ass defense wasting away at the hands of a stupid dumb offense
defense is gassed what the fuck did you expect
i cant even be mad at the defense been on the field for most of the game have to defend short field
i never thought id be sitting in week 15 with the steelers being 112 being utterly disgusted and disappointed like this
what happened to the offense

how do we go from 110 to not being able to get a single first down against a god awful cincinnati defense

did teams find out a certain way to defense us wasnt the quick game working earlier in the year i just dont get this how is this even possible
our play book is really just 1 page with 5 plays
until the steelers hit a big shot down field

thats 10 yards down the field at this point
opposing dbs arent even scared of a deep ball cause they know ben cant throw deep smh
you guys need to chill were playing a really good 1021 te wait a minute never mind
its not that theyre losing im a big boy i can stand a loss its that there is a blatant lack of effort and basic execution it makes me sick
ben youre going to be in the hof you are a great steeler but damn im ready for a new qb
the dude wearing the roethlisberger jersey in the middle of that fan graphic actually looked like big ben without a beard
if bos had missed that i wouldve driven to cincinnati and shit on levys pillow
why do they have to show those kicking stats like thatmakes me nervous every time
i wonder if finley suffers from dry mouth
lets get this w for kevin greene
i wanna get a drink but im worried ill miss our 3 and out
throw past the sticks on third down why is that so hard
we are going to lose 5 straight
could not have predicted this oh man you havent watched the past two weeks have you
absolutely sickening

this team doesnt belong in the playoffs
holy fuck this game is so bad that even booger is spot on
either you bench ben here or you make some miracle adjustment but right now i dont see any adjustment that can help at least mason can throw a ball deep and make the safetys back up a bit
ben just needs to go into the locker room have his usual pulled pork sandwich and cigarette and hell come out looking 10 years younger
big ben lofting a ball to ebron in triple coverage and getting him killed is a metaphor for this season
as a cowboys fan what is it with commentators that just love shitting on historical franchises

not saying the steelers dont deserve it right now but my god they sound excited about this lol
jupiter n saturn lined up as steelers stuck in uranus
this thread is about to flip extremely hard
reports of the steelers demise have been greatly exaggerated

by me hope i was wrong earlier go score another one
impressed with dj this quarter
and if you dont like the weekly heart attacks you dont like steeler football
bills fans outside during pandemic

nfl thats awesome

steelers fans exist

nfl satan
lmao so the announcers are going to cry about that tap to the head but completely ignore all the shots our guys have taken
for a second i thought we had a chance
idk maybe try that on 1st or 2nd down not 3rd 10
villanueva got fucking destroyed again
started 110 and not gonna win the division historical collapse
damn that gave me flashbacks to shaziers hit i hope derek is alright
well at least their offense isnt any better than ours
it just hurts knowing that with our defense if we had a even a mediocre offense wed be top super bowl contenders
espn needs to give a shout out today to kevin greene rip legend
that run wouldve been great on a 1st and 10 lol
why have we stopped targeting claypool i love washington but theres no way he should be getting the deep balls in the first quarter
problems with our offense

ben declining ability
o line declining ability
fitchner
lack of skill at running back
ben is more concerned about not getting hit than he is about winning sometimes you need to hold the ball and wait for the play to develop rather than dumping it off sometimes you need to run for a few yards or have a threat of a qb run and as a qb you sure as hell need to be able to fall forward to get 1 yard on a 3rd and 1 he cant do any of those anymore id rather have a worse skill wise young qb than ben and it sucks because this organization is so caught up on keeping rudolph as the no 2 who is just a worse version of ben the organization doesnt realize thats not how the position is played in todays nfl you need a mobile qb
im running out of adjectives to describe how mutherfucking dreadful our offense is right now
at this point in the game if you told me that one of these teams was 112 and the other was 211 i wouldnt be able to tell you what was which
some of these comments about claypool being trash and juju sucks for yrs are hilarious
i can already here it now we need to get better and it starts with me
so bengals 3rd stringer is outplaying ben injuries notwithstanding you have to wonder if 110 really screwed with this teams psyche
this is the single worst quarterbacking performance ive seen as a steelers fan when ben does make the right decision he misses the throw and gets his receiver killed when he does hit a throw its for 2 yards and gets the receiver killed this is fucking grim
big ben im coming back in 2021

the entire fan base after this game nah were good
i wonder if ben is gonna retire at half
ben is starting to feel like late 2000s brett farve he just wont hang it up
bench ben can get any worse than what were doing now at least try something different
im about to take a bottle of whiskey outside and stare at a tree in the pitch black probably get more out of that than this game
i think big ben is more hurt than we realize
im still pissed about jujus hit on burfict it was clean
considering that every team in the league has had our offense figured out for about 5 weeks now it would be nice if we could make an adjustment
could not have predicted this

well that was a fucking lie
its like when you first start playing madden and you find two plays that always work then all of the sudden the difficulty goes up and your two plays dont work and you just have no idea what to do
was bud dupree somehow the key to our offense playing well
last years offense was better than this

mcvay we need something extreme to make people forget about our awful defeat

tomlin i got you fam
anyone have any faith at all that tomlin will make a single adjustment
ben is not seeing the field going to the first read no matter what the wr are not creating separation offensive line cant run block i dont know if ive ever seen such a drastic collapse before this is crazy
i heard jameis winston is looking for a job how quick can he get to pittsburgh
i know the rooneys are famous for their loyalty to their personnel players but could they be loyal to their fans and fire fitchner while theyre at it could they tell ben this should be his last season so shape up or sit out i would love for us to go get a halfdecent qb in the offseason wish the jets didnt fuck up and win that game so they could drop darnold
imagine if the bengals had a legit qb 310
lol who wants to bet that after this game ben says that he might hang it up
hopefully ben took a few more painkillers than he usually does at halftime
maybe dont fucking take claypool off the field morons bout time
its funny what happens when we use that rookie receiver that dominated the league for the first few games
okay how do you get the last name sample are we sure thats his name and not a mistake at the jersey factory
here we go steelers here we go here we go steelers here we go here we go steelers here we go here we go steelers here we go
when the announcer calls claypool mccloud
yo do these announcers know who our players are
benny is a certified killer b
seeing this fucker smiling is annoying me
if the browns beat us out for the afcn thoughgood god i cant wait for everyone to tell us how much an amazing person myles garrett is after falsely accusing someone of a racial slur to save his reputation after nearly bludgeoning our backup qb
there is no way this team uses analytics

our play calling is consistently low probability
bens regression in the span of like 4 weeks is pretty uh noticeable lol
can you imagine the memes if rudolph comes out and leads a comeback the week of christmas
thats not on juju if you ask me that was a bad idea to throw to him there
tj is so hot
i swear to fuck fichtner if you have a job at the end of this season regardless of how it ends i will fucking freak out
oh my goodness a competent pass downfield must be fuckin nice
if i didnt love the steelers this would be comical
ben cant throw it more than 10 yards something is definitely wrong with his arm

and thats a fumble
sorry to ben fans but he is playing bad tonight he missed claypool wide open
youd think we were the 2101 team 10 plays for 9 yards is humiliating
can someone explain to me why that wasnt targeting clearly lowered his head on the tackle and made helmet to helmet contact
i truly cannot comprehend the mental gymnastics it takes to look at the laundry list of issues with this offense and still sit there and type out maybe juju should stop dancing
this is literally rams vs jets tier
what how are the refs not calling anything after seeing what has happened previous games between these two teams in primetime
incompetent officiating allowing cincy to play dirty may lose more guys to concussions tonight due to it
fuck it kyle trask is worth a shot
how is that not a penalty
claypool has been downfield with no one within 5 yards of him a few times and ben hasnt thrown it his reads are worse than his arm anymore just a terrible qb now
we are getting blown out by the bengals
how the fuck were we ever 110 lol this shit is embarrassing
ben is not even making reads idk wtf is going on but bench him this is insanity
put mason in fuck it at this point
all 17 points are off ben fuckups
the trade mark ben throw that every team knows hes gonna throw
the play calling on third and short makes me want to punch walls
this is the worst offense in the nfl
bengals here have a first down

steelers no
this offense really has no chance without a running game im still confused about the sweep to claypool earlier
i dont think ive ever wanted to turn off a steelers game more than i do now
worst game of bens career
has anyone seen ben making a 2nd or 3rd read at all seems like hes getting the snap and throwing
the steelers have had rough games where we dont play up to the level we should ive never seen the steelers just legitimately give up like they have tonight this is embarrassing for the franchise something is seriously wrong right now

honestly feels like peytons last year where the wheels just fell completely off during the season
i have faith that the bungles can find a way to bungle
bless our defense
alright ill bite where the fuck was that in the first half of an hour
dont do this dont give me hope
id love to know what tomlin said at the half
sorry everyone i wasnt wearing my jersey in the first half we should be good now
this bipolar team took their meds at half time
hol up we made adjustments
james mccloudpool was so close
me thinks the bengals are getting tired
am i drunk or did that kick look fucking supersonic with like zero effort from boswell
diontae just showing he doesnt drop anymore lol
do not dare mention to bozgawd streak we were here when it was written
dj is a great wr him getting his hands back proves he has the mental toughness to be someone we can rely on
so worried about his free play

he threw an interception on it
this qb is always smiling its so creepy
if we cant beat the bengals there isnt a single playoff team that were capable of beating
i got so annoyed when everyone called us overrated and the worst 110 team in history but man were they ever right
at least you guys arent us
people are gonna say ref ball like that wasnt textbook pi
here comes a batted down at the line 4th down pass
lol oh well guys at least we got to the playoffs 110 was fun
im marrying into a browns family i know i know but my fiancs nephew has recently become a steelers fan and i cant wait to see my fiancs face when he opens the juju jersey im giving him for christmas
for 31 nfl franchises an offensive performance like this if it continues in the 2nd half would get someone fired before the next game

not the steelers
so apparently the forearm is a penalty but not that juju helmet to helmet we all watched thirty fuckin times
the fact that juju dancing is even a narrative is embarrassing dont they have other actually relevant shit to talk about
jesus christ he looked frozen on the ground hoping for the best
prayers for derek
anyone else just get shazier flashbacks
tj mad now lets go
can we clone tj watt for offense
if you dont like 2 opening 3 and outs you dont like steelers football
its amazing how every punter becomes ray guy when they play us
id rather have the muppets be the announcers

actually now that i think about it that sounds awesome
i wish one person on offense was like tj watt theyre soft as fuck
how does every rt in the league get away with jumping early on every snap against watt
helmet right into ju jus facemask
no way thats on jujufuck out of here anyone saying so does not know football
claypool wide open 20 yards downfield nah lets throw it to the los
me 10 mins ago you guys are always so negative

me now
this must be exhibit a b and fucking z for firing fichtner
helmet to helmet
our defense will get gassed and that will go downhill too
i love you ben and will always respect your full body of work but kindly fuck off
but we are 11 and 2 garbage
yikes claypool was wide open
these fucking line of scrimmage lobs are going to get someone killed ineffective and dangerous juju couldve just as easily been knocked the fuck out there
were gonna get fucking clowned after this game
how the fuck did we start 110
if this team gets blown out by the fuckin bungles with ryan findley in the backfield heads gotta roll lol
claypool had a td right there but sure lets kill ebron
ben with the fucking hospital passes
so were not throwing flags got it
claypool has been open so many times why the fuck isnt he being targeted
steelers offense is the cyberpunk for ps3 on launch day of offenses
yall ready to admit bens a big part of the problem yet
have they thrown a flag on anything but 2 false starts

ebron and juju were penalties
this team is very quickly becoming the laughing stock of the league doesnt matter that theres 11 wins this offense is the most tragic shit ive ever seen
lol gonna show that little shove 15 times but no replay of the early helmettohelmet on ebron huh
how long will tomlin allow ben to stay in and continue to play like trash
i wish there was a way to know you were in the good old days before you actually left them
we are getting blown out and it completely rests on bens shoulders
this might be the worst game ive ever watched
just fake an injury for ben shit is embarrassing
wow we are gonna get blown out by the bengals with no mixon or burrow a two win dumpster fire of a team what the fuck is even happening right now
ben in the huddle did you know that this field used to be apple trees as far as the eye could see
bench ben now
the standard is the standard
fuck man this fight montage has my blood boiling
the bengals arent even playing that well theyre just taking advantage of all the gifts we are giving them
this offense looks like a three year old got a hold of a ps4 controller and is just mashing x on madden
remember when villanueva was a pro bowler
2nd and 22

run

lol
the steelers are weak team and lack mental roughness last 3 decembers theyve gone 2 and 8well after tonight 2 and 9
what a fucking joke of an offense

grow some balls and either fire the oc or bench people

the standard is the standard this aint it coach
19 yards for ben lmao
silver lining punt game has been on point
i think the monstars drained the steelers talent
is landry jones still available
where is the duck when you need him
ive watched plenty of steelers football over the past 20 years this might be one of the worst games ive ever seen them play
guys i love ben im afraid hes done he cant throw the ball 10 yards what the hell im heartbroken put in the reindeer
we dont play offense or things of that nature
ill give ben one drive if it doesnt work hes getting hooked
one of the most embarrassing games ive ever watched
i hate this sense of dread
ok fuck me im a glutton for punishment here we go lets win this fucking thing
anyone else notice ben was changing plays at the los that drive fire fichtner
tomlin probably lit their asses up during halftime thats a start keep it going boys
if we come back ill shotgun 2 beers
did you see that fan with the ben jersey who looked exactly like him
haha how much stuff do you think tomlin threw in the locker room at halftime for them to come out looking like this
my pain drinking has turned into hype drinking lets fucking go boys
if minkah gets a pick 6 on this drive i will tattoo a 39 on my right butt cheek
i cannot believe these announcers
bobby harts false started on like 90 of the plays tonight
i hate this team so fucking much december collapses 3 years in a row whatever fucking asshat is calling the plays here needs to be shot and or fucking fired
rookie olb losing contain bud would never
i cant stand this dudes face
how many times have we seen this shit in recent years offense plays like dogshit in the first half d keeps us in the game offense finally wakes up and gets back in the game d spits the bit and gives up a huge drive for mutherfucks sake
damn imagine losing to the bungles
man rnfl really hates us lol
getting minkah was one of the best trades we have ever made
that awkward moment when the announcer wants to credit our defensive coaching but doesnt even know keith butlers name
unfortunately you dont always get the call on the flacco special
that dude literally shoved his way into claypool ok
losing 6 straight games is a real possibility
bruh we are going to lose the division to the browns in the ultimate humiliation arent we
this td is not on the defense but the offense
fuck all these brownie fans talking shit 1 winning season in 13 years and they think theyre hot shit their organization is trash and art modell was wise to leave cleveland because he wasnt going to win shit there
i dont disagree that that play wasnt a fumble however if youre reviewing the play you cant just disregard the fact that bell made contact with the crown of his helmet to juju that was a blatantly obvious missed personal foul
quit holding bens hand if this was any other qb hed be benched by now
these announcers are absolute clowns calling that helmettohelmet and the hit on juju clean and exactly how you want to hit

im sitting on 150 downvotes for complaining about that hit in rnfl
reminds me of shazier injury
jesus christ i hope watts okay god awful start already
chase helping him off that kid is a steeler
tj gonna rip ryan findleys heart out and show it to him like mortal kombat now
thats dpoy tj watt
tj with another tfl cmon ben pick up your game dammit
if watt doesnt win dpoy ima be upset
can tj play qb wr rb and te as well
whos ready for this riveting series of a deep ball stuffed run short pass and punt
like the playcalling honestly definitely a different script ben just missing on throws
highsmith doing well to keep the doubleteam off 90
calmm down its only 4 3 and outs and a fumble and smh
we really gonna lose to fucking bengals
im gonna optimistically call this a slump i hope they can shake by the playoffs
maybe ben should stop taking wednesdays off
we look hungry for a win after shitting the bed the last two weeks s
tj watt is my fucking hero
the defense is still best in the league but expect them and any other defense to start playing poorly when the offense can only stay on the field for 30 seconds
the things i would do for a 40 yard pass down the field
fire fichtner right now my god
man that throw holy fuck ben is shot
our defense is gonna have to score all of our points the remainder of the season then well be fine
bruh if ben comes out the next drive with the noodle arm i want a new qb in for fucks sake we look bad
the defense gets all the passes in the world imo they cant be out there every other minute and be expected to do well every possession offense blows ass
the bengals on their 3rd qb look better against the steelers defense than the steelers look against the bengals defense

think about that
umdid we just forget how to play offense
very questionable decision by ben to smoke pcp before the game
claypool was wide open too
leading with the crown is that not a thing
we watched mason rudolph throw checks to jaylen samuels all of last season and i can comfortably say ive never seen absolute dog shit like this probably the worst offensive performance ive ever seen in all my years of watching nfl everything looks broken
theyre showing this helmet to helmet shot twenty times over lmao no call no change nothing
bring rudolph in sack fichtner and tell ben hes got the rest of the season to prove hes worth it or hes getting traded to the jets
helmet to helmet
so through reviewing they had to of seen the illegal helmet to helmet with the crown an extra 1015 times and its just allowed
38 year old ben body has sadly faded right before our eyes this season unfortunately he cant play right now at this point in the season
never thought this seasons offense would bring back the nightmares that came from last season but holy fuck throw the ball past five yards with some degree of accuracy
lmao we have zero first downs in the first quarter bench ben
oof they showed the tik toks
remember like a month ago when people were asking if we were going 160 lol
yo if anyone uses this commercial break to take a piss tell me if you pass the steelers offense on the way theyre missing
ben has been the teams limiting factor since he took that hit in dallas
honestly we got the worst offense in the league right now who has a worse offense
i hope everyone here realizes how fucking frustrating it is to play on a defense doing its job while your own offense goes 3andout time and time again for those who may not know defense guys get gassed a lot quicker than most offensive skillplayers remember they are reacting every play which takes a lot more out

it doesnt take long to get tired if you are on the fucking field more than they are
after playing for 15 minutes straight you cannot blame this defense its so sad
maybe our qb would be better if he actually practiced with the team during the week
this is embarrassing
at this point i have no doubt in my mind that the browns will beat us
you think the defense just secretly despises every person on offense
ben is 410 with 5 yards those are rex grossman level stats
this is the best thing that can happen to this team rn i hope we get thrashed on national television by the worst team in the division if one single thing goes right the next couple weeks the organization will hide behind it and change nothing if we keep getting thrashed eventually it will force the teams hand
no flag what the fuck
why are there no fucking flags on any of this shit
claypool coming open again but roethlisberger is allergic to the middle of the field
head hunting tonight i see
guys ben isnt hurt his ball isnt lacking zip

he literally just cant read a defense right now like all season hes had predefined reads of short throws and now that hes actually reading the defense and running your traditional route concepts its like the lights on and no ones home
ben is getting his receivers absolutely lit up this is sad get it together old man
how does ben keep missing claypool on these posts ebron was open on another post on third down earlier in the game too does he not trust his arm to attack the middle of the field
what in the actual fuck is ben doing with these throws

hes literally killing people
great td run by snell if only refs werent trigger happy calling a play dead 00252 seconds after contact when the runner isnt being held still at all
claypool is open every fucking play open your god damn eyes ben holy shit
this is the worst ive ever seen ben play the 5 int game was better
ben deserves all criticism he has been terrible should have 4 picks just stared down chase
110 to 116
ben is playing worse than a high school qb right now
i feel like this team has just given up and i dont know why
game is 100 on ben so far
tomlin better tear some new aholes at halftime
ben maybe practice more than once a week instead of throwing everybody else under the bus
this may be the worst game ive seen in my life
its a good thing we started 110 and completely fucked up our draft position
finley available next year asking for a team
low expectations from here on out at least i wont be disappointed when we get bounced in the first round we fucking suck
i never thought id say this but i had way more fun watching this team last year
whats terrible scheme no one is ever open
bench ben
how do those offset lol
even though they dont let rudolph play in any reindeer games it may be time to sit ben for a drive
we get a huge break with a borderline penalty only to turn around and blow it
how can you not bench ben at halftime if just to send a message you have to do it
im feeling like jim mora right now

playoffs
no run game no deep threat defense has nothing to think about but stick on receivers within ten yards were fucking done
ben is scared and throws the ball too fast to guys who arent open at all
member when everyone that said steelers looked bad against a third string qb led ravens should stfu youre just a fairweather fan i member
i hope levy falls out of the booth
kinda want to keep ben in just to see his peterman like stat line at the end
the facebook juju no dance ben do no wrong crowd is out in fucking force tonight

sometimes i wish this sub required an iq test
punting


let that be a lesson no one scores more than 17 straight on the pittsburgh steelers
take me out back and treat me old yeller style at this point
villanueva is fuckin horrible lawson basically walked past him
bench him now no excuses
seriously is ben on pain meds or what
maybe take ben out just to see what happens
running on 2nd and 22
arguable the worst half of football ive seen from the steelers in my lifetime
whens ben going to start rubbing various body parts and grimacing for the cameras
this team makes me want to shit in the floor with rage lmao
does ben retire at halftime
ben has like 15 yards passing lol
all right 20 minute half time to design a whole new offense
i think id be more entertained by flushing my toilet repetitively
ok how do people stay positive i understand dont give up hope but god damn this is fucking terrible and its not even a 1 off game that this happens stop making excuses about how it will be fine later fucking get mad and stop babying this fucking team when they are playing like total shit not the defense
steelers vs cyberpunk 2077 for the biggest disappointment of december so far
unwatchable anemic embarrassing i could keep going but i think id start crying if i did
during this offseason i never thought that wed have the best offense in the league but i thought itd at least be serviceable which is what it was the first 10 weeks after that browns game and the first half of the titans game its been painful on o i dont know if its necessarily bens arm but teams figured out the offense on tape and they havent been able to adjust
maybe they should put in rudolph ben fucking sucks rn i think he needs to be taken out if we even want a chance
hey guys remember when we were 110 good times
40 fucking yards 0 fucking points a whole ass half against the god damn bengals


get it together boys i did not wake up for a game day to turn out like this mother fuckers
all i have left to pray for is bens retirement and grabbing someone whos willing to play for 1014mil try our best to retain who we can and give it another shot
they gave ben an adrenaline shot or some shit
i understand nothing
just got off work and started watching youre welcome boyz
sutton got burned and still made a play this is it bois momentum change
tj was basically lassoed around the neck that play and of course theres no call
i like how this sub did a total 180 5 minutes into the second half you guys have some crazy mood swings
why dont we throw to claypool anymore
diontae is back baby
cant say it enough man when dj is on hes fuckin on
theres a simple explanation for this tomlin recited the al pacino any given sunday speech at halftime word for word works every time
im so fucking done losing lbs man
can anyone in the chat play lb
my week would be made better if these announcers didnt have a job by sunrise
im ready to play lb tomlin put me in coach
announcers have the bengals cocks deeeeep down their throats
every backup qb has a career game against us
whoever matches up against us in the playoffs is pretty much getting a bye week
thats secretly mason rudolph wearing a number 7 jersey the real ben got hurt in the baltimore game and tomlin just doesnt want anyone to know
why are so many people saying that was bad call he literally wrapped his arm around him and pulled him away
dear santa

i want the steelers d to either get a strip sack or an int on this drive
sweet pete what kind of play calling was that
was was that quadruple coverage
how many guys were on claypool jesus
lol ben throwing to chase when hes got four men on him and not when hes wide open
imagine being a fucking idiot and blaming that last play on claypool
this is on ben for the atrocious first half
fucks sake ben fucks sake
110 to 115

its happening
big al is so horrific never saw someone get beat the same way so many times in the same game at least since the last time the steelers played
villanueva got hammered today but ben played like absolute garbage this team is real screwed if they dont figure something out asap
now they mention the pi on claypool
time to fire fichtner if we do that and ben gets back on track we have a chance at a playoff run were out in the 1st or 2nd rd with fichtner calling plays
so much for feeling motivated after 2 straight losses this is the most pathetic loss of the three

lost his balance fucker was pushed in the back should have been a penalty called on that shit
rudolph with your nose so bright wont you guide this piece of shit offense tonight
am i wrong thinking that heavyhit on juju was helmet to helmet and the bungle hit juju straight into his facemask thats still a pf right and shouldve been 15 yards on them and the fumble not have counted
if block to the back is such an important call why didnt the refs call it
why tf does the media care so much about the dancing
love how ben looks mad after that play you threw that ball yo that wasnt on juju
ill put it very bluntly super bowl teams do not play like this teams with a chance at beating kc in the conference championship do not play like this they might have rough patches or a bad game but this half goes well beyond that there is no reason to have this type of game against an 2101 team in late december no excuses this team is talented enough for a deep run but more importantly it isnt coached well enough or disciplined enough for a deep run
snell should be our starting rb until conner wins the job back if he ever does
oh fuck fencing pose
is there anything more steelers than that opening drive
this game is not starting out well
watt is up and walking off
ok concussion issues but not neck lets ride
fuck i love tj watt man
tj said if im go down ill take you with me
tj is hungry and he should feeeeeed
what better way to make your case for dpoy than a late season mnf game against cincy
its gonna be one of those nights huh
where is chase clay pool
anyone got anymore of those 110 runs
alright i believe in our offense i swear im not drunk yet
should not have taken steelers 14 the offense doesnt even look capable of scoring 14
the last time i thought ben was out of gas he threw 5 tds the following game


so here we go ben is out of gas
well this season is looking more and more over with every possession this isnt a playoff team the defense is still great but this offense might even be worse than last year pathetic
whats bugging me is theyre finally doing the right things and theyre fucking them up in fantastic fashion and i worry that theyre going to go back to the old bullshit
the level to which the offense has regressed is unbelievable
the offense just handcuffs how great this defense is

its so disappointing
astros cheated
maybe ben shouldnt take all those practices off
this is the strangest collapse ive ever seen the offense literally forgot how to play football and it seemed to happen somewhat suddenly i was sure this was going to be bens last year i really hope hes not serious about coming back otherwise this might be another ugly breakup with a franchise player
whats worse

85 and going 88

110 and going 115

well i like what im seeing out of highsmith tonight
tj watt is a man
highsmith hasnt been too shabby tonight
even if you believe fichtner isnt 100 the problem he has to go he has no ability to make a spark with this offense we went from having troubles scoring a td on the first drive to having troubles getting a first down on the first drive there are plenty of good coaches who lose a locker room and have to leave randy is a bad coach who cannot get his offensive players to show up worth a damn id be willing to try anyone else right now
tj watt is fucking amazing hope we never get rid of him
ben goes under center for the first time all year and fumbles it cant make it up
that should be all the points they score seriously its ryan finley our offensive players should be ashamed of themselves they look worse right now than last year when duck was at the wheel

edit wrong finley im an idiot
weve had rudolph and duck but can we try kermit i bet he can throw an accurate pass
we should run backwards into their end zone for them
at this point they are stuck in their own heads
another brutal ball by ben throw that outside ffs thats 3 balls that should have been picked
i hate fichtner as much as anyone but the issue tonight is that ben is sucking donkey dick right now
defense starts to play bad as theyre on the field more than the o this is the root reason why we have so many injuries on defense and will get routed in the playoffs against these pass heavy teams
today is a steeler fans dream finally blaming ben is valid and everyone is jumping all over it enjoy
offense coming back outtime to go to bathrooms and make some snackdefense will be back very very soon
randys job cant be safe right
ok boys it was a fun 110
um thats 15 yards
anyone blaming juju has never heard of a hospital pass
i dont blame that on juju this playcalling by fichtner is going to get our wrs killed fire that dipshit after this season end of story
why was that not a penalty he lead with his helmet to the helmet
ben last week i tried to not get juju killed

ben this week im gonna try to get juju killed
were going to lose to the fucking bungles lol
its not a fumble because it was helmet to helmetits gonna be a long night
crazy no flag for helmet to helmet
for people bitching about not calling helmet to helmet post replay thats just not how the rules work they literally cant after the fact
i like how these announcers dont even pretend it was helmet to helmet
honestly i would rather see run run run and punt at this point
guys i really cant stand the negativity here can you at least comment on the things we do well likeuhhmm hang on i had something for this
like someone else said imagine if the bengals had a real qb it would be 210 right now we have got to figure out what the issue is fast or we are going to get destroyed in the playoffs

it seems to me that bens arm has not ben as strong lately

plenty of time left
are we even sure at this point that randy is calling these plays lol

i could be convinced that ben has gone full rogue
anyone defending this performance is a grade a clown first quarter or not its pathetic
rams to us after this game first time
at least if they were bad all year theyd be getting a decent draft pick
time for ben to find his big boy helmet
the browns are gonna win the division by beating us arent they
if we lose this game we should be eliminated lmao
not much of a surprise at all our defense can only do so much theyve been on the field more than the fucking offense
whatever teams can only do this because ben is out for the season with elbow surgery


fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that was last year
2 yards of total offense right now

two
clear pass interference
triple coverage seriously
they just head hunted ebron
ben isnt making reads at all
holy shit claypool was wide open
yes refs give this game more of a reason to get chippy
so cincy can spear and hit us before the ball gets there ok
i feel like claypool is always open and he doesnt even get looked at
if it takes that much effort to make a first down theyre screwed
weve gone from undefeated to maybe the worst team in the league impressive
how is hitting a dude 3 seconds before the ball gets there not pi
how do you go from undefeated to this its one the more amazing things ive seen in sports even the defense is getting run on rather easily
i love the innovative play design
ben is done that is all
ben defenders rn
this is legitimately our worst game so far didnt even think it was possible
this is the end for ben isnt it
my poor heart cant handle this shit anymore somethings gotta give
07 on throws more than 10 yardsjesus fuck
this is the most unreal implosion ive ever seen
i genuinely feel bad for everyone risking covid to watch this shitshow
tomlin needs to send a message to the team bench ben or tell randy to leave the stadium
literally have negative passing yardage right now against a bottom 5 defense

if ben cant make some throws on this next drive hes gonna have to fake an injury and let dobbsrudolphwhoever in its just not happening tonight
imagine driving over to cincinnati buying tickets and sitting in the stands while the steelers have the worst half the team has had all season
ben is retiring in his mind right now
i dont even care what seed we get were getting fucked out of the playoffs right away
420 on the clock you gotta blaze to get through this one my people
so much pain i dont remember our offense being this inept not even with fucking duck
seeing all these young qbs balling tf fuck out im ready for some of that

cant read the defense

cant put zip on the ball

cant seem to practice with the offense

cant play under center

cant throw the deep ball
dont blame chase for being angry dont blame snell for being angry dont blame chuks for the late hit ben needs to put on his big boy pants and stand in the fucking pocket and stop being scared
cant even fault the defense both td were on like 20 yard fields
taunting our biggest play of the nightooopsnopeoffsettinggo figure
this game is legitimately making me sick
never been more embarrassed to be a steeler fan
i feel every week we say the offense cant get any worse this has to be worst its going to get right
lets put boswell on qb remember the time he threw a td pass
this is what we have to watch for the rest of the season the offense has been designed around these plays and these routes since preseason teams can make adjustments to improve and change it up in latepostseason but were not gonna be able to design an entirely different approach to offense this late in the season we need an entirely new offense and a new oc
i cannot even imagine how fucking pissed tomlin is going to be at the half he will kick these mfs into action whether or not it will be enough
somehow were even worse than we were 1 year ago with hodges
tonight is the realization that we have no chance to compete for a ring it honestly makes me care way less about the remainder of the season
tomlin needs to make a statement and bench ben
and some of the dudes in this sub said they should extend ben for another two years are you fucking kidding me
villanueva is also washed up
sit ben now pathetic performance tonight
he looks like a 84 year old man playing ball
were going to lose 5 games in a row
we are the laughing stock of the sports world tonight
playing down to competition the standard is the standard
i think the whole team is deflated i want to believe samuals isnt that idiotic bens play has spread throughout everyone
i dont think ive ever seen this team look so bad playing with no heart right now they look like theyre good with losing
fundamental failure
booger looks like he has been knocking back bread rolls like mints
aare we gonna just let the browns win this division lmao
our offense looked so promising at the beginning of the season the fuck happened this is a collapse like ive never seen before weve looked so incompetent on offense for the last month and a half
what are the chances we get mac jones or kyle trask is darnold still on the table for a low price need someone man this decrepit old man cant get it done
ben needs a sports psychologist i think hes playing scared and making mental mistakes

also fire fichtner
at this point i feel like our offensive scheme has been exposed and there is nothing we can do other than completely rethink the playbook
looks like we finally have the answer to who to blame randy or ben

hint its not randy
who hoenslty would be a good fit at qb for the team in the off season who should they look at
lol its funny when they showed that ben was 128 yards away from 60k i thought it was a given hed hit that today now its looking like he may not hit that this season
hopefully he goes in to some semblance of normal 2nd half ben but man the reads are as bad as the throws this is tough and he looks quite dejected
just remember bengals rin off the field like they won the gamelets this angry and passed off steelers come back im second half and win
be careful what you wish for mason time
alright good job by the defense now to reset and win the half
claypool you sexy fucking tank
i take it back keep ben in the game if he keeps doing things of thjs matter
dj caught a td pass it truly is a christmas miracle
damn what did tomlin tell them at half time
where tf was this offense all first half jfc
seriously what happened in the locker room at halftime
fichtner at half time wait guys i just realized ive been holding the play card upside down this whole time
how is this the same set of humans in white and yellow like it cant be right
benching dj was the best thing that couldve happened
if we could get a pick six i would almost forgive our team for what they put me through the first half almost
ben heard us talking shit
stop giving credit to fichtner hes done nothing
whats it with us being unable to convert 3rd short
chuks okafor absolutely whiffed on hsi block and caused mcdonald to not be able to get to his guy we need an oline overhaul big time
ryan finley died and was resurrected in 3 seconds
defense needs to make a fucking play here give up anything and its not looking good
i cant believe how many lbs have gone down this season its unbelievable
can somebody please account for finley he is running all over us on zone reads

edit what did i just fucking say
115 first round playoff loss
cant believe i spent my night watching this garbage
he smiled the whole way into the endzone
fuck this team embarrassing embarrassment way to collapse
that play is where we needed bud dupree
that comeback was fun to imagine for all of 5 secs
they run it 6 plays straight and the steelers cant do shit make finley beat you with his arm theyre playing such soft defense
stairway to 7 might be a tad bit in jeopardy
im so pissed i blame this offense for all our defensive injuries left bud bush and spillane out on the field for like 50 minutes every game
jackson is an idiot that was blatant pi
why in fucks name do the steelers always have to do this to us can we just be comfortable on game day please
oh mama im in fear for my life
from the long arm of the law
lawman has put an end to my running
and im so far from my home
oh mama i can hear you a crying
and youre so scared and all alone
hangman is coming down from the gallows
and i dont have very long
defense has been hung out to dry for most of the season by the offense and they have major injuries yet theres still fans shitting on them in here unreal
straight up gorgeous 1on1 open field tackle
ill lose it if this game ends on another ben tipped int
that could have been dpi
that guy hooked claypools arm shouldve been pi
last 2 losses are all on ben shit has been rough need to draft a qb
its been real rest the starters till the playoffs
we got out coached by zac taylor
villanueva got bitched by carl lawson all game lol
last week ben said i need to do better what will he say tomorrow
come on down matt stafford
god our ol is incompetent
announcers just said that was a missed pi
we run that same 3 wide set every fucking play offensively i have never seen a more predictable offense it is embarrassing
well it was nice spending another week with everyone even though we go to bed depressed see yall for the next one
so many people in comments about to get banned for trolling lol
just end the fucking game
historic collapse never seen anything like it
national monday night game to win the division against one of the worst teams in the league with a qb no one has ever heard of and they got stomped i doubt they win another game
benny snell is not the reason for having absolutely zero run game and no play action threat offensive coordinating needs to be recycled three games ago
im so fucking conflicted i loathe mason but we cant keep whatever the fuck possessed ben on the field just run the wildcat with henry mondeaux
this is honestly the worst half of steelers football ive ever seen now i know ive been spoiled but i have watched the tommy maddox and kordell stewart days
bills fans gathering outside in the pandemic should be derided not admired
next years draft lb lb lb lb lb lb
game on the line 3rd and 10 and you throw it deep into 4 dudes
some mofo is working second shift and avoiding the internet thinking ill go home after work crack a beer and watch my steelers get back on track versus the lowly bengals
unpopular opinion i miss ab he was a crazy ass mf but oml was he consistent
ben is recharged yinz bout to witness large benjamin complete a 10ish yard pass maybe
this finley dude is tough as fuck major props to him
danced for tik tok

ok boomer calm tf down you cannot possibly look at that catch attempt which was set up for failure at the start and think well maybe if he was more mature he would have held on after helmet to helmet contact
drive 1 incomplete pass 2yard rush fails to pick up the difference incomplete pass

drive 2 5yard pass incomplete playaction fails to pick up the difference incomplete pass

drive 3 fumbled snap

drive 4 2yard loss on screen 5yard rush fails to pick up the difference incomplete pass

drive 5 incomplete pass 3yard screen fails to pick up the difference pass fumble

x200b

do we need a gofundme to buy randy fichtner a oneway ticket to del boca vista
i hope tomlin commits crimes when disciplining this team at the half
unsportsmanlike conduct is a dead ball foul holding isnt enforce the holding then the dead ball foul should have been a first down for pittsburgh these refs are really bad
id like to see matt stafford as the steelers qb next year
i have now calmed down from earlier and i regret what i have said in anger tonight
this clown is calling for a rtp but they didnt say fuck all about juju getting hammered
getting 11 straight wins and then dropping 3 straight including to washington and cincy is the most steelers and 2020 thing ever at the same time
since the post i made immediately got marked as spamat least i assume thats what happened weve got 5 pro bowlers tj minkah cam decastro and pouncey everyone but decastro is a starter
can we all agree wed rather have the muppets all game than the espn crew
lmao idk why but it makes me laugh that claypool is jujus camera man
under thrown is an understatement
oh thank god hes walking
the ref trying to push tj back away from his brother when hes knocked out and clearly injured is peak nfl reffing
tjs going to be out for blood now look at the look on his face he looks like a lion stalking inside its cage
where is ray ray mcdonald tonight
ik our offense is shit but holy damn our defense is gorgeous
do you think we could get tj to go both ways and play on the o line too
the watts send their regards
tj after every tackle
seriously ben what is this shit
this is going to be a frustrating one i can tell
i like washington but why is he the wr we go deep toss up to the last few weeks the shortest 4th wr makes no sense especially when the qb underthrows him he cant defend a bad pass
first one to three first downs wins
i would like to buy 1 offense please
stop blaming the coaches you cant complain same three plays every series then list a completely different set of plays every time right now for reasons that arent 100 clear the running backs cant run the ol cant block the qb cant throw and the receivers cant catch thats not on the coaches

shit we just ran play action twice in a series for the first time sincewhat charlie batch

the guys have to execute or it doesnt matter what the play calls are
the colts are gonna fuckin stomp this team
lmfaooooo defense keeps getting shafted week after week with how close other teams start their possessions
why has ben regressed so hard
this is how we get our d gassed by the 3rd quarter
the bengals are 2101 and playing their 3rd string qb of course it cant just be easy
i love the steelers but with how uninspired the offense plays i would rather do something else with my time
the sack streak continues
at least the sack streak continues
tj highsmith with some nice pressure too
jesus christ watt have my babies
watt dpoy no question
71 sack streak
well at least the d took care of business keeping them to 3 with that nasty field position im okay now if only the offense can get going
steve levy making shit up about a facemask is bush league
tj just doing tj things yanno
this offense doesnt deserve this defense
come on folks its only the bengals we can spot them a few points before we crush them also having plenty of beer helps me through each week
the thing that makes highsmith so good is how quick he is off the line every play also he looks much bigger than he did in college so im excited for what hell look like next year with better conditioning
everything about espn is trash
claypool needs to be on the field
im convinced this team watches zero film we come into each game running the same bullshit and have no scheming
man something is definitely broken with this o
3 and out on 1529 drives it feels like it lmao
hey a 4 yard run
at this point we have to have one of the worst offenses in the league
is claypool dead why tf is mccloud in on 3rd down over claypool
ill defend ben any day of the week but he does not have his spark right now and he needs to shape up asap
looking like mannings last season in denver just no zip
yeah hes definitely hurt lmao
theyre airing out jordan barrys leg lmfao im dead
bens thrown three passes that should have been picked and lost a fumble he looks fuckin dreadful
this is i think the worst looking offense ive seen ever including last year
ben makes 20 million a year and practices once a week for 6 months let that sink in maybe build chemistry with your receivers
right tackle getting a head start against watt again lets see if it gets called
tj just got triple teamed on that play
fuck coming down on frozen turf
ouch thats a concussion
even finley making the deep pass look good
watt being triple teamed
i dont want to hear anything about optimism after we just started like that given the past 2 weeks we are probably gonna be the 3 seed and have to go to colts or browns and get embarrassed
juju needs to stop dancing
tomlin sux

please just go back to facebook
bens thrown more balls to the bengals then the bengals have
another throw behind the line with little pressure why
get ben out he isnt learning
helmet to helmet
panic button something is very very very wrong here
he crowned juju
claypool is still running if roethlisberger has any interest in throwing anything except drag routes 7 yards short of the sticks
has ben been hiding an injury for a couple weeks this is getting way worse
ben leaving his guys out to dry i hate to say it but mason time
claypool was wide open over the middle hed still be running
ben is playing so bad also no call on helmet to helmet w the crown
december 21 2020 9pm on mnf in cincinnati ohiothats when hof ben roethlisbergers career came to a sudden and immediate end

ben is going to get juju hurt im sick of seeing him dump it off to him when theres two guys ready to blow him up
helmet to helmet much
wtf do they do all week
regardless of outcome that pass was a yard behind the line of scrimmage on 3rd and 7 with two guys right on top of the wr
great so its a catch when we fumble against the bengals in 2020 but an incomplete pass when its a td against the patriots in 2017
lead with crown of helmet throw the fucker out
it bothers me that you can replay whether something is a fumble but not whether the hit was illegal and dangerous
and when we dont want a catch we get one smh
claypool could have caught the ball and danced on their logo before picking up 20 more yards
leading with the crown has been illegal since before all the concussion stuff thats a bs no call
im not enjoying watching this offense it feels just like last year painful to watch makes you want to turn the game off when they have the ball they dont deserve this defense
im about to get out the devils lettuce
this game is like watching the jets play themselves
why do i feel more pain watching the offense this year than i did last year
im still here but ben looks real bad
third year in a row of a december melt down
bene saying it for weeks making ben throw these quick short passes 50 times a game is too predictable defenses dont really have to game plan for anything else
finally get a game at a normal time without collingsworthless announcing and this offense just sucks the life out of me
getting shredded by finlay hes playing betta then ben smfh
fuck his shit im going to go watch attack on titan
we dont even have a fucking first down
cincy without burrow and mixon is probably the worst team in the nfl

let that sink in

100
people blaming tomlin are literal clowns btw dont keep that makeup on before bed its bad for the skin
even if we win it should be safe to assume we should stay out of rnfl or any sports outlet we look so fucking bad
i just feel so bad for our defense
i will always love the steelers but i cant really say im excited to watch them in a playoff game this year this offense just isnt very good right now
i swear if we go 3 and out on the next drive im turning off the tv for the night
crazy that the steelers went 110 and then will enter the playoffs on a losing streak
i meanwhen the defense has been doing 90 of the work can you really be upset with them at this point
not gonna score 10 points

well maybe during garbage time once the bengals are up 30 in the 4th
alright guys three more 1 yard drags where a receiver gets killed then we can be told that the receivers need to play better maybe throw in a terribly underthrown deep ball somewhere
someone find duck hodges you cannot convince me him last year wasnt better than ben has been the last 6 games
ben gets one more drive after that you gotta bench him
3rd and 1 should not be this difficult to convert
give randy fitchner credit

lol no i absolutely will not
smoke em if you got em boys this is gonna be rough
where the fuck was the flag i cant watch this shit lmfao
ben is only throwing hospital balls jesus
keep highlighting the fact that claypool keeps getting open and ben just is blind cant hit them feelsbadman
wow fuck these refs i hope a bird shits on their face
how is that not a penalty
claypool wide open again ben you fucking bum
you know shits fucked on offense when we celebrate getting a first down lol
refs just arent throwing flags tonight lmfao ebron got hurt by the safety before the ball got there and nothing laughable
pass interference all day long not sure what that jackass ref was staring at
bens not even trying anymore
at this point i have no faith in this team beating any of the playoff teams let alone more than one
chase claypool should have two touchdowns right now
i remember when i got downvoted for saying that ben is washed
does ben hate claypool
attempted murder on juju and ebro damn bungholes
well we gave it to claypool
ben should have 4 picks right now
guys dont criticize ben or youll be told to root for a different team
were a fucking laughingstock though we deserve it
if you cant throw the ball we will replace you with someone who can
the best part of this is how ben will take all the blame after the game and then practice once this week
whos got there i wanna die memes ready
this is embarrassing
im shocked i really didnt think after these past few weeks we could actually get worse a new low my optimism has run out
ok so weve lost but lets see if we can get a fg at least to avoid the shut out
first round exit here we come
never seen a team absolutely collapse in on itself to this degree before like everyone just gave up
is mike crying me too mike
ok that planets aligned comment is pretty funny
were done at least we swept the ratbirds
this is so painful i was so excited going into the year and then when we were 50 i was elated now this is just awful
first we lost to a team with no name and now we are losing to a team with no qb
ben is actively trying to get all of the receivers hurt with these throws
colts and browns are going to destroy us
how have we gone from 110 super bowl contenders to this
another murder ball guy was lucky he didnt get hit
i find it funny how steelers fans are having their yearly fire mike tomlin tirade and this start is so clearly on big ben
wtf do they even do at practice on offense
shouldnt the unsportsmanlike only be enforced
rudolph goes in or we riot
again they arent calling the dbs getting their early ebron is out the game because of it
bench ben
its the holiday season so lets give rudolph a chance
you gonna do something ben or just get pouty
tomlin might set a new record for f bombs at halftime tonight with this performance
man i cant even express my frustration sitting on my couch right now how do these guys feel
im drunk
zac taylors infinitely punchable face makes me miss marvin lewis
bengals get the ball to start the 2nd half this might be a very ugly score when the offense gets the ball next
worst steelers game youve ever seen this might be it
it wasnt a great 2020


then we got 11 straight games


i wanted to believe
you have to wonder if the steelers defense get deflated by watching the offense
i dont think ive ever been this embarrassed as a steeler fan
bench ben
wow bengals are 2and10 lol wth is wrong with steelers
oh god ben he needs to be sat on the bench utterly insane how hes killed this offense
that was a bomb of a punt
i mean truly is this what our team is now ben really runs this team doesnt he and this is how we will go out
jordan berry is having a good game at least
we really gotta score 17 unanswered points against the bengals
whoever had steelers crapping the bed under december on their 2020 bingo sheet congratulations
were down to cheering for good punts now brutal game announcers laughing at us and we are embarrassing ourselves
ben just needs to jerk one out at halftime and hell come back and throw for 300yds and 4tds
did the warranty on bens new arm run out
but but i was told barely beating a covid ravaged ravens team is fine
when people say that bud dupree isnt a priority to sign im gonna show them tapes of the games since hes been out they are just embarrassing highsmith
depression
29 plays for 40 yards i dont care if the season gets thrown out at this point just for the love of god fire randy
someone call charlie batch
in three weeks

we have gone from contenders to one and out

ben has aged 30 years
ben is the issue here randy has dialed up some deeper throws and been has just missed and or made bad reads and decisions defense isnt at fault theyre gassed only let in 124 yards turnovers and bad qb play that is all
as an arsenal fc and steelers fan the past few weeks has been beyond painful for me
this game was where my last bit of hope rested it was supposed to be a get right game where we blow them out that ship has sailed and i have no hope left its over
if mason rudolph had that first half duck would be starting for the second one
if ben keeps playing like this were going to draft qb upcoming draft
this first half demoralized me i dont see us turning it around the rest of the season id be very surprised if they do anything but crumble in the playoffs
tell ben he has the next drive to prove it otherwise hes benched we dont play in our fears and have to be brutally honest ben aint getting it done right now
good thing we didnt spend the million to get jameis winston for games like this
weird feeling we score 240 in the second half
which one of you guys stole finleys upper lip
a shot of jger and a shart is coming up for me
damn they really reused the campfire graphic
amazing what happens when you get claypool the ball
chase and diontae les gooooooo
do my eyes deceive me ben actually throwing a ball on target over 10 yards deep
lmao did anyone else just do their lowest energy td celebration ever
ben rolls like 14 bad throws then throws that perfect ball
now please let us actually use this momentum
wtf just happened
the ol put amphetamine in the smelling salts must have done the trick
that was the most visceral reaction ive ever seen ben have
lucky d there nice to get the arms up
more holding on tj
ah you think your team sucking at football is your ally you merely adopted the suck i was born in it molded by it i didnt see a winning season until i was already a man by then we were kicked out the playoffs in our first appearance in 14 years bane
bro what if we scored on two straight drives wouldnt that be like cool or something
did ben do some lines at halftime
fucking announcers trying to jinx bos
dont worry guys i called tomlin
only down 7 loads of time lets fucking go
this is getting interesting now wonder what happened in those locker rooms during halftime

anyone else see a fat ben lookalike on the zoom
whatever happened during halftime needs to happen more often and earlier we can win tonight folks its possible
did griese just say the afc north hasnt had a wild card team since 2005 there were multiple year stretches of 2 even 3 teams since then
what if we are sucking on purpose so people cant study us on tape
ive been a negative nancy all night and im done lets fucking go i want to bury the city of cincinnati in tears i want to end this fucking franchise fuck ohio fuck cinci fuck skyline chili who dey a bunch of fucking pussies lets fucking gooooooo
i think fichtner finally decided to turn to page 2 in the playbook
why run that in shotgun
unreal run it on second and one i dare you randy we wouldve gotten the first
bengals are due for a turnover i refuse to believe they can be good or lucky for any prolonged period
thats a shoulder hit you fucking moron
is lawrence timmons still available
the steelers have traditionally had really strong lbs and we would have had that this year if not for injuries
add it to the multiple pi calls they missed
this officiating crew had a steeler game earlier this year and they were fucking awful they havent improved
a forced to would be sick
defense shtting the bed in the 4th
i dont understand why we arent stacking the fucking box its clear as day finley doesnt want to throw the ball
finleys kept it and weve bit so many times tonight goddamn
well the comeback was fun while it lasted
embarrassment of a game which of these 3 consecutive losses is considered the wake up call
turns out being on the field most of the game and being on our 17th string mlb is negatively affecting our defense who knew
people blaming defense now when they have 17 of their 24 off turnovers on our side of the field foh
bro if i saw the burger king surrounded by his employees walking up to me like that i would shit my pants
we started 110 and were going to finish 115 unbelievable
another one of bens passes dropped
lucky but right call
alright that was legit dpi
glad they scored the td but this offense just doesnt score fast that drive took over 5 minutes
we wasted so much time needing 2 scores lol
we need a minkah picksix
okay okay the bet is now minkah pick 6 and i tattoo a 3 on the left cheek and 9 on the right bold font
bailed out that was clearly dpi man wrapped his arm around him and jumped on his back 2 seconds before the ball got there
ben blew off fichtner on the sideline right after the pat
our d out here making ryan finley look like ryan tannehill smh
i need him to stop smiling all the damn time
how is this the offensive line that got burrow killed
why do we let them get 3 yards after contact everyfucking time
good read minkah
minkah and making huge plays name a more iconic duo
minkah thank you
we used to have this one guy that always came up big in these spots
getting paid millions to play like bitches
3rd and 10surrounded by defenderswhy
stupid ass play calls that drive randy went back to being randy
you need 10 fucking yards
weve resorted to flacco tactics sigh
thats the offensive play calls you go with lmao
have so much time a timeout the 2 minute warning and 2 downs to get the first why are you throwing over them mountains
what kind of 4th down screen play will we get here
i hate this team
welpthey lostto the bengals
what a pathetic fucking effort from this team im ashamed for them
never went from a passionate to apathetic steelers fan this quickly
villanueva is trash
god dammit we had fucking johnson open on the go route too rip
al has been eaten alive all night
nobody will be fired nothing will change fuck off
fichner should be canned yesterday the play call on that last drive is literally fucking nes tecmo level shit down b doesnt work every fucking play you smoothbrain
villanueva is not good
another game of offensive implosion defense allowed 7 points not off turnovers offense went 4 and out when we needed a touchdown to tie the game

now announcers are saying that should of been a pi fuck off
i hope were playing like shit to fool teams in the playoffs by thinking they have an easy win
113 boys fuckit bring on indy
ben knows i dont think he will be back next year

people blaming juju are just dumb as fuck lol if yall think thats why we lose you are not very bright lol
claypool open on the post but ben forces a throw into triple coverage what happened to you man
we need to rebuild this offense dont pay james dont pay juju get some offensive lineman in here and a good running back or else were not doing shit
big ben im coming back for the 21 season

everyone please dont
steelers might be the worst team in the nfl right now seriously name a team that they could beat
steelers not winning the division after going 110 would be the biggest meme since 283

change my mind
they didnt get a free play because the oline moved you dumbass commentator
for everyone hating on the defense theyve been on the field 90 of the game
stop it with the dance on the logo who the hell cares this team looks terrible and it has nothing to do with juju ben looks lost out there the defense has been on the field for 25 minutes in a 30 minute half they turned the ball over 3 times and they cant run the ball do you think any of that is because juju did a tik tok dance fuck no
the commentary was 100 on point theres no point on running any play action because there is no real threat of a run lbs arent respecting the run

i dont know whos going to respect us going forward we arent making it past the fucking jets at this point
announcers reaching like motherfuckers
so were just not gonna talk about the fact that juju got hit in the face helmettohelmet on that cant they review that pet and flag them
game over our offense cant score 10
im straight up not having a good time
ebron throw to claypool i dont want to die

big ben no i dont think i will
running game not afraid deep ball not afraid the limitations of the steelers have made the bengal defense scheme easy might as well be playing maden against a 6yearold
i like the fg make it one score dont know what all yinz are on about go for it
all of you lurkers from other teams can suck my god damn taint fuck off and get a life
3 turnovers to none

hard to overcome that
i am so angry at ben and juju but i dont know what to say ben was absolutely horrible and juju puts a target on our backs every week so he can show off to a bunch of 12 year olds on a video app fuck this
the on pi call on 3rd and 10 was on of the worst no calls ive seen literally made contact and tackled claypool like 6 seconds pre ball getting there
if this is what ben has left he shouldnt come back if this is what he shows the rest of the season we shouldnt let him

we could also clean house on the oline and probably fire fichtner
booger just said by a lot lmao
looking at these expert game picks i feel like these experts havent seen us play against a 3rd string qb before or else they might not be predicting a blowout on paper they should and i hope they do but we all know this team likes giving us heart attacks
ill bet a lot on us wasting our first possession
hey charlie batch in for wolf on the radiocast tonight a world class backup till the end of time
first throw nearly an interception lol
oh fuck my man says everybody relax thats not a drop
that looks bad fuck
still throwing 7 yards short of the sticks dj still has to beat two lbs who have a bead on him to get the first just so fucking stupid
holy fuck
jesus christ please be able to move he looked lifeless
glad to see watt get up hope hes ok
tj just built different
watt avenging bro
tj getting fiiiiireddd upp
at least we got d
mmmm yes tj hungry
thank god for watt
yeah lets go ahead and leave a te on tj watt
so anemic offense aside i have been thoroughly impressed with how berry has improved since bringing him back it feels like his punts have gotten so much better
tj hungie
i like that play call especially since he caught it
man i wish ben would just do us a solid and retire hes looking worse and worse as the season goes on and now i hear he wants to play next season
these passes arent even catchable
ben looks like doodoo
ben has almost no time hes getting hit every throw
ben really is not very good huh
what is the deal with ben is he playing hurt the drop in accuracy from his play in fall is fucking crazy
great hustle by highsmith on that one
are you fucking kidding me
this offense is fucking garbage
115 or 124 with this game ending with a one score lead first round playoff exit
this team peaked wayyyyyyyy too early
is ben on drugs tonight
our expectations were low but holy fuck
what the hell happened to our offense
you can retire ben
i mean are we just trying to give the browns the division at this point
how are yinz blaming the center when ben cant even grab a ball placed directly into his fucking hands
of course when you take 99 of snaps from shotgun this happens
so i guess were just done being good at offense
we have played like clowns these last 3 games sigh
ben being petty because he doesnt want to be under center thats what i am choosing to believe better than being incompetent
our only hope is tj or minkah for 6
watching the offense so far
our team went from looking pretty damn good to one dementional really quick
defense is the absolute saving grace of this team they deserve a better performance from the offense
3 should be enough
man if highsmith wraps him up that is his sack and not tjs
tj carrying rn
the offense doesnt deserve this defense
the bengals arent scoring unless our offense scores for them
wanted to go the game thread in nfl like i do for almost every mnf game but forgot how much people hate the steelers lol
my guess is ben injured his shoulder again recently and isnt telling anyone because at this point his next injury is probably his last
dpoy say it with me d p o y
i just looked it up tj watt is leading in sacks now at 13
highsmith has potential you have to wonder if they are hiding an injury on ben
a fucking safety just chucked av to the ground hes so terrible
how do you go 112 then play like this
this reminds me of last year steelers
holy shit a running back hitting the hole
7 yards rushing compared to 2 yards passing who said we cant run the ball
ben is definitely part of the problem along with our o line ben throwing 3 yards or less only hurts us
god ben is bad
i wish we had a back up qb to put in
this offense is putrid
the fuck is dj doing fight for the ball you lazy fuck
im convinced ben is hurt his throws look like a prepubescent girl
this is the worst start to a game i have ever fuckin seen put mason in for fucks sake we should have two interceptions against us to go along with our one completiontotal bullshit
the bengals 3rd string qb looks better than ben right now
ben must be hurt he looks like ass
is this bens worst game ever
i think i am going to go outside and shovel the front yard should take a few hours
why is the bengals qb always grinning he looks like the fucking joker
should we sign finley
defense is going to be worn out by the middle of the 2nd quarter at this rate
at least its muppet night football
boy i sure am glad ben didnt practice on those days off hes definitely not a major problem for our offense
this feels like the 1990s steelers good if not great defense ass offense
ben needs to retire he said it himself if he cant play at a competitive level hes done dude needs to retire this year
lmaooo bell called him out for dancing on logos too this week i dont even feel bad
what happened to our offense between like week 4 and today
defenses love to play us they literally know the plays because we havent adapted hahahahahaha
we might lose this 30
shouldve been a flag
ben has to be hurt no other reason why hes playing like dog shit
thats a penalty but ok
ben had chase wide open and ben threw it to juju anyway
are we tanking and no one told me
claypool openup the middle there wtf
3rd and 7 better throw a pass to the los
these announcers suck as much as our play
idk anymore man this is embarrassing
ben is so ass
suicide pass jesus ben
wheres the helmet to helmet ahhh good ole nfl officiating
the browns would embarrass this team right now
12 yards and two turnovers in five drives thats fucking spectacular
claypool wide open for a first down but lets throw it to juju behind line if scrimmage to get lit up
idk if i even want to be in the playoffs
this offense is so bad its comical we obviously didnt prepare for this game at all and just hoped the bengals would roll over disgusting
sorry folks this offense is unwatchable
we fucking deserve this im still gonna cry tho
can someone recommend me to a psychiatrist
well that was a shit quarter
bud dupree was the glue of this team apparentlycause this aint the 2020 steelers anymore
if i see one more wr screen im going to throw my phone
what a waste of a season for this defense
i bought a canadian lager 6 pack for the game throw mapletron the ball damnit
bro like the defense can only do so much
so when are we firing randy fichtner
i think ben needs to get fat again skinny ben lacks strength ben is to fat as sampson is to hair
alright defense you need to step up the offense for us to have any chance
i need some answers from ben if hes playing hurt i get it but a 3rd string bengals qb is outplaying him hes been playing shit in games consecutively but it isnt concerning enough for him to show up to practice on wednesday like what the fuuuuuuck
any points here feels like an insurmountable lead
christmas is canceled
defense could only carry this team for so long
im ready for basketball at this point
were going to be the first team to ever start 110 and lose the division
boy this must be how the rams felt yesterday
i blame that td on ben
this is not the same team as our first 11 games

injuries dont help but our loss of talent is a scientific wonder
idk whats worse the steelers or the mnf announcing team
the bengals have run 21 offensive plays to the steelers 7
memba when we were good
worst 112 team ever
i feel bad for our defense everyone on our offense needs a wakeup call
it is infuriating that a bad team with nothing to play for looks better prepared more fundamentally sound and like they care more than the steelers
if the team is paying fichtner a single penny he should be charged with theft is there a worse oc in the league relative to the talent he has
did dobbs dress
fun factthe last time this offense was good was vs the bengals
id almost kill for a pass good enough to be dropped about now
how is that not a pi call there
alright this is the start of our comeback and road to a super bowl championship
bad no call but theres a triple coverage throw holy shit give me mason
i hate to say it but bench ben its not his arm its his eyes i dont know what hes seeing out there
holy fuck refs missing 15 yarders all over the place
im pretty high and drunk and im pretty sure i could make better choices than ben right now
hello are these refs absolutely blind
clay must be fuming right now man
snell carrying this offense lmao fucks sake
the most telegraphed play ive ever seen
the oline is soooooo baaaaad
this going to get ugly
that announcer though lmao
okay not a couple he has 12
i know absolutely nothing about football yet i knew that was gonna be a claypool run
has ben had a stroke
ben needs benched now before our team kills each other
bench ben please
highstepping at the 50 i have no words other than we deserve this
straight to him ben is starting to look like he did last year presurgery the patsseahawks games were rough
yep turning it off man i cant what is this shit
bens done playing football he should never see the field again
ben is done
oh my god that big ben wants to play another year thread gonna age real bad real fast
can we afford a qb in free agency
everyone is so frustrated absolutely falling apart
jusy dont throw it into coverage holy shit
at least roll over and die with grace you fuckin cowards
this just makes me sad like im just at a loss there is no silver lining there is no fight in this team
were getting utterly embarrassed on national tv
defense is gassed already
does our defense still score asking for the offense because they are dog shit today
ill say it its not his night pull ben
you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain ben probably
did the bengals and steelers switch uniforms before the game or something
115 season incoming
its over i miss the early 2000s and those no nonsense teams
this is embarrassing
i wouldnt be surprised if bens knee swells up at half time and he cant play coming out of the half

would save face for him
imagine getting blown out by the bengals
bengals feeling themselves right now im not saying its over but this is def an ugly game the league knows we a 1 and done team
ben has thrown exactly 17 ints in every super bowl year we are going through a start w adjustment for lombardi 7


everyone remain calm


all part of the plan
17 0 vs the bengals
cincinnati is getting away with playing a pretty dirty fucking game tonight
put mason in get a ben the rest and let him think about how shit hes been
we dont even deserve a playoff spot honestly
the defense is gassed this pathetic ass offense has really fucked them
if we dont score a td by the half then we are done for this game this game is making me sick
hello darkness my old friend
steelers letting the bengals win so the bengals get a worse pick in the draft
fucking gutless this team sucks right now they couldnt beat a high school squad to save the human race
defense gave up when they saw the offense didnt show up

cant blame them
im kinda disappointed that we cant miss the playoffs anymore
ben is done holy shit this bengals d is poor too
do yall now understand why people were challenging the validity of the 110 team
its crazy because randys called a decent game its just all on ben
if our qbs name wasnt ben roethlisberger he wouldnt be starting 513 2 yards 1 interception that gets you on the bench
ill take steelers playing down to their opponent for 200 alex
as a jet fan i cant look at trevor lawrence footage without crying
id bench ben at this point
might need rudolph to guide the sleigh tonight
you turn the ball over again give them favorable field position yet again then you want to handcuff your only productive side of the ball even more by giving them 15 yards

this game is getting turned off see you boys next week im not doing this to myself tonight
im going to jump in front of a truck
why didnt any of you fucks remind me not to go on rnfl
i live in cinci have never been so thankful for work from home coworkers would be brutal tomorrow if i had to go in
bench roethlisbuger


im sorry im lashing out
diontae johnson and benny snell have been the most productive players on offense tonight just as we all predicted
i mean at this point the number one seed is gone for sure so you might as well put rudolph in
are they going to post a single point this game or have we hit rock bottom losing 0something to the bengals smh
36 yards the offense has 36 yards offense not in one drive not one quarter but an entire half
tomlin better take some souls in the locker room at halftime
if tomlin has balls he will bench ben
dont the bengals get the ball back at the half lmao like fade me fam
short pass short pass short pass short pass sh
what the fuck am i watching right now
even if the penalties offset it still counts towards the unsportsmanlike category like the warning or whatever
well something must be done what will tomlin say after this game i wonder
thank god i live in pittsburgh so everyone feels my pain
its like we forgot how to play football
3 straight years of collapsing in december we are a well coached team
can our coaching staff act like they actually care about this game and bench ben this isnt bens team its the god damn steelers he can get his fee fees hurt and maybe start practicing during the week or something
where are the morons who would say youre a fake fan for pointing out this team had serious problems earlier in the season
has anyone tried unplugging and plugging back in our team
we finally have a great defense after 10 years and the offense starts selling and its mostly rookie contracts on defense too crazy
why does this team constantly feel the need to embarrass us 36 yards of offense against a nothingbengals team is beyond terrible
this team doesnt deserve to win the division
what are the chances of a 3 and out by the steelers i say 90
put in josh dobbs
did ben bet on the bengals or something
for the love of god just sit ben
at least with duck we had good memes
the best that can happen right now is for someone to step on bens ankle then kick his helmet right at randy fichtner sending him into a coma till march
and i was laughing at the rams yesterday
whyyy would you run out of bounds
they look like they arent even trying
you absolutely cannot convince me that ben is still an nfl qb you genuinely cannot do it
this is just embarrassing wtf is going on
this is worse than any game we played last year by a fucking mile
the checklist of what not to do in a football game are all getting checkmarked by this team tonight
ben how are you going to come off a full week of practice and against a 2 win team and put up 19 yards
maybe we just dont do the second half
praying for the best half time talk or all time
idc if we come out and win 10017 at this point this is shit a win clinches the division and i guess we just dont want it
pain
drinking champagne without the cham
can anyone come up with a moment this offense died the last game they had things going okay was the browns game then the crappy second half against the titans and then bad first half against the ravens the dallas happened and it was just done anyone know what actually happened or changed
so whats everyone doing tonight cuz i cant find a steelers game on tonight
chris berman looking like mr scrooge
ben is hitting around 20 of his 20 yard throws seriously need to start looking for a replacement
i am fairly upset
i am now on the kyle trask train
i went outside to check out saturn and jupiter at halftime have they said whether ben is back
how are we looking worse than the jets
of all the things that are problems i assure you all that if juju stopped dancing that nothing would be different
yall got any more of them qbs
turns out bell was right ben wants to win his way now we have to watch us lose his way too
bruh
even pittsburgh dad suggested we put the muppets in
lmfao if mason comes in im watching for the memes
holy shit rooney in at qb
thats what we needed to start now need the offense to react
we will never hear the end of this
alright boys 3yardrun screen pass for 2yards pass deflected at line of scrimmage i hope im wrong
chase claypool is good at stuff
fucking finally ben remembered how to pass incredible throw
well i guess at least our run game now resembles that of a below average nfl team rather than a recreational nursing home squad soyou knowsilver linings
here we fucking go
oh christ success on a screen us not ideal
rumors of his demise were greatly exaggerated
lmaoooo i hate this team so much where the fuck was that all game oh my gooooood
ben loves drama
turning point of the season
lol bengals gonna cry for a flag when they mauled ebron and hit juju in the chin when he was defenseless those fucking idiots
tomlin must of threatened to play mason
lulled them to sleep


the steelers long con


21 unanswered incoming
well that was nice i cant say im overall optimistic but that was really fucking nice
glad to see them score but where was this in the first half we cant be trying to dig ourselves out of a hole every game we arent going to have continued success if we do that
im afraid to get excited
tomlin truly got super powers tonight who tf knows what he told everyone in the locker room but now were looking good
get that ball into claypools hands more please
ben has to start making that throw routine week in and week out again
ok so we do know how to play football ok good just checking
was that ben in the steelers fans at home
lol so what was ben just sandbagging in the first half or
the one thing missing tonight a defensive turnover
ray ray stay away from those bouncers
sutton is the best db weve drafted in recent memory
wow i thought he was catching that for sure
my friend caleb hadnt watched any steelers games all year but he has watched the last 2 plus the first half of this one he turned it off at my request and we instantly scored and got a stop im sorry about him guys ill try and control him better
god only knows what mike tomlin said at halftime but i wouldnt have wanted to be there for it
tomlin appears to be a great motivator questionable coach great motivator
what did tomlin say in that locker room
dj is back and im 100 here for it take over young sir
these are different people right
not sure what tomlin said at halftime but i am glad he said it finally looking nonlethargic
benjamin cornelius snell
1st and goal we might as well kick a field goal
stalling on a fg sucks but i sort of like the rhythm we are getting into gotta keep it going though all gas here force a turnover and we can turn the tide of this game
if we come back i hope juju pisses on their logo and ill go piss on mark maddens house
randy couldnt see the run plays at the bottom of his sheet until he pulled his mask down for his halftime snack
is this jujus dancing fault too
damn that wouldve been a great call on 2nd and 1
its crazy how we went from one of the best olines to one of the worst olines
its probably just a cramp right right
can we stop running out of the shotgun all the time
minkah plz a pic 6
our short yardage running game is embarrassing
just fucking go under center if were running on 3rd and 1 oh my god
we literally have no more linebackers what the fuck
at this rate were gonna field the first linebackerless defense
this ryan kid is the fucking terminator good lord that replay hurt my spine
any lbs in here we need volunteers
i think the bengals still want this more than we do
he didnt cross the line
so how do we plan on stopping the colts run game next week without linebackers
reminder that this sport is played at a professional level when you play abysmally like our offense has any competent team will see that and make adjustments the bengals are doing just that if fichtner isnt fired by the end of the season i question this teams future
throw a pic finley i know you want to
they are going just keep running the steelers have no lbs to plug holes
steelers still win
but anyone else so drunk they can barely watch the game
this game is rough
pathetic fucking performance against a 2101 team with a fucking backup qb
man they are running all over us really showing how much we are missing our ilbs
getting embarrassed by finley lmao we blow
the worst part is that we need to score fast which doesnt give the defense time to rest
if finleys doing this im scared of mahomes
its not like theyve called the option 4 times already
we make the fuckin biggest pieces of shit look good
bye bye randy
ok im officially concerned
lamar finley
shoutout to those of us who turned off the game and are playing video games

woo salvaged a monday night
maybe we were the muppets all along
everybody knew the bengals werent going to throw it except for the steelers
ryan lamar jackson finley
9 play 80 yard drive from ryan finley nice job number 1 defense
colbert needs to have a long hard talk with roethlisberger hes talking about playing two more years please with guys like dupree and juju in contract years and watt next year we are gonna have to start making some really tough decisions a 40 year old qb eating up cap space just doesnt make sense
bengals now should have had 4 interceptions by my count all in their handsall dropped
just about turned this off if that was picked
we have always had the slowest hurry up offense ever
stop wasting so much time holy shit
the o line gets bullied every single game
yep dpi
d needs a 3 and out
this drive has no urgency
defense had plenty of rest they need to force a stop the on them if they dont
fuck it im playin renegade rn on my phone
alright defense one more drive one more 3 and out lets go boys
this jig is up the news is out
theyve finally found me
the renegade who had it made
retrieved for a bounty
never more to go astray
this will be the end today of the wanted man
we need a stop defense time to show the fuck up
can you believe the time of possession is basically the same imagine if this team wasnt so fucking sloppy with three turnovers this wouldnt even be a game
i hate to say it but finley is super slick with hiding that ball its tricking my eyes every time
helluva play by minkah
75 yards to tie it yikes
this offense man it makes me so sad
why not just play for the first down come on
wtf why not go for the sticks
and thats game unreal
the defender ran right into clay but ok i guess
were a buncha frauds
what garbage playcall what happened to moving the chains
you have two minutes the two minute warning and a time out on third and ten and you throw an absolute prayer lol
pulling his shoulder back before we can even see the ball yeah still not dpi for me dog

christ that was bad
goodnight everybody
gn guys they disappoint us once again
my grandma has a quicker kick step than av
holy shit ben is awful
o line 2 old qb 2 old
dont care if we went 110 we dont deserve a playoff appearance after these past 3 games
villanueva smh
this game was painful to watch and it was against the bengals the playoffs will be savage
im not one to think this stuff but i would be lying to myself if i didnt think this game was literally thrown all this shit looks like they purposefully lost on purposethat pass was unbelievable
16 seconds big deal remember when they wasted those seconds before halftime yeah thats why that matters
contrary to what this idiot announcer says not going for a field goal makes no sense field goal makes it a two score game with 16 seconds left no field goal lets them possibly have the chance to tie it
so against indy were going to get murdered or beat them by 30
dont worry guys a few more practices off and ben will be good as new
imagine fucking chiming in about this should have been a flag but having shut up all fucking game about the dirty plays of the bengals all game dude fuck off announcers
this thread is funny because theres like 5 people who are clearly on a shitty stream and need a new isp
if yall think we winning a playoff game with this fucking offense youre crazy
holy fuck ben has been awful
this defense does not deserve this offense
i wonder what it feels like to be tj watt like the literal only person to give a shit
randy needs to goooooo randy needs to gooooo randy is a fucking idiot and he has to goooooo
ben somehow looks worse than brees did and brees broke 11 fucking ribs sit him until the playoffs lose in the wild card game move on next year pray the defense can still be elite
to the untrained eye it looks like this team is falling apart


what you are seeing is strategery playoff teams watching game film have nothing on us
has any team ever started 110 and lost the division
if we lose this game mfs better be getting fired and benched fucking unacceptable
where is the fucking flag jesus fucking christ these refs are fucked
how was that not a flag contact early helmet to helmet jeeze
straight to the defender holy fuck every game since that delayed ravens game just keeps getting worse
you have to bench him right he has negative passing yards and 2 turnovers it would literally be better to not have a qb at all at this point
i appreciate everything ben has done for us but he looks cooked i dont doubt he is hurt but i just dont think he is the guy anymore how can they justify his contract in 2021
controversial opinion we should maybe consider firing randy fichther
even with his mask on you can see tomlins deer in headlights expression
its typically just randys retarded play calling that hinders the offense tonight were seeing how bad it is when ben is playing like shit too
i was one of those fans who wanted them to lose a game because they needed a reality check and needed to make some adjustments but uh this isnt what i meant
shutout in the first half by a 2 win team 14 point favorite steelers are a joke
cameron hayward looks like hes going to murder rothlisberger
i need to know something from the calm down folks of the sub when can we panic
alright im back to complaining about not converting in the red zone big step up from where we were
geez can that guy tuck those teeth back or not
these commentators are soooo garbage the refs barely hand out free plays this season theres no special treatment for it
how was that not pi and why did claypool start jogging
guys pi or not ben should not be throwing that ball into quadruple coverage fucking inexcusable
steelers crawl into the playoffs with an injured team and get obliterated in the first round just as we expected
coming in here to clown us is pointless we are already despondent
why are you clowns calling for juju to be shot and murdered calm your tits would be shocked to not see him a get resigned b play well for the next 3 weeks and next season
that was blatant dpi
anyone blaming juju for that is insane

that fumble was all on ben
900 iq coaching move would be to put in dobbs for the final three games he has such a different style from ben that people will start gameplanning for that instead and then once the playoffs roll around tell everyone youre sticking with dobbs and then boom ben comes in at the last second and can do all of the 5 yard passes to his hearts content and no one planned for it cause they were getting ready for dobbs instead
holy shit the locker room is mad

source jujus new tiktok video
am i biased as fuck or did chase claypool just get absolutely mugged with no flag
im starting to believe those worst 110 team ever people
is helmet to helmet not a thing anymore
cant even get mad at juju for that short passes like that set receivers up to get their heads knocked off
does ben hate chase
ben is actively avoiding claypool at this point
these lame tmz announcers cant get enough of mentioning juju on the logo can they just clone romo already
you know its bad when you wish ab was on the sideline throwing a temper tantrum

just show some damn passion and desire to be better
someone turn on the duck signal
bens work ethic is contagious and it shows on the offense
i think today i made the swap we dont need ol in round 1 we need a qb
wheres duck hodges me again unironically

holy fuckin shit this is so bad lmao
i would take mitch trubisky right now over ben right now

id take literally any other starting qb rn even darnold thats how bad ben currently looks
in my 25 years as a steelers fan i have never turned off a steelers game this makes two weeks in a row because this offense is literally worse than last years ridiculous
if you dont love this then you dont love mike tomlin football
we should be up by 10 how the hell do you give up 3 turnovers
all i see is juju this and juju that but no one gonna talk about how ben cant make the throws he used to make anymore
did did ben just throw into quadruple coverage what the fuck
retire


e


t


i


r


e
this game might be squarely on ben he was beyond god awful
you know i love this team i will always love this team no matter what its unfortunate that our descent began at the end of the season i look forward to next game but right now im hurt i dont understand this team i dont understand the play calling i dont understand the decision making what is it going to take i know everyone says fire everyone cut juju cut conner bench ben etc but honestly what is it going to take for us to have a great offense and a great defense what is it going to take to play a full football game at a high level what is it going to take to be a complete football team right now i honestly dont know ill see yall next week here we go
i seriously think ben is just straight up tired the man is 38 with a reconstructed arm and playing football for the 11th week straight and had a lot of short and weird weeks like the whole raven week think we need to start mason next weekend and just give ben 7 days off cuz whatever state he is in right now will not any playoff games
in the stadium cold as fuck watching our boys warm up

couple questions for yinz

who ride
who dey
when will commentators learn that steelers fans dont travel well theyre already there
thats our steeler offense smh ik its first possession but 3 n out
and a nasty injury to kick off this game
holy shit hes dead
damn tj is standing right there
holy shit knocked out cold hopefully thats all it is
jesus no chance that wouldve been enough anyway throw to the sticks ffs
lmao same old offense unreal
welp shit i know we dont play derek watt much but damn he got knocked the fuck out hope he is okay that hit didnt even look like his fault
the bengals most talented player today tee higgins


3rd string dogshit qb grandpa backup rb


and you just know its gonna be close
jeez i hope he is ok
that was a brutal hit i hope hes all right
really hope derek is okay that shit wasnt good
i cant even imagine whats going through tjs mind of course you are gutted to see a teammate get hurt but when its a teammate brother its gotta be so much more difficult hopefully its not too serious
im already crying fuck derek
bro not again we dont need more players getting hurt against the bengals
fuck off whole foods how is watt
guess that crushes our hopes of seeing more of derek watt on the offense today
jesus camera men are like hey here announcers this is tj watt the brother of the guy who just got knocked out you should talk about him

announcers yeah this is a physical game that guy took a hit
immediate fencing response ugh
weve played against so many qbs this season that ive never heard of before
great stop tj
tj watt picking up the slack
ray ray mcdonaldmy man
i hope we can make it past our own 25 this drive
i mean i know bobby hart sucks but at least he plays tackle how the fuck you going to try to run at tj watt with a te lead blocking lol
tj watt
dpoy
they are really going to jam the commercials into this game
alright we got our routine shitshow of an opening drive out of the way can we do something or do we gotta wait another quarter or two

juju hands of glue
i like how were running play action more
if only ben could throw
this defense of ours has to be getting pretty annoyed with our offense
this offense is a fucking joke
lol i shit on randy a lot but these playactions are wide open ben is playing like absolute shit right now
man we got to see an incredible offense with the killer bs wasted by absolutely garbage defense

i really dont want to see our incredible defense wasted by an incompetent offense
matthew staffiord next year
excellent coverage by nelson
whats the record for most combined 3 and outs in a game thats 4 in 6 minutes
guess we need to pray for a defensive score tonight
this first quarter is giving me flashbacks from last week
im just hoping for a first down on this drive
has there been any first downs
this is looking exactly like the bills game so far we should be up big at half but the offense cant move the chains
the offense needs to help our defense
maybe offense will show up this drive lol
odd i thought big 10 football was done for the year
offense better get it together on this drive
can we just have the defense play offense
lmfao put the muppets in
ok now im panicking
lmao and pouncey is in the pro bowl too ffs
hes not used to being under centet
im so glad we get to lose bud dupree next season to keep a qb who refused to take a pay cut yet claims he wants to win with a qb of 10000

my heart is so filled with joy and gladness
if we lose to this 2101 bengals team i refuse to watch another steelers game all season
pick 6 would be lovely
damn our offense just gets worse every drive
oh wow i guess were just a terrible team all of a sudden
yo he was short
ah yes lull them into a false sense of security big brain moves
as soon as ben says hes coming back next year too man this is sad
bros if we couldnt advance in postseasons with ben brown bell we certainly arent advancing with this offensive core lol
eh fitzpatrick making a solid tackle there
nice great sack
honestly just waiting for the day most of you realize that finctner sucks at his job and needs to go
how much does our defense have to do to help our shitty offense
dpoy right there
good boy watt
thank god i chose to buy a watt jersey instead of a juju jersey lets hope he stays
ryan findley out here trying to save our team
i am starting to despise our offense
can tj play hc oc and qb
highsmith is going to be special
d going to be exhausted in the 1st quarter
we are trailing the bengals on their 3rd string quarterback
man what the fuck
a negative 3 yard pass so refreshing
this offense lol av cant block one guy
omg you cant make this play calling up
thats a good play if al maintains the block
its good to throw behind the line
ben looks 100 yrs old
this is ugly
why is chase claypool not on the field and why does our oc not know that the field extends more than 5 yds past the line of scrimmage short passes and runs on 90 of plays regardless of the situation
there has been one first down in this game and it came by an inch or so on a generous spot if i wasnt rooting for a team in this game i might puke
i would like to see mapletron out there more
how did the offense regress so much
where did our 30 ptgame offense go and who the fuck are these imposters
seriously if ben cant get under center so they can try and run the ball its time to figure some shit out
the play calling doesnt seem like an issue tonight theyve tried different looks ben just looks washed
how is our offense somehow actually worse than it was last year
berry has punted well tonight so theres that
questionable j berry leg fatigue
good lord if burrow was healthy they would by up 14
dude i hate to say this ben actually has to be benched
thats the 3 should have been interception in 3 drives fichtner sucks but hes not out there making ben throw those balls
im not high enough for this
i want someone not tomlin fired right now
good old reliable minkah
draft a fucking qb and olineman fucksake
when ryan finley outplays big ben
defence is literally gonna die tonight they have 0 rest
omg is the fucking bungals going to light our asses up tonight wtf
boyd probably has a concussion
this feels so much like 2018 except we are already guaranteed a playoff spot
just get out of this game with a w doesnt matter how ugly then rest everyone who needs to be next two weeks
were gonna lose to the dolphins at worst and ravens at best

ugliest news is browns game week 17 might be prime time at this rate twas fun ladies and germs
i think i might go jerk off and watch a movie instead of watching this shitshow
i cant really tell if the line or the wrs or the qb is the problem pathetic that they cannot even get a 1st down against the bungles
our poor defense is going to get so tired

not quitting on the team but man this beginning to the game is outright disgusting just bad to watch man
if yall havnt been here for jaguars vs pittsburgh and saw ben throw 3 picks i understand 100 why you think he will be benched im already used to this lol ben will be out there until this games over
as bad as ben is i think rudolph is worse is duck busy
does finley ever stop smiling
i want duck not because hell do any better but because i want memes
go for it why not our offense sucks
steelers are stanking up the joint the last 3 weeks this offense is duck hodges bad and he doesnt deserve that lol i know
time to block colin cowherd on all platforms that dude is gonna get a hard on shitting on us for the next few days
bens passes have hit more bengal hands than steelers
how have they not had an int yet
and the steelers will have great field position for their next punt attempt
so basically the offenses contribution is just to give the defense a few minutes to catch their breath otherwise theres no point in them even coming on the field
ben sucks right now
please retire
good god this offense is horrible to watch
theyre seriously gonna keep doing the same shit jesus fucking christ has this team become the old browns or what
bench bens bum ass he just got juju killed
lmao wtf do we do at this point cant hit throws and cant run the ball i literally dont know how they can fix this
what the hell are they doing
3rd and 7 running a route at the los kill me now pls
its 2am where i am and im not enjoying this
5 punts in one quarter at what point do you keep doing the same thing at what point do you leave ben in he sucks
no one saw the short pass coming
why the fuck are we running plays short of the sticks in that situation
soubds like im getting drunk again tonight ladies gents
can randy call something other than a screen or a crossing route
why cant we throw a freakin pass beyond the line of scrimmage
the defense needs to get in the face of the offense cause they arent showing any energy they just dont care this offense is much worse than the jets who are 113 pathetic considering one should have energy
worst offense in the nfl ben is done bench him immediately claypool wide open unreal fuck
run the ball
no helmet to helmet on a defenseless receiver ok
i feel like such a dumbfuck for starting ben in fantasy no championship for me
beating the chiefs let alone a playoff team with this o

nah
its still early but this is not good the team on the field fucking sucks and i cant see how theyre going to turn it around
just put rudolph in ffs
you cant overstate how bad this offense is it is worse than the duck and rudolph offense dont know how thats possible but it is ben is going out with a whimper he should just retire after the one and done
ben really just tried to kill juju
bens not going thru any progressions just first read pass
i am straight up not having a good time
this is the most pathetic excuse for an offense that ive ever seen we dont deserve our record
for everyone yelling about fichtner and yes he has serious issues 7 is also an issue claypool comes wide the fuck open but roethlisberger is already committed to the same drag 8 yards short of the sticks
ben is washed lol juju double covered on a crosser at the line of scrimmage lets throw him the ball he isnt even going through any reads
this season is over

playoffs will be a total embarrassment


editcheck my past postsi have never been debbie downer on this team but something is really broke in this offense and it wont get fixed this year
big ben looks frustrated right now he is missing opening receivers chase claypool was the better option on that route and he decides to dink and dunk it to juju who ends up getting smacked
this offense is horrific looks worse than some of the games with duck as qb last year
bens actually broken holy shit
lol comments crying about a helmet to helmet how about saying that claypool was wide fucking open
look i live ben been the only qb ive know my entire pittsburgh steelers qb but holy fuck its like watching my own dog slowly die he looks hurt man bench him please he needs a break
ben is just not seeing the field well hes going with his first read no matter what he needs to wake up
poor defense
fumble as well as helmet to helmet
how have we not fired randy yet lol 5 straight possessions without a 1st down
after our one game exit from the playoffs someone out there is going to write one hell of a story about the collapse of this team from 11 wins in a row to whatever the hell this is
the offense looks completely and utterly one dimensional right now
helmet to chin hello
helmet to helmet
how is that not helmet to helmet
im sorry but ben needs to just retire at this point and fichtner sarrett gotta go id rather fly another sufferable season with a backup because there is no excuse for the product displayed right now
removed
stop being so toxic guys the team is clearly fine s
god we fucking suck so bad on offense
this team is embarrassing rn
two total offensive yards in the first quarter
just got a text from an uncle

im bleeding from my eyes

couldnt say it any better
maybe the worst steelers quarter ive ever seen truly
ok now that our bad football is out of the way we are about to dominate right right
offense gonna put their angry faces on and go 3 out next drive
ok steelers have no chance in the playoffs playing like this
the ben regression is happening before our eyes he stared the season hot but these last 4 weeks he cant complete a pass more than 20 yards and the offense cant compensate defenses dont have to respect a deep ball or a fake run so just drop back and wait for a gift
if you want an example of how predictable our offense is look at that last play that safety left chase claypool wide open past the sticks to chase a short route on 3rd 7 thats an embarrassing level of predictability
its a tough look to dance on the other teams logo and play for an offense like this do that shit in kc in a month if they even get that far and they will put up a 70 burger on us
steelers should punt on first down for the rest of the game
i knew things were looking bad but shit man this is worse than i thought
why the fuck doesnt this offense get claypool more involved he is the best receiving vertical threat on this team and a matchup nightmare 1 on 1 there is simply no excuse for the 2 yard bullshit here
heaven just got better on defense i love it
im just mad the announcer are blatantly ignoring the helmet to chin cant even comment and say it was a good hit
would love to see tomlin tear into the offense on the sideline the way he does the defense
i get it ben just wants to test the limits of our defense and see how good they are genius
man yall have a good defense but if the defense stays on the field constantly it aint gonna look pretty
i already want to stop watching this game this is so fucking sad
i feel like calling this team a complete fucking embarrassment might be an insult to complete fucking embarrassments
we are legit being dominated
we look so embarrasssing holy fuck i cant watch
steelers about to be down 100 in a game they were favored by 145
two turnovers 10 point deficit shocker
were gonna lose the division i feel it coming
this isnt on the defense
panicking
holy shit we are the most shit 112 team
hard to blame the defense for that one short field yet again and almost no rest the entire game so far this offense is anemic and its going to ruin our season if we dont change up the play calling
exactly what changes were made from last week im dying to know
this is one of those even if we win this game we still lose situations this is absolutely terrible no 1st downs and 2 turnovers im not sure i see a path to this team winning a playoff game what happened to this offense
ben has 5 yards 5 yards
at what point does tomlin have to pull ben
at this point weve struggled on offense for at least 4 straight games i dont think theres gonna be any turning it around
this team has literally fell off of a cliff they look awful against every team they play now i honestly didnt think that they would win the super bowl this season but i wasnt expecting them to just fall apart with a couple of games left in the season
i seriously cant believe what i am seeing from this offense for how many weeks in a row now the scary part is that i dont know if this is fixable with the current staff and roster
ben after first two losses of the season maybe im just not any good
ben were not emotionally tough
ben im coming back next year
anyone notice anything
at the rate this offense is going forget about a touchdown theyll never even get in range for a field goal
stwelers offense has punted the ball 65 mes that is the second most tops is the jets with 70 no doubt theyll be tops by the end of the game how fichter still is oc is beyond me
holy shit positive 1st down run
you know im no football coach but maybe our run game would open up a bit if we didnt run every play out of the gun and let our linemen get down in a three point stance and yknow run block instead of starting from the pass block position
ive seen nursing home residents that can run better than this team
what no flag what
this is a joke wtf lol
that has to be an early hit but regardless terrible decisions by ben
this is just a constant shit show right now hope ebron is all right my blood pressure and anxiety is too fucking high
is ben trying to kill his teammates
ben what the fuck
where is the dpi
i understand why the saints are still angry
ben loving these suicide passes
claypool keeps running further than ben can throw it
does ben not remember the plays or just making ever wrong read multiple plays missing guys wide open
has ben completed a single pass
so were just not calling penalties tonight apparently
does ben hate claypool or something
not really a fair freeze frame for the post route considering ben is already looking and in the throwing motion for ebron safety is already breaking that way

only way that works is if ben pumps and then goes claypool
i thought the defender got there early on that one
hope the defense starts smacking people you cannot let them tee off on our players like this

if the refs wont call flags then we need to start playing more physical
i just dont understand how our offense has regressed so far
they are still playing like a 210 team its just that were so bad we make them look good
roethlisberger looked pissed on the sideline after that last possession and looks frustrated on this one not for nothing its easy to be a good teammate and talk about how much youve changed when you are 110 i am terrified that diva roethlisberger might rear his ugly head at the worst possible time as we gear up for a playoff run
draw plays are now 1 for 6793
defense is at least getting some rest
he caught one he caught one
claypool pissed wide open multiple times yet he gets it on a sweep for a loss
claypool getting frustrated and i dont blame him
ok ben to the bench for a little while
yooo this is funny at this point
im so far gone i cackled when it got intercepted fuck this lol
johnny manzel needs to come down to teach ben a little something about sitting on a bench

okay ill bite we need to bench ben
what an epic collapse
this aint fucking it chief
yeah it pains me to say but rudolph in
fuck roethlisberger hes being shown up by finley of the fucking bungles
honestlybench ben
finctner shouldnt be allowed on the plane ride back
bench his ass
this team is going 115
i want dobbs now
sit ben let rudolph at least try to get us a christmas miracle
really looks like ben should hang them up play with mason for a year to have a shit record and hope they can get a decent pick for 2022
just bench him
its only fucking fair to the laws of football you bench him
bench ben
we look like a fucking disgrace
i mean that high step was technically a taunt just sayin
yo they need to bench ben have a doctor look at his eyes this is the worst ive ever seen him throw the ball

oh yeah and of course they flag us cuz they can only see a penalty when its in bright yellow
kyle trask or mac jones which one yall like more
i think its time to bring rudolph in
we might get shutout by one of the worst teams in the nfl
513 2 yards enough said
ben is done dude isnt looking off his receivers his lack of discipline caught up to him this year
we fucking suck
benching rudolph provided a spark and a win against the bengals last year gotta wonder if its an option here but for mason rudolph has his issues but i feel like he could outdo 2 passing yards
thank god we didnt play the jets this year
well gg
we literally forgot how to play
no fucking heart
i expect routine plays to be made routinely
game over
absolute collapse
finleys teeth are so fucking huge with his tiny face
we have officially imploded
wow we fucking suck
imagine getting gashed by a fucking 2 win team at least washington is actually a decent team the bengals are straight trash and we find a way to play worse than them this isnt playing down to your opponent this is piss poor playcalling fronted by an anemic run game and a dumbass for a qb this game is fucking over already fuck this entire team they didnt deserve 11 wins fuck them all
this is embarrassing
please do not put ben back in he sucks so bad
brb going to drink some bleach
ive never seen a team flame out like this 11n0
i blame that td on ben too
wheres randel el
thank god joey b is not playing or this would be even worse
can we trade our playoff spot to jacksonville for the 1st round pick
i know we already clinched the playoffs but guys can you stop embarrassing me
how did we win 11 lol i guess ive been drinking too much this season
its 230am man this isnt worth it gnight all
sad that this is how the ben era appears to be wrapping up
bens eyes look glazed no spark no anger he needs to sit
at least only just over 3 weeks until hockey szn
if ben turns the ball over one more and continues to fall apart steelers need to put in dobbs or rudolph to spark something because this offense is brutal
i cannot fucking wait to lose the division after starting 110 and lose in the first round in epic fashion hot fucking garbage
if we are getting blown out by the 210 bungals with a 3rd string qb we will lose by 50 in the playoffs at least
i think ben literally only looks at his first read and then throws it no matter what he is throwing arrogantly thinking he can hit impossible holes
we wouldnt beat the jets right now not a single power ranking should have us in the top 20 tomorrow

we are flat out bad
whats terry bradshaw doing these days
ben is costing us this game
we collapsing harder than a super massive star at the end of its life rn
can we opt out of the playoffs
drew brees played better with all his ribs broken
this is so bad i cant even be mad at it im just laughing
rudolph hope your arm is right cause ben really sucks tonight
ok but seriously how were we 110
remember when the steelers were the team that stood out and usually won most prime time games
we are getting brigaded hard its hysterical theres no one more self deprecating than pittsburgh fans
jesus fuck this is embarrassing have to stay away from rnfl although im sure all 31 teams gonna have fans brigading us
someone needs to get al pacino into this fucking teams locker room at halftime
well dj is catching it

thats a good thing right
its like fitchner thinks bens arm is done so early in the season he makes us a short passing team but thats all he called we did well because we have a great defense however now the defenses have adapted basically treating us like a team that only has a running game and has crushed us fitchner has called deep passes the last few but ben has pretty much just proven fitchner right
one night eight hundred years ago a peasant farmer looked up into the sky pointed out the especially bright star to his young son and said boy the next time that happens the steelers will be losing to the freaking bengals
i thought unsportsmanlike supersedes
isnt a dead ball foul enforced and not offset
its too easy for the bengals they need a defensive touchdown to get some momentum
fs in chat for this l they will need to come out a completely different team in the 2nd half to turn this around
this team is falling apart
this is what you get with the onedimension offense
alexander is a fucking piece of shit
damn after seeing the score im glad im stuck at work
fuck fuck fuck
can tomlin light a fucking fire under this team i often see head coaches lighting fires under players asses to get them going and all tomlin is fucking doing is just standing there like he doesnt wanna be there any longer
its going to be weird as fuck watching the steelers without big ben hes been our qb for basically the whole time ive been a fan of the steelers but i honestly think its time
this is our opportunity to clinch the division and what do we do shit the bed

browns play the jets and we play the colts unless we somehow beat the colts i dont see us winning the division
does sfincter know that claypool is on our team
no timeout here living in our fears
oh boy we get the ball again
do we even try to get points in the last minute
ben needs to be benched his head is not in the game
were making late season meltdowns an annual thing now
rudolph with your nose so bright
for fucks sake bench ben for the second half
if they just stay in the locker room and dont come out for the second half i wouldnt even be mad
ben just do that thing where you fake an injury and this all can be over
bens entered the oh there is pressure ill just drop the ball
1st round exit
rudolph will come in and sling it to claypool
berry looks good
wtf would you stop the clock

heyward looks so pissed dude
if i didnt have work in the morning id be getting drunk rn
where are the fundamentals
lmao wtf is going on
i cant listen to miss 5packs a day and jabba the dunce for 30 mins see ya in the 3rd
as far as i can remember that was the worst first half ive experienced in about 20 years as a fan
the good news is this offense is going to look pretty different next season
not sure how we can say randy is the issue ben is missing throws and turning it over
well at least we qualified for the playoffs

im in full on cope mode bros
really shouldnt be watching this game at work i think i developed a fucking twitch
is ben playing hurt

defense looks so different without dupree as well
being down isnt that bad but 17 points feels like more than we are capable of in a whole game let alone a half
boswell should just start kicking passes to everyone
welp ben is in sweats
lets get a turnover and then proceed to kick their striped asses
our poor defense they play great but are constantly being put in bad situations by the offense
can we put these muppets in on offense cant be worse
oh god radio says rudolph warming up m
ben is on the sidelines wearing sweatpants holy fuck
i think something happened to bens elbow game 12 i wish i could pull the video it was on a sack plus his knee hes done at this point put in mason and see what he could do
phil rivers is going to you know what us in the you know where next week
thank god finley sucks
this is game is still winnable but we have to score a td on this possession and hope the defense holds up and not allow any more scores its daunting but doable here we go
ben looks like he couldnt care less i dont get it
can the steelers score 20 straight and have the d hold the bengals scoreless in the second half
chase save us
almost like claypool is a playmaker
here comes the comeback
where my negative people at i hope yall saved my comments 2117 end of 3rd
straight to the superbowl
lets go mason
alright where the fuck was that
good now do it again
the pain killers are kicking in
im crying i saw a glimpse of fall steelers football and i missed it so much
what just happened
theres the top talent i know good lord
fuck yes need another one of those
bengals gonna bungle the one thing giving me hope
thank fuck
props to ben on that throw
very happy to be corrected ben
if this offense gets its shit together its stairway to seven dont lose faith boys this team still has the potential for a deep playoff run
im smelling an int coming here im thinking nelson or minkah
lets fucking go
sutton has been balling out lately love to see it
to be a fly on the wall in the locker room during halftime
what in the hell went on in the locker room
get the fuckin first down jfc
jesus christ why cant dionte just run straight up field that was an easy first down but no i gotta juke back and fourth for no yards
diontae i like the confidence but dont do that
wtf am i watching lol
wtf did they inject into bens arm hes fucking ripping em
hessaneaur benched and clapping his teammates on the sidelines love it
now dont overreact people the steelers arent saved but we should definitely be happy
ben called a run audible
if claypool made that i would flip shit
what fucking team is this
gotta catch up so we have a nail biter at the end of course
alright lets get that turnover boys
what is up with these idiot announcers
defense forcing a turnover i can feel it
they rly just jinxed boswell huh
should have handed it to snell 1st and 2nd there but ill take the 3 points 1 touchdown game
minkah time right now
i decided to play a couple games of fortnite with my son and come back to this comeback
take the points and get back on defense lets goooooo
did we actually make adjustments at the half seems like a different offense out there
please all i want is a 1pm sunday game please its all i ask for
does anyone else think this commentator sounds like steve kerr
ray ray 90 yards to the house incoming
tf these commentators on about get back to forcing turnovers as if its a gameplan smh
run it there mannnn come on
he good cramp
looked like johnson tweaked his ankle no just a really weird flick of his foot there
why the fuck do we keep running up the gut
give dj some pickle juice and put em back out there
this is why you run on 2nd and 1
that fucking dumbass fake end around has not worked for weeks and weeks
benny snell cant read holea
2nd and 1 and you dont fucking get a first down lmao we are fucking garbage
chuks is getting mauled out there man has to learn how to block
man decastro just goes nowhere anymore just stalemates at best
ik you have been doing great defense but we are going to need a turnover
guys we cant go back to being toxic again positivity now
hopefully diontae just needs a little ice and is good to continue
so that 3rdand1 play was designed 100 dependent on assuming the mlb would just indiscriminately and completely fall for chasing the wr in motion

i hate fichtner
oh no all our players are being injured again
fuck another injury
damn allen hope your shoulders okay man
lbs cursed
oh fuccckkkk off announcers this should be rtp but no mention of h to h on juju
allen said nvm im fine
so allen is okay thats good
bernard sucksstuff the fkn run
gosh if only they still had burfict wed have so many free yards from penalties
if they score here we lose
we are incapable of playing a complete game
jesus christ butler they literally cant throw the ball and you going full prevent
fucking embarrassing
we deserve this
skinny toothy fucker embarassing us
literally the exact same play as the 3rd down conversion
so much for the comeback
thats game
lol getting punked by the bungles effing 3rd string shitty ass quarterback have a little pride out there
yeah we dont deserve to win
yo highsmith did it ever occur to you that finley could keep it
you fucking idiots you knew that shit was gonna happen wtf this is elementary shit they ran the zone read earlier wtf stupid fucking idiots
me sighing fuck
in a way i want whatever it takes to fire fichtner to happen
making this scrub look like god damn tom brady
overly dependent on turnovers
wish that buck toothed kid would get cracked props to him tho
i get all the finger pointing at the offense but this defense has dropped the ball against a third string qb with almost no ol
it is 2020 and we still cant cover the read option kill me

tank for lawrence
we went out there and played one quarter

thats all this team had in them

115 is still 2 more wins than i predicted so theres that cant be too mad
its bad when our offense is trash but when they score we worry about our defense now since theyre getting shredded by ryan finley lmfao what a joke of a team
never seen resting shit eating grin face like the gob on this finley dweeb
seriously whats with pittsburgh teams letting no name players torch them
this goes back to that 3rd and 1 and we cant gain a yard
that was humiliating
finley the kinda guy that would be smiling after being told his whole family just died
is this what having an oc and a slight mobile qb looks like
we should probay take some notes
i thought muppet night football was going to be the only joke tonight
im checking out this seasons over lol good run but its time to replace the quarterback in the draft and move on fichner can fuck off too
ben is washed steelers need to plan on trading up for a young qb in the draft
well that could do it i dont get this team at all im just completely stumped at this point are we good are we close wtf is this defense appears elite but cant stop the run thats the weirdest combo ever
is there a reason were not blitzing the worst quarterback weve faced so far
lol steelers responsible for turning the bengals franchise around
is that seriously the first two plays they call and after going down by two touchdowns and the fourth quarter
announcers sure think this thing is over
were down 2 tds and were running the ball in the 4th this is the time to throw you fucking moron coaching staff
need a quick td so we just run the ball
if we dont score a td on this drive then its worry time
i wonder of its hard to be motivated already going to the playoffs and second place doesnt even give you a bye week
fitchtner isnt even reading the play book thats just an ihop menu
if this is the super bowl for the bengals then the bengals are a sad ass franchise
just give us a td right here to claypool please
snell is the only one pushing forward and not running out of bounds
what am i even watching
thank god the bengals secondary has been watching our wr game film
i hate how much time we are wasting here we need to score fast
lose this game and the browns will win the division
how predictable are we gonna continue to be
fichtner is sooooo fucking bad
we are so bad
are we allowed to do that on the goal line
wtf we just ran for a yard
i woulda went for 2 but im pretty stupid
so now our defense needs an immediate 3 and out
this team gives me a heart attack every week but this is another level
that pat was damn close
pick 6 incoming u heard it hear first
need the defensive to hold them to 3 and out so we can drink and dunk our way to overtime
get one turnover out of this third stringer just one
turnover time
d needs to wake up
oh thank god the refs threw that pi i coulda easily have seen other refs not calling it
you can expect them to keep the ball on the ground to keep the clock rolling finley will try to run too they know they can get us with that
oh mama ive been years on the lam
and had a high price on my head
lawman said get him dead or alive
now its for sure hell see me dead
all i want for christmas is for finley to throw a pick 6
fucking d line is getting destroyed
this little shit is getting like 5 extra yards after first contact
so no timeout
ol grinnin finley
why cant our offensive line run block like that
stop here and theres a chance allow the 1st down and thats virtually it i think
minkah
huge play
yes
minkah baby
minkah
come on ben redemption drive
if we score please just tie it no faith going for 2

ok ben time to lock it up and tie this shit
nothing even close at this point

try for the deep pi
41 lets throw it to him
needed a dime and a dime was not to be
quadruple coverage
3rd and 10 bomb it and now you have 4th and 10 wow
lol that drive took 30 seconds
i think were gonna drop to the 3rd seed now right
cant get the flacco special every time
nah we shouldnt try to actually get a first down with two minutes and time out left we should try for td on one play
looked like they got to claypool early
just an unbelievably stupid decision with plenty of time on the clock couldve done short passes and go out of bounds nope lets just yeet the ball into doubletriple coverage
im gonna be tired af tomorrow at 5am
how is it this far into the season and you still dont know you cant challenge pis anymore
quadruple coverage 3rd and 10 last chance to just get to ot against the 2 win bengals quadruple coverage we have a timeout and a two minute warning and we just fart it away quadruple coverage
tomlin cooking up a 200 iq throw into quintuple coverage for fourth down
just a downright terrible throw
retire ben
i cant even
welp ben has a lot he has to answer for this he definitely cost us this game and im not sure where we go from here but if we keep riding this ship we are going to fucking drown
says alot about this team see yall next season these fucks arent going anywhere
hate the play calling on that final series
lmao wtf is this team
goodbye everyone see you all in therapy
jesus the brigading in here
fuck you randy spinchter
figures the refs would nail the door shut but fuck it is our fault for being in this position god this fucking team pathetic
setting us up to lose to the browns and lose the afc north all in 1 night i hate everything
how fuckin hollow does bens 60k feel right now
ive seen too many underthrown deep balls by ben to believe otherwise than that his arm strength is going south
did claypool fuck bens wife all he does it catch tds and he doesnt even get targeted now
making a play you mean tackling a man before the ball was there
ben needs to retire no team will have success in the playoffs when ur qb cant accurately throw a ball 10 yards
rams fan here i feel your pain steelers bros
anyone who says take ben out just remember that we cant draft bens back up because he fucking cries about it
looks through the thread and sees a bunch of people defending jujus dancing assholery by calling people boomers

remember when we were a tough and gritty fanbase of a tough and gritty city with a tough and gritty team that said everything it needed to say on the field during the game those were the days
i dont give a fuck that juju danced do better
yall blaming juju for that wtf ben got him sent to the shadow realm he throws a 1 yard pass on 3rd and like 7
how are these fucking retard announcers not talking anything about the helmet to helmet
these announcers are so fucked
finley has more rushing yards then the steelers do
they review it and still not see the helmet to helmet smh
wheres duck hodges me unironically
how the hell did we go 110
if we go 3 and out again give me mason ill get downvoted idgaf something needs to change someone needs to light a fire
ben aint even letting plays developers hes going to his first progression and chucking it this team wont win another game playing like this
lol and this team is supposed to compete with the chiefs
yet ben wont review anything on the tablet wont practice throwing the football or talk to anyone then hell come back and throw another pick and do the same thing while acting like a complete dickhead on the sidelines

ladies and gentleman your qb
put dobbs in ben is done for tonight
the espn crew is so bad that they are saying this is because of the bengals playing so good oh lord the muppets were so much smarter
all i want for christmas is literally a single first down
most qbs go straight over to the bench and look over stuff ben just puts his coat and hat on and shakes his head lol
hey alejandro fuck off
ben has to be hurt right even that little dump pass was worthless why is he still in this fucking game
youd think this would be the kick in the ass the fo needs to go get a legit qb in the draft but we know that wont happen
my man samuels seeing ghosts out there running fucking out of bounds thats how much we dont wanna play the fucking game and how much we suck i dont know how we went 110 its a fucking christmas miracle our guys look out of fucking hand they look like they dont know what the fuck to do im venting my ass off holy shit edit seeing them heading to the lockers makes me wanna cry lmao they look depressed
ben is fucking cooked his arm seems like its shot give rudolph some time out there
looks like whatever tomlin said at half is working
somewhere some dude dropped dionte johnson in fantasy football and is losing his playoff match up with aj green as a starter thank you for your sacrifice
this is all part of the plan guys its a tomlin test

tell ben to suck in the first half so the team feels compelled to run the ball and make catches

tell the d to suck in the second half so that the ben can force us to victory

if we cant score 30 we wont win against mahomes its time to learn that against the bengals
anyone who thinks tomlin is coty is an idiot
steelers wrs finally open

big ben completely overthrows into a near int

if you dont like that you dont like steelers football
still need to move on from ben regardless of the ending here its just way too apparent age is catching up
cant defense finally force a turnover come on man get the ball back
4 on 1
into quadruple coverage seriously
christ your d gifts you some time and you just completely waste it what a fucking joke
playoffs i just wanna win a game
truly thought this season was gonna be something special now well be lucky to win another game
bunch of hypocrites spend all year crying how ben doesnt get any credit comparing his stats to mvp years of other qbs now you want him gone this sub needs to shut the fuck up sometimes
finley the 3rd string outplaying ben come the fuck on ben retire or fucking figure it out and play
did claypool do something to piss ben off
oh my god these announcers suck dancing on a logo has nothing to do with it who gives a shit
ben is playing not to get hit not playing to win
cant say you want more superbowls and then not fucking practice plain and simple

the dichotomy between ben and someone like tj watt is absolutely insane ben has no work ethic and it is fucking showing i dont care how old he is even tb is meticulous about his health and conditioning
lol i muted these fucks in the first quarter stop listening to them nfl media despises the steelers
we lost to the fucking bengals let that shit sink in
downvote me all you want ben is done his arm looks like shit
dpi

i have no problem with the dancing and neither did anyone else until we started losing
honestly throw mason in there if were gonna suck might as well spice it up a bit
110 was a straight fluke
holy fuck ben he is trying to kill someone
id imagine if the steelers lose this you wont be seeing juju on any logos the rest of this season lol and not by his choice
this team is so fucking idiotic for not going after a backup after what happened last season fucking tards
i told yall it was pi
imagine getting mad at juju for dancing when him and james washington are the only reliable hands on our team what you want him to do throw to himself
2 really bad throws by ben already
blaming fichtner when ben has missed on 3 wide open receivers is peak yinzer
sack record
holy shit we need a quarterback desperately
bengals back up better than ben
how on earth can someone believe rudolph will make this better that is really laughable
juju needs to stop dancing on fucking logos
honestly how is that not helmet to helmet and did juju really do his stupid dance again
who wants a drink im buying
fire fitchner
another suicide pass are you joking
wow really no flag for 3 mfers teeing up on a receiver before the ball was even close cool cool cool cool
what in the gd is ben looking at 2 times claypool is open and he decides to murder a wr
please hang it up after this season ben we honestly dont want you back next year
hey guys in case you forgot were 112 i sure as hell did
i personally blame the muppets
never thought id say this but ben needs benched
were about to get our ass handed to us by a 210 team if there is any chance to salvage a shot at the super bowl a big change has to happen at halftime and i think its benching ben
big ben is slow fat and cant throw anymore
rudolph the red zone rain deer should be out here
lol the lowest iq team in football
it is christmas so maybe it is time for rudolph
mason is not the answer this is a complete cluster fuck on offense nothing here is working bens not connecting when he does receivers are dropping o line cant keep up right now run game isnt a thing what do you really thing masons gonna do
ben went from a top 5 qb to a game manager who made all the right throws to a bum real quick
seasons over the biggest indictment of tomlincolbert is going to be how on earth was a succession plan at qb not ready to go going to waste a monstrous defense
tomlin is a great motivator but needs balanced out by an xs and os kind of guy there arent any on this staff and it shows plenty of other nfl teams scheme around deficiencies much better than the steelers and have been for years
steelers fans with eyes wow we barely beat a depleted ravens team this is concerning

steelers homers fuck off you fairweather fan
dont let this distract you from the fact that we fell down 17 points to the ryan finley led bungles gotta see a complete half
quit your bitching and buckle the fuck up were the pittsburgh goddam steelers
i like how now theyre all concerned about a player getting hit in the head
man this sure feels like one of those games where we end of having a chance but ben throws an int off a lineman tip
okarafor is fucking garbage
if this team getting humiliated on primetime isnt enough to cause some changes then im done all this talent wasted
quad fucking coverage math tells you someone else had to be open

they rushed 4 had 4 in the same place that 3 covering the rest of the field
what a stupid ass play leave randy on the tarmac

x200b

i had this post typed out before the play was even run because hes that predictable
how about the o line does their fucking job
i want us to get memed on so hard this team is disgustingly terrible right now
big ben has to practice everyday that or get benched you played like a fucking bum
i cannot wait for urinating trees video this week hes gonna tear into them soooo hard lmao
did ben accidentally roofy himself
bengals max score is 10 on a good day otherwise their max is 7 steelers just gotta get more than that and its game over steelers should also watch for onside attempts and fake puntsfgs because this is a desperate team
i hope we fucking demolish the bungles

steelers 0



please offense be good tonight
lets get out of cincy with a no stress win and no more injuries please
the game plan is simple get the ball to the italians washington
i hope we win the toss and take the ball need to make an offensive statement
this muppet intro is far better than the sunday night song
watch me throw it over that mountain
steelers starting the game with a nearpick fucking kill me
lmaooo play action how drunk did randy come to the game
1st down first heart attack steers dont disappoint
good fucking lord
welp thats something
if you dont like that 3 and out you dont like steelers football
good two day week of practice ben
need 10

throw 5 yard route he wasnt getting that no matter what
oh fuck not again
be ok
best case is neck stinger there
damn that looks bad
shit
our 1st drives being trash every game says a lot about the offensive coaching like this shit should be rehearsed and it should work over cincinnatis shite defense
well were off to a lovely start this evening
jesus christ that looked bad get up kid
definitely not a great start so far
the last month has been a fucking trainwreck
man fuck playoff wins i hope we can even field a team by the end of it
should have been a block in the back there wtf
was cincy penalized for the block in the back
bold prediction our defense scores more than our offense tonight
tj
attaboy tj
dpoy
thats my dpoy
here we go time to bounce back fellas
2 play actions and no runs
this offense is so fucking horrific
ughnothing in moderation huh
time of possession might need to be measured in eye blinks
rinse and repeat with this offense
5050 ball needs to be caught 90 of the time for a championship team
is ben just unable to throw now
how are we turning into the same team as last year
intermediate throws are there just off with the throws
im genuinely sadly shocked by how bad this team is i dont know how ben was so much more accurate earlier in the year but if you put another number and name on him right now youd think he was brock fuckin osweiler
3 near interceptions so far
how tf are we going to win a playoff game
ben is so bad
lets just keep stacking up sacks
can we get mike munchak back some how
so 00 tie
highsmith finally showing up there
thank god we have a defense
alright offense lets go please for the love of god
surprised they didnt call rtp there
who can punt the most this qtr
okay offense this is your chance make some plays or we all know how this might go
jesus christ
primetime stations were licking their chops to broadcast an offenseless somehow 112 team vs a team that has a qb ive never even heard of least we got muppets
2101
holy shit this offence is a fucking mess
this offense makes me wanna kms
well at least its not a 3 and out
do we deserve playoffs
well thats one way to get cincy in scoring position
this is embarrassing
what is even going on
thats on ben
annnnd now im just embarrassed
our defense is going to pass out from exhaustion after the first quarter at this rate
3 and out pffft watch this
they got a full normal week of prep whats the excuse now
this isnt necessarily making me more confident in this offense
but hey remember this sub is too negative we should be more positive about uh hmm
its hard to believe they practice at anything the offense does nothing well
the time hes under center what is happening to this offense
help
we may never run a play under center again
i know we have the talent and the right pieces we just gotta find a way to get this machine to click
this team sucks
losing 03 after the fg
tj is making that tacklete his absolute bitch right now
ben clearly wasnt ready for that snap bail us out d
haden lifts weights and higgins
there are a lot of happy feet on defense getting set
even if we win tonight this doesnt instill confidence that we are as elite as our record indicates
its so sad we can expect games like these because the team is too holed up in sticking with our guys even when theyre objectively failures why am i at a point where i miss todd haley why has sean sarrett been so bad as oline coach
bad body language coming from ben this game
everyone is gonna blame the oc when the oc is a clear ben puppet this season and the reaction to it has annoyed me so much
highsmith looking good so far
lol he turned his back to the los
finley sounds so bitch were good were good
glad they only got 3 from that
shake it off we slow started a lot of dominating games lets go
muppet night is right our offense looks like a shitload of muppets
let the muppets call offensive plays for us you cowards
at least watching our defense still gives me pleasure
they played our offensive coordinator playing the drums
i went 03 online in mortal kombat 11 today i just want one dub today guys
muppets are the best thing so far tonight
this offense is paper
this shit offense elite defense gives me serious mid2000s ravens vibes yeah thats right ben is kyle boller now
tj seems to be the only one that gives a damn tonight
you think animal from the muppets is available for rb
thank god for this d
not quite the watt dupree celebration but love seeing the one between watt and highsmith highsmith had the assist on the sack they will be doing this for at least the next three years
our defense is so good its amazing
i guess theyre just gonna let the guy covering tj false start every play
the defense made more progress towards the bengals end zone on that drive than the offense did lmao
d cannot keep saving our insipid o
dude imagine loving a chair mat so fucking much that you literally drop what youre doing and buy the chair mat company
our defense is as good as our offense is bad
cincy the worst team in the nflthe jets and jags would win by two touchdowns against the bengals
i think the offense as a whole might have the yips they are really struggling in a way thats hard to believe
dink and dunkyuck
i dont think losing yards is better than incomplete
im honestly convinced it doesnt matter whos on defense the fact that were the steelers everyone tries extra hard against them am i stupid for thinking this
this is now the worst offense in football period
its funny how the commentators are trying to convince us ben throwing longer than 10 yards is a threat to the bengals
why are we taking a time out
i love ben but fuck he can say he needs to play better all he wants in press conferences but he seems to be bitching out there and not taking responsibility
where is jaylen samuels havent seen him in a long time
bens throw look like when my 10 year nephew tells me to go long
hey that wasnt long but love the burst and decisiveness in mcfarland
4 possessions with 0 first downs dumpster fire
its a miracle were already in the playoffs lmfao
we suck
weak fucking arm lololol
good thing nobody had a chance to catch that pathetic excuse for a pass
we might be at a point where we fire fitchner in the middle of this game or we put a different qb in to shake up the offense cant be worse than whats currently functioning out there
10 plays

9 yards
this offense is so bad lol
thats like his 4th almost interception
we dont look like the best team in the division
no effort to come back to the ball im souring on dj
people are going to say we were bad this entire season and only won because of our schedule however we arent playing nearly the same level of football as we were before the two losses if we played like this all season we would have lost several of our games earlier
how are these throws consistently at the shins
running the same defense as the bills and its working again i think they can expect to colts and browns to do the same
people are going to blame fichtner just watch
we are seeing what happens when the defense doesnt gift the offense the short field
we called a timeout for that
fuck it put duck in
at least with mason at the helm they had an excuse
we cant keep putting our d on the field after 3 minutes of rest
if you think theres a single playoff team this team is beating you are delusional the most obvious one and done team ive ever seen
did diontae seriously just give up on that route
three 3 and outs and a turnover honestly i just want this season to be over this offense is disgusting to watch literally all theyre good for is tiring out our best defense since 08
they missed a false start on that one
tj watt literary got picked up
finley making ben looking pathetic
time to put mason in
so are they ever going to call this rt for holding or
not a lick of pressure when tj gets doubled
i literally cannot imagine a worse offensive start
this guys way better than ben he can actually throw the ball
werent the broncos in a similar position in 2015 and benched manning correct me if im wrong
i am now welcoming death into my life
its so weird its like no one on offense has any confidence right now
i just wanna order an afc n tshirt tonight
i know i should be focusing on how much my team sucks but whys monday night football so bad this year

bad angles terrible cuts and im pretty sure ive seen them fuck up the clock andor score at least once each game
its time for this org to grow some balls and tell ben to take a seat on the bench
i honestly cannot wrap my head around how bad our offense is theres nothing and there hasnt been anything for weeks its completely lifeless
guys look on the bright side

ben practiced the deep ball this week so now he cant hit the deep ball or any of the other passes
bengals game plan is run run run run run deep ball
this defense man single handedly keeping this game alive
i dont think ben elbow is ok its the only thing i can think of how hes this wildly inconsistent
at least our defense is having fun
hilton god
the real question is how many defensive tds we need to win this game
our defense is amazing
longest first quarter of my life
questionable fg attempt gives us good position
jeez hilton timed that beautifully
we dont have a fucking running game and the passing game is suffering as a result
thats damn near 6 the other way
my qb stinks man
wonder what excuses well hear from tomlin and ben post game this time
there should have been 4 picks by cincy already
hey ben can you fucking practice for once in your miserable fat fuck life
ben looks awful so far
we have to put rudolph in
were getting manhandled
claypool so open on that 3rd down holy shit
claypool wide
we need to draft a qb at this point ive said it before but it seems more urgent now
ben is fucking garbage
bro what the fuck
mother of god
this is embarrassing
that should be a fumble
honestly i wanna bench ben
bell hit juju with helmetho
helmet to helmet
the offense is getting worse tomlin needs to figure this shit out now
im not confident about the playoffs which sucks because the first half of the season had me genuinely believing we were super bowl capable this year i just dont know anymore
this is just plain fucking painful to watch holy shit
lol cant throw more than 10 yards
no team respects ben because its the same fucking plays either throw the ball down field and take the hits play under center or make the switch to mason
ben literally cant move in the pocket and everyone knows it the play calling is also atrocious nice route on 3rd and long
where is duck when you need him
we might as well put rudolph our there
finchter has to go
hey guys remember we are a playoff team s
ben looks awful im not so sure he does give us the best chance to win
so like 3rd 4th game teams completely sitting on these 35 yard routes and our solution seems to be a bomb first play of game and then just go back to ineffective dink n dunk got it
we cant survive with this offense whats the point of even throwing that to the line of scrimmage
every good afc team other than the colts play outside not sure ben can throw it outside it the cold
ryan finely wouldve thrown to clay pool
how is that not helmet to helmet
this is gonna be a fumble i can feel it
bench ben please
ben is playing so bad and scared
3rd and out on 17 of last 30 possessions 56 how can you expect to win in the playoffs with this shit
helmet to helmet and no targeting calledbs of the highest order
boy our offense sucks not even an overreaction when were struggling to get a first down against the fucking bengals
sometimes you cant throw it in 00000001 seconds every fucking play gonna get our receivers killed doing that shit
i picked a terrible te to quit smoking
their ball fuck this offense
no 15 yard penalty is an embarrassment to the nfl
leading with the helmet anyone
im not sure how some of you expect juju to hold onto that ball that was a huge hit
man wtf is happening to this team
this is probably the worst offense on a team with a winning record in the league

and that has nothing to do with the fumble it has to do with the play calling and ben being garbage
two fucking fumbles in the first quarter
i hear very faint quacking
defense does not deserve this
why is ben playing like a really bad version of the bad version of tommy maddox
honestly i dont even think thats jujus fault is ben trying to get his receivers killed
jesse james no catch

ju ju catch
see guys we finally caught the ball

we lost it but we still caught it
teams dont respect bens deep ball and hes proving them right
theres no swagger on the offense everyone just looks disinterested or just there

show some fucking passion or anger or something light a fire under your offenses ass ben
that was on ben
thank god its the bengals tho

they suck as well lol

well with this field position at least our defense wont be as tired for the next 3 and out
is it possible to give up a playoff spot for a draft pick at this point
gonna be a long fucking night
ryan finley has more rushing yards than the steelers offense has total yards
hard to watch
worst quarter all season by far
fell asleep what did i miss
i am at the point of not even wanting to watch this shit i hope we lose out fire randy and get a backup qb to light bens ass on fire he knows were not putting in rudolph over him
ben better come out after the half throwing heat and our receivers better act like they got hands
ben talking about lack of toughness after making veiled threats to retire at the first signs of adversity gotta love it
steelers throwing to play the bills
wow we suck were looking like pretenders not contenders
rip kevin greene damn good player
rip legend one of my favorite old school steelers
rip kevin
wtf are we doing right now we dont belong in the playoffs
offense is anemic defense is presumably exhausted and playing with a multitude of injuries as always refs not helping us out the sad tale of the last few weeks
i feel bad for our d
its almost like if you wait more than 2 seconds to throw a ball you can complete a pass
ryan finley is outplaying ben wtf is going on today
can we get a new qb oline and oc for christmas
this is so sad its hilarious
wow so thats what its like to get first downs
finley better start sliding or hes gonna get fucked up
i mean this isnt new this has been going on since the 1st ravens game the steelers had 41 1st half yards in that game
ryan finley is the offensive mvp of this game somehow
this is embarrassing
who is responsible for finley on read option
fucking embarrassing
darkness imprisoning me
the standard is the standard or something like that
not surprised
embarrassing
im pulling what little hair on my head out
guys i need to get drunk faster so i dont feel the pain that brings me this game
i am kind of to the point of not wanting to watch the rest of the game
yo if we cant beat the fucking bungals we dont deserve to be in the playoffs seriously wtf is up with ben tonight
ben is mad
hate to say it 10 points seems absolutely insurmountable
oy vey
the defense is still goodbut the offense just died its almost like the fire ben had is just meh
come on its the bengals they dont even have joe burrow we can at least finish 124 right
i seriously dont understand how this team could change this much absolutely pathetic the past few weeks
i just turned the game on so juju did his dance and lost the fumble
0 first downs even bad nfl teams such as the bengals typically do better than that
well ill be the one fan who still has hope loooot of football left to play
yeah if we lose this one its time guys ben is not the guy he used to be hes better than rudolph but we will waste the window the defense will give us as long as we keep fichtner and let ben dictate how we run the offense
idk who the person was last week who chided me
when i said that we look uninspired but im watching them and againjust uninspired from the first play of the game it didnt feel like they were out there to win it felt like they were out there to avoid losing idk i hope they find it but i certainly feel uninspired
when you realize that the jets and bungles are playing better than your 112 division leading playoff bound teamwhere is the fucking whiskeyjust drown me
ben has 7 near interceptions out of his 10 pass attempts
hey look a running play
6 yard run feels like 20 with this team
go for it unironically
nice vision benny
go for it pussies
this stupid fucking run up the gut is why they dont fear our running game
dude snell had a lane and just ran right into a defender lmao what in the fuck was that
get the fuck out of here bitch ass offensive line
i honestly might turn this off
end me now
softest oline in nfl
omg we converted lets googooooooooooooo
a first down weve won the super bowl guys pack up the bags
lmfao we have to fullback dive as if were on the goal line
thats a first down we got one
these announcers can go suck pp
throw to triple coverage really ben is being completely irresponsible right now
how the fuck is that not pass interference
also oh my god when making a 4th and 1 feels like getting a touchdown holy shit
fuck the bengals dirty hits left and right
so i guess today you can just launch headfirst into wrs
ben just fuck off
were so fucking predictable
someone needs to send a yinzer momma down there to light their asses up put the fear of god in them
ben telegraphs every pass
so theyre going to let their secondary get away with everything tonight
ben just laying his receivers out to dry this game
benjamin what the actual fuck man
those 3 spots on those runs were bad by the refs wtf i mean they still got it in the end but still
maybe if we send the jets a really nice christmas gift they will give us darnold
i see this is bens method of discipline
im starting to thinkis ben a real life paul crewe
meanwhile the actual point of the play which is claypool getting open deep down the middle actually worked but ben throws into triple coverage his vision has been awful so far this game
it is simple ben doesnt want to get hit you cant play the game like that and be successful
ben got drunk before the game
clay pool now
alright this is just horse shit
mahomes is good and all but he puts ketchup on steak thats unforgivable
watching 7 for the last 15 years has been an absolute pleasure and a privilege one of the best ever

but its over and if he doesnt realize it the team needs to sit him down and come to jesus dont come back and eat up half the cap for another season of this
remember when watching ben play was exciting and fun

benny snell maybe finally realizes he can replace conner
fuck yes benny
tomlin bengals are tackling hard dont throw get your guys killed

ben ok

also ben lofts a ball into triple coverage to ebron
omg a 2 yard pass we are saved
diontae caught a ball
i hate these commentators
diontae johnson caught a ball
dj caught a ball what a fuckin miracle
offense is predicted
this play calling is an embarrassment
why is there never any blocking on the side claypool runs to its like randy wants the play to fail
going backwards again this team is so bad right now
ben is shit
put mason in im deadly serious
ben is done this is the worst hes ever looked
bench him
okay that was funny guys you gotta admit who was he throwing too lmao
better than mason
theyre laughing at us
theres no way ben gets benched right
season is over
ben is fucking garbage
ben would actually be superman if he took off the cape save the city of pittsburgh ben hung it up please
this is becoming hilarious
jesus christ bench ben at this point
so next time we go 115 can we start 05 and then rattle off 11 wins to finish strong instead of this
its like ben is drunk or something hes just awful tonight
this whole tram is one big embarrassment ben is done
bench him
ben is playing like a shell of himself today
we gotta try something different ben has to sit the fucking bengals
ben needs to sit down
so when during this game does ben retire
welp its been nice ladies and gents but i give up
this team has lost their heads
hope we lose by 50 no one is showing they want to even try to play at this moment
im going to need ben to take a piss test after this one
well guess im going to bed early you knowif theyre going to bench dj for dropped passesthey need to bench ben for horrible decisions
terrible throw by ben that route tree was also absolute trash 3 receivers within 8 yards fuck you randy
this bengals team is 2101 lmaooooo
bench ben now
where the fuck is the fight in this team does no one fucking care holy fuck
ben cant be qb next year this entire offense is built around protecting him and it clearly isnt working now that there is almost a full season of tape unless the oline is going to completely turn it around and allow for more than 5 seconds of protection ben wont be successful
im usually against comments like this but maybe bench him right now at least to rest
hes thrown into triple coverage three times already
ben is a fucking joke right now
can we retire our playoff spot i dont wanna get embarrassed by the dolphins or ravens
ben sucks
mason warm up
fuck
honestly just give the browns this division
theres still a lot of game left to play but this is becoming so hard to watch
forfeiting the rest of the season and playoffs would be less embarrassing
the jets would kick our ass tonight
complete freefall collapse
bench ben
fuck it out jordan dangerfield at qb only dude working hard
this team is fucked in the playoffs its going to be a complete disaster
145 point favorites down by 17 this team has huge problems and theyve done absolutely nothing to solve them
implosion
so this is it huh
put rooney at qb for all i care i dont want to see ben for the rest of the night
do we even deserve to make the playoffs
if randy and ben are still here next year im joining tomlin out lol
its that juju curse
tough for the defense to stop them when they have to keep coming out to our 30 every 5 minutes lol
put mason in
we need qb play that can not throw into obvious triple coverage and let our defense get some rest
the plan is to lose out and then win the super bowl duhhhh s
give ben more days off this week practice doesnt matter i guess
oh yeah the d has already said im done offense you got us in this mess time for you to dig us out
keep your head down ben shameful
god i was so encouraged by bens return and thought damn this dude really did the impossible at his age

if this is the end its a crushing way to see it happen
go steelers
welp the offense is currently beating our defense 170 and i dont think theyll be bailed out of this one
im going to go get some beer while you guys figure out how to fix this fucking mess
the defense is finally gassed from trying to cover from this jv offense it feels like our season is over losers of five straight heading into the playoffs likely to be bounced in wc game
the d is so gassed ben sucks balls
has an 11 win team ever been this bad
man idk what to think havent seen a steelers team implode like this in forever ben looks like shit but the play calling is ass as usual
is it too late to tank for lawrence
no chance we can make up a 17 point deficit
we actually just lost the division after starting 110
ben needs to find that porn stash again
the steelers last bona fide inside linebacker is now hurt avery williamson is being helped off he and marcus allen are all thats left at the position
im honestly perplexed at whats going on the offense is literally self sabotaging itself i cant understand it for the life of me ben literally looks like hes trying to throw the game im not jumping off em at all but something isnt right something is very very wrong with this team now
2 fucking yards ben needs to drop back get hit to wake the fuck up and play
am i alive what universe am i living in what the fuck is happening
baker would be making those passes
they realize we clinch the division if we win this game right play like you want that fucking spot this is sad i was hoping for high energy to lock that spot but here we are
my neighbors are ravens fans how am i supposed to face them tomorrow
youd think the planets would have to be aligned

clever
were literally just gonna get stupid ass oneliners and excuses after the game too no real calling out or anything

is it sad i think we cant come back from this because ben and the offense have been so predictably horrible i hate that i feel this way
could i interest you guys in sam darnold for a 2nd rd pick he could be yours
guys we have to get it together this is ridiculous
its obvious the short passing game is a result of ben having issues throwing the ball down field his accuracy on the deep ball is just dismal this year
well were not winning this one cant believe were 112
if we play like this the rest of the game i think the jets would blow us out
im ready for this 3 and out
is this how it has felt to be a jets fan this year
how is this offense worse from last year gimme duck and washington back please what happened to benny snell
ben looks like brady in that saintsbucs game where they got ass blasted 383 brady looked awful then kinda comparable to ben now
shocked the o line men got so far downfield usually they dont get past the line of scrimmage
wow i need 3 total points from ben to win the first round of playoffs in fantasy sitting at 4 right now
idk why i get so emotionally attached to this team probably not a healthy thing
munchak leaving was the worst thing to ever happen to us
wow people coming from teams subs who arent even playing to hate grow up
the bengals will never change always trying to kill themselves
this is incredible
we are so ass
why are we still here just to suffer
give me mason
if ben cant push the fucking ball down the field bench him seriously this is fucking ugly
can we let the defense play offense what can go wrong
why does ben feel so rushed
that dude owns juju
ugh i have to show up at work tomorrow
this is a nightmare
im thinking fichtner dials up some wildcat in second half some pure desperation
wondering if mason can do anything to turn this aroundugh
the defense has been sitting on short wrs routes all night sup with the adjustments and play calling
this stinks
i cant believe i actually want mason rudolph to come in
1 word unacceptable
anybody else just really really want to punch these announcers in the face
pittsburgh has 2 timeouts ya too bad we have no offense pal
if we dont score now i might have to turn this off for my mental health
juju dancing on logos isnt a big deal and there are many reasons why the steelers are losing this game but the defense is fired up is it because of the logo antics who knows but theyre out there trash talking him taunting him etc its hard not to think its giving them extra fire

but its the bengals we should win regardless of that so its weird
i really just want to get out of this half

ahhh so it can get worse
dissatisfied and disappointed
hausenher cant block
when you think it cant get any worse
give me rudolph or give me a shutout probably
all i can do is laugh this is fucking ridiculous
can somebody go start coughing in the locker room at half time so we have to forfeit
is ben fucking stoned
samuels you dumb fuck
why did he run out of bounds
wait why did he run out of bounds
fucking pathetic give me 145 mins of my life back
half time adjustments never heard of her
what is happening guys i just dont understand
so what do you think tomlin will do bench ben or just ride it out to an embarrassing loss
roast me daddy booger lol
getting ready for some of those famous tomlin sayings
this should have been a layup
we really went from a top ten offense to a bottom two offense in less than a season
yall saying bench ben should also be saying fire the gm who has he acquired to replace ben the injury shouldve been a huge sign we need a replacement sure the minkah pickup was good and he can get good wrs but none of that means squat if we have no future at qb
ben has lost steps but hes not as bad as his first half theres still a chance hell come out in the second and play decently which could still be enough with our defense

he could also keep this up
steelers december football baby
you know its bad when you find yourself thinking maybe they should bring out rudolph wtf
gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean up this mess
at least our future qb is mas oh i guess were fucked
we have more turnovers than first downs i had to refresh my browser to make sure that was right
solid 27 yards per completion
we are playing frustrated this is the bengals super bowl
do you think chase offers to film juju tiktoks or does he have to ask
shades of mannings corpse out there
got lucky there need to get a touchdown
guys mason isnt in
mason rudolph redemption arc poggers
why are people saying mason is in
ben is off today he is playing like a scared little undrafted qb
this is it
ahhh there we go
good things generally happen when you put the ball in mapletrons hands
guys the chiefs are nothing to us
hey the offense did something
that was a beautiful throw where has that been
maple tron
how in the fuck do they just do that after looking like garbage
i think im even more pissed now
come on boys
now thats a throw
lets fucking go are you kidding me were back
im supposed to be upset here dammit
the fuck
oh fuck they made him angry
where the fuck was this level of play earlier
thats the way get chase the ball more often
long johnson for the win
dont know if that was an aberration or if we are back on track
better late than never i guess
ben is back lets go baby
outta nowhere
well no chance of ben being benched now
lets fucking go
we riding now mfers
its happening folks its happening
ben is so good
wowthat was a dime
there is hope stupid stubborn unreasonable hope
the duality of ben
im not gonna settle down until we win this damn game
a time of joy this is indeed lego yoda our offense has life
do not go gentle into that good night
holy hell okay now the d needs to get us the ball back and we do it again
this is the way to give me hope
dj brought his hands today
that was surprisingly quick
thats a spark now we need a turnover
about fucking time goddamn
okay now we need to wake up further
the energy just went right out of the bengals see their faces after that throw
heres hoping the bungles blew their load in the first half lets go boys
i moved my 70s era terrible towel to a more lucky spot were ok from here boys
goonies never say die
i stopped watching and we score good night folks ill cya next year
turning point
did anyone else find statler and waldorf totally appropriate at halftime i mean if ever a game called for them it was this one
confused why everyone said about mason being in at the beginning of that drive

i officially dont understand this team
tj man
lmao that block on tj
tj watt makes me feelthings
tj deserves dpoy and this team is gonna fuck it all up for him
that was a fantastic defensive play from sutton
3 and out lets gooooooooooooooo
have a sample of that nerd
decided to tune in to the game because i like making myself miserable i guess and boom we score cant turn the game off now dont worry guys i got this
i know he made the tackle but fitzpatrick needs to wrap up
sutton you fucking stud
cam sutton i fucking love you
keep screaming yes rawr get amped
noice
since sutton didnt turn around i was worried that theyd throw a flag even though he didnt make contact early
heres the test i wanted the offense to wake up for this game but even just waking up for the 2nd half will make me feel so much better
tomlin probably put something in the cooler at half
i really hope they dont throw the season away because i want tomlin to get the coach of the year award
every fucking time with the useless juke
fucking offense woke up wtf did tomlin tell them at ht
benny snell
benny snell footballl
what the fuck is going on
please get juju involved i dont want to see more slander
this team is jacked up must have talked to bam morris drug dealer
i thought they might jinx boz with the stats there
those boswell stats omg
three points ill take it get tj and the d back on the field
defense needs a turnover feels like its been forever
lets fucking go
make it 31 for 31
offensive momentum keep it going and just dont turn it over surely the defense can continue to dominate so long as they dont get put in a bad spot due to turnovers
tj watt sack incoming
dj learned a lesson
very good drive we just need to finish in the red zone ill take the 3 though lets get a stop and take the lead
shall i summon my minkah jersey
dont blink boys dont blink
time for a good run back from ray ray
the steelers are looking like their undefeated form
ben walking like lamar but i think its because tomlins boot is halfway up his ass
what the fuck did tomlin say to them at halftime
nah hes fine boys we good we good
lol we cannot catch a break on injuries
thats bad bad
non contact no one around injuries are always awful
dude decastro is playing like a fucking ghost
plenty of time left good play by the defense punt well rested defense should be able to hold
no audible from benloss of yardage fichtner is literally incapable of calling a play to convert a third down
okarafor is fucking terrible
could have drove a truck through the hole to the left
benny snell is nowhere close to being a 3rd down back
come on steelers dont make me consider going back to bed this shit is nuts
i think the announcer can tone down his excitement some a little over the top buddy
i really wish we could pick up a fucking yard
benny sees grass and starts moving his legs no thought process behind it just straight gas pedal
vance just absolutely whiffed on that block not really snells fault there
fucking stupid jets were fucked for a fucking decade now dumb fucks
they can not give up a drive here
how many injuries is that this game
what a lucky fucking play
not again you cant blame the defense but if youre an elite unit you can turn it on in the 4th quarter this is a must stop situation
thats a dislocated shoulder or clavicls injury if ive ever seen one
we have no more lbs
ouch dislocated
dislocated
damn he wants to playwhat a dog
he was running he is no longer protected once hes running not a foul
ryan finley looks like fireman bill
my lord can the injury bug just leave us
stack the box they are only gonna run
are we really gonna lose the damn division to the mistake by the lake
nice to see allen back out there
offense in sideline looking a lot more positive
we cannot stop the elite bungals offense
defense turned to poop cool
absolute clowns
game over
this drive is a back breaker
steelers and giving up a key 3rd down name a better duo
great finlay is now lamar jackson
stop the run theyre not going to throw
offense finally looks alive

defense
utterly embarrassing
that one hurts
yeah no discipline there lol hes kept nearly every zone option
well that was fucking embarrassing
watt is good then what
lmao the steelers are making findley look like kyler
cringe
is there any accountability for this teamstaff
loss to wft barely beat a ravens team that was literally playing all backups loss to the bills and about to lose to the bengals lol rip whatever playoff game we get
rookie olb did rookie things
lololol what the fuck
dupree wouldve killed the rb and qb on that play
the defense is so confusing they look great most of the time then every 3rd or 4th drive they just get the ball shoved down their throat for an 80 yard drive or something
man imagine if we had bush and dupree still this defense
if we dont get a td on this drive then you can kiss this game goodbye
levy is fucking annoying
damn wears marvin lewis when ya need him
were losing by 14 to some napoleon dynamite looking motherfucker at qb
this game is still winnable but if cincy scores again its over
down by 14 run twice fucking genius
everyone who called the steelers a fraud were so damn right
i think we are just so hurt that last drive just proved it
down two scores with 11 minutes left and theyre trying to establish the run lol
i find the big brother little brother comparison kind of disrespectful its more like an abusive stepdad type of relationship
this is so sad benny and the defense have done everything they fucking can but these playcalls on both ends have buried us yet again our coordinators are this teams biggest weakness
did this dumb fuck just talk about bengals being hurt by injuries
to all the people defending the defense it is okay to blame them as well the d can be expected to limit points off turnovers while the d is good they make mistakes too and can be picked on

they are hurt but arent without fault
down 14 points a few minuts left run run
juju must have had his bell rocked if hes running out of bounds avoiding contact
down two scores with tens minutes left time to practice the running game
holy fuck is that a sign from god
ben should have like 5 interceptions already
ben imma give cinci the ball one sec
william jackson a steeler at heart
what

the

fuck

was

that
correct me if im wrong but isnt the defense supposed to not be tackling offense until they catch the ball
what the fuck hahahahahaha
4th dropped pick jfc
lol ben is trying hard to lose this game thats like the 4th dropped interception by cin tonight
gotta score here
is our team aware were down by two scores
hurry the fuck up o
we dont have time for dink and dunk
nobody fking cares about career yards lets go tonight
they are way too slow rn
3rd and 1 here comes a delayed run up the gut
had juju wide open
why in the world are we letting so much time run off the clock
randy sphincter is so fucking bad
get in the endzone quick
thats what im talking bout lets get a stop and put this shit to ot and to bed
this game is uhsomething
alright d game rests on you here
gotten bailed out so many times this game multiple dropped ints by cinci and penalties going our way at the right time
lol im sure nfl thread loved that call
someone tell highsmith to keep outside contain now
if we let kyler murrays white cousin run it again
alexa play renegade
defense has no excuse here they had rest
this gonna be a long 350
offense may have been ass for most of this game but the defense hasnt been much better
how are they even getting positive yardage on these runs its so obvious what theyre doing
when do we take timeouts
based minkah
great tackle
minkah
minkah wasnt letting them doing that again
thank you minkah dont squander it fichtner and ben
he hasnt been great but i do love me some 2 minute ben
first defensive play of the game lmao
good stuff minkah
thats right fuck you and your smirk
ryan finley looks like gary busey
2 minute drills start with a first down not a shot play
ah back to first half ben
good game
if they get a first down its over fucking just go for it
where were the other receivers at on the field on that last play
double covered that turned into quadruple wtf
shit it was actually on target


just made a defensive play
we shouldve rab the ball there and used the two minute warning to our advantage
just get us 10 fucking yds
absolute fiasco
terrible throw absolute shit
game ends on a bad throw seems appropriate
heads need to roll
jesus wtf was that ben dude is washed
anybody with a brain knew claypool was going to be the defenses focus there youre telling me no one else can catch a long ball
guys ben doesnt have it anymore
got dominated in the trenches ben played piss poor
this is our low for the season
browns will win the division
not a single first down on that last drive what a joke
we just lost to ryan finnely i honestly dont know what to say
idk who is more washed up big ben or big al
trask train at full steam
im curious is tomlin embarrassed
we are who they thought we were
insert bengals trap game joke here
this team is such a fraud oh my gosh
well that was fun
is it too late to tank for trevor
guys this one is going to be tough to win now
the way the steelers have played since the cowboys game this loss is not a total surprise
shouldve known when they had the muppets on the broadcast that this would be a mf clown show
so is it that ben cant throw or is it that he was getting pressured hard all night
we are the laughing stock of the league
jesus they cannot let go of juju dancing its all they can come up with
rudolph please lead this sleigh tonight
ficthner needs to be fired by the end of halftime
the steelers have sucked and didnt deserve to win but the officiating has been bad a lot of missed calls
the commentators say juju deserves an illegal hit for dancing on the logo lol what a joke
lucky we didnt get a pi on thative seen it called so many times when the defender doesnt look backthe momentum rolls on
these espn announcers are bums dear god
all three of them on ben
this is just a great omen of how things have been going for us lately prayers to d watt
this is bad chase claypool is inexplicably benched the play calling is vanilla as fuck and we dont have a run game i feel bad for our defense
ben is showing why the front office needs to get shit going in the offseason with replacing him
5 minutes in and were onto the 5th possession of the game amazing
we need fichtner gone before the playoffs period consistently slow starts and terrible play calling if our defense is on the field 70 of the game against an offense thats worth a shit it doesnt matter how good they are
fire fichtner at halftime
watt is the entire team like we have nothing going for us right now
we need to run the ball period ben and the receivers are trying too hard
yo im not coming to troll or anything i like yall team but whats going on with the offense
tomlin better change the fucking locks to the doors if ben is coming back next year

im starting to think we were the worst 110 team in history
lowers his head and hits juju in the face mask lmfao and these fucking idiot commentators wont say anything about it
is that not a 15 yard helmet to helmet
no helmet to helmet
so leading with a helmet creates a fumble and it gets over ruled
why is no one talking about how this is a helmet to helmet hit i can understand it not being flagged because it happened so quickly but they are just completely ignoring it
not a single mention of the helmet to helmet my lord
i try to stay positive and avoid the toxic people here but manthat was a horrible quarter of football
i know yall gonna blame juju for that but 1 thats a suicide pass by ben and 2 thats a nasty fucking helmet to chin hit that shouldve been flagged he should stop dancing on logos yes but thats not on him
if we were playing anyone with a half decent d wed be down 280 on pick6s right now
no more dancing no more bullshit play calls no more its gonna turn around

this offense needs to get its shit together these points are not on the defense 10 points directly related to the offensive turnovers

pick it the fuck up already
bench him for fucks sake hes not only fucking this offense hes killing his receivers
at this rate ill be offended if ben doesnt retire
why does he have the decision making of a rookie in his second start
absolute fucking frauds this team
google how to relinquish a playoff spot
as a rams fan i feel your guys pain
if we lose this game the browns will actually be favored to win the division how insane is that
zac taylor looks like mike pences son who was sent to conversion therapy and is psychologically scarred by it
with the colts and browns coming up what are the chances we finish 115
ben just refuses to throw deep wtf
so i know we came back against the jags like this but i genuinely cannot see us pulling off a win tonight this is just pathetic in every sense of the word
maybe ben will bench himself
this second half is pretty much the season if they can come back from a 017 deficit theyre proving that they have what it takes to win if they just get blown out and lose this game thats it that team will never beat kansas city
im confused is pittsburgh supposed to be tanking for a better draft spot
so let me get this straight

big ben had issues with todd haley taking over the offense despite having the best offense in the league however since ben didnt like him he had to go

so he goes and ben forces the franchise to make fichtner the oc despite being way under qualified and way over his head ficthner does nothing but acquiesce to bens every demand including running every play from shotgun

this jas resulted in the te having no run game whatsoever just to ease ben into an offense he wants to run then he gets exactly what he wants on a max contract with 19 yards in a half while we are set to lose se serious defensive talent in the offseason

what the fuck
guys even if we win this were going to get absolutely chewed out on social media
hey mike you notice how the bengals are now attacking the inside with the run likely due to our depleted inside linebacker corp now i know this is gonna sound crazy to you but this is called an adjustment you see coaching does not have to be static you do not have to stick to the same plan from start to finish many coaches take note of what is working what isnt and what happens in the game and modifies their game plan to fit these changing circumstances fucking insane right you and your staff should really just keep an open mind and try it though
this d just gave up 24 to carl edwards jr crazy
ryan findley dropped more point on this defense than josh allen did

and people have the nerve to make threads on here about how we can beat kansas city

absolute joke
making ryan finley look like lamar lmaooo
they sure are taking their sweet ass time down two possessions in the fourth quarter
love the td but it means nothing if our defense cant make a stop we need to get a quick 3 and out
alright now just knock finleys fucking teeth out of his head on this drive please
mike tomlin thinking if we have a quick three and out maybe we can save the two minute warning to stop the clock during cincys next drive really coaching on another level but that last throw just had too much airtime for it to work
guys i dont think ben can get us to the divisional round
so he was halfdragged down before the ball was there and no flag
when they were 110 i heard somebody say they were the worst 110 team of alltime seems about right
you know its bad when the announcers said we got jobbed
chase got held up flag no surprise
gotta get an offensive line if they want any sort of push in the future crazy how bad its gotten since munchak left
this has been very unenjoyable see yall next week
this loss is on ben
if ben doesnt show up to all the practices here on out he should forfeit being a guaranteed starter
each week gets even worse than the last we dont seem to care
steelers gonna go from 110 to wild card team smh
another embarrassing loss maybe they will get their heads out of their asses after this
whats the bigger joke

our offenseor bengals celebrating when 2101
this has to be the most tomlin loss of all time literally zero excuses ben fucking sucks now its sad to say but im ready to move on
big ben who claims he wants to win number 7 yet shook the team down for a max contract while running an offense where running is now impossible while having the best defense hes had since 2008

and yet somehow hes not the problem anything but him
where the fuck is the helmet to helmet call
everyone needs to chill the fuck out about juju dancing during warm ups and care instead about ben checking down to the los when he had claypool wide open for 15
never compare juju to hines ward again
ben fucking blows but you guys calling for mason lofl i will legit turn off the game if he comes in i saw enough of that shit last year and the three plays in the cowboys game this year

fuck this game though
let juju and conner walk next year fire randy beef up the line and get a better rb either draft a competent second string qb or tank for a ben replacement hes not making any basic throws anymore
lots of brigaiding pussies in here tonight
im sure ill get down voted to hell but its time to move on from ben he just doesnt have it anymore

unpopular opinion fuck the muppets
easily the biggest embarrassment in tomlins tenure i cant remember a bigger fuck up than this clusterfuck
steelers loyalty is a bunch of fucking fools man they had time to make changes but they decided to stick with whats not working like they always fucking do now were 2 weeks before the playoffs and down 17 to a 2101 division rival ive never been so fucking disappointed in this team and organization no cap
the commentators didnt say shit all game and then after that botched 4th down to end the game those fuckers mutter well that 3rd down was pretty much pass interference wtf where were you all god damn game with all of the bullshit not one fucking word so over this bs
where is chase claypool what the fuck fire randy fichtner before the offense goes out next drive
big ben must be drinking againor if not he will be after this game lol

he will be fine yall everyone has their off days or slumps or he may be getting tired from a long season but will bounce back when it counts idk how much this game counts but the steelers are looking pretty gravy so far at least your not like my ny giants

all this to saydont panic
im really losing hope with ben i think this is the end
tj watt just passed aaron donald and trey hendrickson to lead in total sacks with 13 they were each only up by 5 sacks 125
i really wasnt planning on drinking tonight
literally everyone at the line of scrimmage ben still cant get it down the field

its more on ben than randy boys

id rather watch them run the ball 3 times in a row see what happens
one big gain and they say the defense is giving up lmao i hate commentators sometimes
im officially stating the draft trask movement
anyone defending ben at this point is delusional
soooooooo nothing has changed in 4 weeks we have like 3 rush attempts and 3 completed passes on five fucking posessions

no first downs

so we just not going to throw flags for helmet to helmet
firerandy
get juju claypool and the whole defense outta pittsburgh we dont deserve them
we need to move on from this snellconnor duo they just arent cutting it
literally how the fuck is that not helmet to helmet
no one wants to talk about the fact that there was a blatant helmet to helmet that should have negated the fumble
that was fucked i nearly just yelled in the hospital my baby was born 7 hours ago so im calm right now but im on the verge and my blood is boiling this game is fucked if they cant review a play or challenge for a head hit fuck this bs the bungles are playing
110 then possibly 05 2020 is truly the worst in a lifetime
good job making 210 team with 3rd string qb looking good

x200b

worst 112 team ever
why are people blaming juju pretty much everything shitty thats happened was bens fault
juju pregame speech let them do the fucking work we will do all the fucking dancing
another headshot cool we have more headshots then passing yards
ben has looked horrific tonight
wow missed claypool
lets throw a murder ball into triple coverage
ben is trying to kill all the receivers tonight
big ben is making bad decisions
man im the biggest ben fan you will ever meet but what the fuck is happening
thats just a bad choice on bens part wow ya dont say thats how many plays ben has ignored claypool im so frustrated watching this dude
tell me four weeks ago wed be down ten to the bengals and the only thing working for us is the running game and id beunsurprised actually lol
wtf bench ben rn
its mason time guys if anything to try to get bens head out of his ass

edit and no i dont think mason will do any better but ben needs to sit for the rest of the game
definitely taking the l now i have zero faith in this offense to even get a first down right now
im just here for the comments
ben currently has 2 yards and an int
the problem today is ben snell and the defense have been good receivers have done their jobs for the most part
tomlin needs to take the team to the locker room and ben to the glue factory at half
so can we sit ben yet or
if youre here and youre stressed out just pause the game close your eyes and take 5 deep breaths well still be awful but it might help

i legitimately hope they lose this game bungles should be hype as fuck right now i certainly would be juju better not say fuck all for the rest of the season
fuck i hate rnfl post that a guy clearly taunting is a good call and the only reason people think it was weak is cause the steelers player was smart and didnt react now i cant post for 10 mins cause the haters downvoted
ben will lead the team to a come back in the second half dont lose faith
so uh just tuned in and now i would like to crawl into bed and cry

i fully expected to lose but not like this
cant wait for mahomes to absolutely toss our salad
tomlin better be throwing a fucking trash can or a chair or something

dude never shows any emotion really
you know whats going to suck worse than losing to the browns in week 17 losing to the browns in the playoffs the next week
why are the muppets involved with this
rudolph is here to save christmas everyone
alright lets go dont wanna look like the london sillynannies again
the killer bs are back boys ben boswell benny
if the bengals had a decent qb this would be alot worse
haha that is like the 4th time they ran that
sooo ever since tuitts tweet talking shit weve been ass almost like the karma gods were like my guy your 110 stfu
but but i was told barely beating the ravaged ravens team wasnt concerning at all

still undefeated s
the browns are gonna win the division arent they
down by 7 in the 4th against the team ranked 30 of 32 not cheering a game that should have been out of reach at the half
thats the right call boys hes been getting away with it all night too its about time they called it
i cant even imagine how pathetic the post game press conferences will be if the steelers lose this game i guarantee you the tomlin one will be full of your typical we accept responsibility we make no excuses bullshit despite the season being all but over
im proud of our team tonight they showed great competition against a tough 2101 bengals team with their third string qb it may have been a loss but it was a win in my book
fucking why honestly fuck you
that arm just cant make it anymore
no pi
not even a catchable ball
1st to 3rd seed in three games lmao
ben getting slammed as he threw and yall put that last pass on him lmao

blame ben for like 99 of this but that was definitely not on ben our line is atrocious
oh good at least the broadcast calls out that it was completely dpi that makes me feels better
this is worse than the oakland loss a few years ago
pittsburgh didnt even show up tonight fucking pathetic
blows my mind that someone can almost get seriously and i mean seriously fucking injured and the refs just let it go meanwhile they call ever slight touch in the back every other time but one directly leads to an almost broken neck or spine and they just let it ride the nfl is seriously a joke
unpopular opinion fitchner has changed the offense to focus on short passes because he doesnt have confidence in the line or in bens arm anymore
he keeps missing claypool you cannot make this shit up
ben needs to be disciplined for this shit make him sit a game and see how he feels about playing like total dogshit
it needs to be mason even if for a drive ben is pathetic right now literally everything bad is because of his decision making
i love how juju gets blown up and fumbles so now all the juju haters get to crawl out of their shitholes and start trashing him in case yall forgot hes our only reliable player and the only reason he hasnt done anything is because every route hes told to run is garbage none of this is jujus fault you boomers
ben is really hurt has been for three or four games now the game plan is just to cover it up you cant change my mind on that at this point

the fact that theyre down by 7 in the fourth to the bengals is just beyond ridiculous
unfortunately i just dont see anyone on kc losing sleep about facing the steelers
3 people behind and 1 person clinging on to claypool is not 4 players on claypool it was the right read but he underthrew it and the questionable pi wasnt called
fuck this team i was actually less stressed last year fuck this
dont worry guys ben got 60000 passing yards that means more than a win right
can we get a gofundme to pay juju to delete fucking tiktok
lot of energy lot of focus
here we go lets bring the north back to pittsburgh
one would believe that this is the perfect opportunity for the offense to get going but we know how the steelers perform against teams like this hope they surprise us
run up the middle for no gain dropped pass 4 yard completion punt god please dont let that be our first drive again
ben looking chunky im predicting a good game
getting settled in at work got a new oven so i made a ham mashed potatoes corn and rolls for the game im ready to get fat and feel good about beating the shit out of the bengals lets fucking go
a lot
i hope muppet night football is a one and done thing oof i want my daughter to watch football because its exciting and athletic not silly
the muppets are commenting football this is peak 2020
i dont think this offense is good enough right now for this to be a blowout but i am expecting a comfortable win where it never feels like were in trouble
ben defs looks like he got into the christmas sweets early gonna be hard to take down
dear 8 lb 10 oz baby jesus
good o better d soecial teams on point no injuries
muppets
see the ball into your
beaker
im gonna kill my self by halftime if this shit continues
glad to see we still are traveling well
since when are you a bengals fan

since i found out youre a steelers fan

lmfao i love these muppets
is it just me or does it look like theres more steelers fans there

dude shouldve caught that pick lol
lmfaoooo he was wide open
dpi uncalled of course
wow james burned him but of course the underthrow
ben is having a tough time
nothing like three and out to start the game
start the game with a deep ball check

run on 2nd and long check

3 and out check
i hate this offense lol
how long until diontae has his first drop
wow was that play action
ben said not to panic but he hasnt been giving us something to be hopeful for
watt just killed himself
damn derek watt is out cold
fuck man please be okay
oh my god
oh man that looked horrible
stop the count
uhhh
fucking bungels
fuuuck that looked an awful lot like the fencing response
3 and out but the boys look energized positivity people lets go now
weekly cracks open beerhere we go again post
rip those hopes of derek playing fb today and hello concussion protocol
hey guys just hopped onhope derek is ok
steelers kneeling on the field is freaking scary i hope hes ok
shazier flashbacks prayers up for derek
fuck that was a big hit i hope hes okay
this teams whole vibes are off
thats just straight up not safe
our ol must be truly terrible if even cinci can run behind theirs
lmao no block in back wtf
why dont we use power runs like the 31 other teams in the league
amazing job tj
watttttttt
where is vince
teej lives behind the line of scrimmage
tj
dpoy
well at least the bungles cant run the ball either
now we cant even see if dj will drop it or not lol
fucking hell
that play action fooled absolutely no one
ill be damned 3 n out what a surprise lol
we are one and done in the playoffs clearly the offense didnt practice in spite of the extra day this week
3 and out good stuff
dude i cant do this again
was ben the problem this whole time please tell me no
so like wtf has happened to this team
ben getting knocked down regularly tonight
pa is good and a welcomed change but ben needs to hit those
i cant tell if its injury confidence or ben is just cooked
we have reached comical levels of offense shades of last year
this offense is quite literally as bad as last year these days what the fuck happened
william jackson is an underrated corner its still a shame he didnt end up in the black and gold
we need 5 downs
what is this garbage offense were like a parody of ourselves at this point
well at least barry is booming
wheres chase
teams may want to play the steelers
i appreciate that theyre throwing it to get that connection but damn ben is just not accurate at all his arm isnt bad he just cant get the target
in fairness ben tends to be a streaky passer right right
i guess cincy too good for ben
bens not playing very wellhopefully hell get his shit together but right now not good
what is the record number of total punts in a game btw asking for a friend
i never imagined this years offense could be worse than last years but here we are
calling the right plays wrs doing what they need to do and ben cant do shit
3rd and short better huck it downfeild
jordan berry highlight reel grows every week
just tuned in for that last series how did we look on our first drive watching the 2nd doesnt give me much hope the 1st was any better
almost have a punt per minute so far
now i have to watch our offense play
anyone else get nervous with mccloud returning punts
sooo are we going to try to run the ball this series or are we going to keep throwing off target passes
what yinz think will run here to go 3 n out
alright ben i love you man ive followed the steelers ever since your rookie year so please play better for me
offense is looking rough still but its nice to see some play action
this is genuinely tough to watch
can we just forfeit the season
lmao
fucking pathetic
fuck
this is just sorry
are they fucking hangover or something
are you fucking kidding me
what a clusterfuck
oh my god
this shit is so embarrassing
oh its definitely going to be one of those games
hey as i see it a 1 and out is less painful then a 3 an out
niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice
i was about ready to blame hassenhauer but im surprised it was pouncey
ahh he stinks today
this fucking team man
im not really ok with how this game has started
at least its not a 3 and out
when did this offense become the fucking jets jesus fuck
guess bens sticking to shotgun the rest of the game lol
is it bad im not even mad its just so par the course the last few weeks its starting to feel normal
we are not winning a playoff game in our current state lol
lol dude we cannot take an l to a team with what is practically the reverse of our record this has been embarrassing so far at least the d is looking good
at least they didnt punt
here we go again lol
our offense looks like absolute crap
good tackle by haden at least
offensively it can only get better from here
seems like that washington loss demoralized the offense completely its tough to watch our poor defense having to deal with the ineptitude of our o
this is fucking embarassing
nice sack
honestly id be more worried if this team wasnt fucking everything up in the first quarter
because randy makes the man throw 51 times a game his arm is fucking tired

hey guys this dude figured out why ben cant make easy throws what a genius

if only brees mahomes wilson rodgers werent treated so poorly to have to throw a lot xd
we complained about 3 outs the first 2 drives then they turned it over the first play last time im just not going to expect anything this next drive and see how that goes
highsmith seems to be making more plays each week really like his progression williamson also with a nice stop on that 2nd and goal run
as soon as i got rid of my terribles towels theres a sack coincidence i hope not
im not worried just disappointed
so anyone taking bets one wether our offense or defense will score first i got money on defense
at this point every afc team in the playoffs would beat us probably every nfc team too a sad pathetic one and done to cap off a sad pathetic season
why do things like the muppets last the test of time i feel like theres usually a yearly muppet thing going on where is the muppet money coming from
offense about to light it up
what your opinion of taking one the qbs early this draft
that might be the only score we see tonight
our offense fucking sucks
holy shit were really not running it ever huh
av whiffs on the block
still no runs
anemic
we havent gotten a first down have we
is chase hurt or is washington that good
lb ulysees gilbert sustained an ankle injury and is questionable to return tonight
randy said we are gonna try different things because it sure as shit looks the exact same as we have been doing
this is utterly embarrassing the bengals defense is not good
wasting time outs like theyre wasting this defense
why is rayray playing over any of the top four receivers that was a three wide set with him on the field
i didnt realize a bunch of snails were playing for the steelers tonight
man its about to be another 1st quarter with 0 points by the offense thats 5 straight 1st quarters where the offense has put up goose eggs these slow starts are killer and that says a lot about the oc and game planning
wtf ben
randy feetner

sounds about right
dj just watching the ball bounce around
bens arm looks horrible tonight like every throw he makes is missing strength
ben literally aged 40 years in 4 weeks
only one more season of this
i dont think i can stomach this offense holy shit they are awful
we are the worst 11 and 2 team and im not capping
remember when ben said this offense was a b
four possessions no first downs and a fumble can you saysuper bowl
man we cant catch a break lately not giving the defense a fucking break either
wow benjamin had so much time despite the all out blitz and couldnt hit a wr
i think we have a better chance of scoring on defense
lmaooooooo i dont even want to watch the playoffs anymore
they are just daring us to throw deep no respect for ben at all
10 offensive plays 3 3 and outs and a fumbled snap
the team looks lethargic
this is pathetic
bad throw but what the fuck was that route he gets to the top of the route turns and then just kinda hops a few inches in the air
put berry at qb
i dont know which i am more angry with the broken storm drain under my house or this offensive unit
cant even get 10 yards
what the fuck am i watching
incoming relax guys comments this shit has been going on for weeks why would anyone relax ffs
there was just nothing on that throw at all its like watching broncos limp noodle peyton manning again

maybe having your 38 year old qb with a repaired elbow throw the ball 50 times a game was a bad idea
so thats what a pass looks like
the fucking bengals cant do shit against the bengals yeah but the rams lost to the jets good teams lose to bad teams

this is now what the 4th week in a row the offense is pitiful im venting here but man it just looks so bad right now
i mean not getting a first down in the first q against the bengals isnt great but its also not good
defense is gonna wear down eventually
extremely lucky that wasnt picked
that is a dead arm
help me
bens arm is done he cant even throw 7 yards with any zip

but for the second year in a row we have no one capable of backing him up
why cant our offense do that
jordan berry do be a good punter though
i wonder if bob will give us watson for some skittles
i cant wait for ben to talk about hangin it up again in his post game presser
rookie qb equals instant win against our shitbag team
no way we arent going one and done in the playoffs yo

we sit here with 3 minutes left in the first quarter and ryan finley just out gained our entire offense in one throw
when do we make a change on offense thing is im not even sure what you do but they need a reset this was supposed to be a get right game literally the last chance of the regular season if we dont figure out here i dont know that it can be figured out
the offense looks out of it they shouldnt against the bungles but ig this is the team we have now
heres where finley starts to look like brady
finley better than ben
whacked his back brain
why cant our offense adapt man it is sooooo frustrating everyone has the dink and dunk shit figured out old stubborn fuck randy refuses to change i hate it
we should just never have any bengals steelers games
qb or a rb in the first round what you picking
pain
why is our offense so bad
ben is playing ryan lindley bad right now
were the 2013 chiefs

im already prepared for the 28 point blown lead
how hard is it to retire ben its not worth it we need a new qb
so many fucking commericals
might need to put mason in need a live arm slinging it
by the 2nd half defense is gonna be worn out again and have more injuries same shit 3 or 4 straight games now
terrible playing terrible coaching we look like one of the worst teams in the league
seriously thought that postmates commercial was for prescription drugs for a sec good commercial lol
3rd and 7 and the bengals put nine defenders within two yards of the line of scrimmage thats whats wrong with the offense
the defense hanging on for us
finleys got balls to run up the gut like that
mike fucking hilton
hilton is such a stud at blitzing
lets fuck some moms and chuck some bombs
theyre not scared of our offense thats why they did that
fire randy fitchner
is that the closest the offense has been to the end zone lol
averaging less than a yard per play fuckin amazing
can we complete a pass holy fuck
this is just comical at this point
roethlisberger could have been picked three times today
ben if you could not throw dangerously close to the defense for one play that would be real great
rtfb
where my team gone
wow ben is high on drugs or something
at a certain point we need to just start going for it on 4th down this is ridic our defense is going to be exhausted
im going to give it the 2nd quarter 1st quarters can be wacky 2nd quarters decide what kind of game it is if its 100 at half im reaching for my damn pitchfork though
why did ben throw that 5 yards short of the first down
i dont know why this is but this is not an offense
bench ben
we just ran the same set 3 times
if you dont like a single first down in the first quarter then you dont like steelers football
this offense is horrid a pathetic embarrassment
this is what happens when you cant run the defense only has to key on the passing game and can shut it down
thats a fumble imo
punting for what the 5th time in one quarter yeah thats not a good sign
holy shit this offense is the worst in the nfl we are screwed
man ben missed a wide open claypool
ben what the fuck
so we throw a screen then a fucking 3rd down throw to the line of scrimmage figure it the fuck out
nearly a hospital pass
oh look another pass behind the line of scrimmage
why is that not a helmet to helmet hit
thats a catch fumble

and claypool was open
clay pool wide open but lets dump off to juju get him killed and wouldnt had been a first anyway love it keep it up ben
if fichtner is not gone after this season im boycotting this is a fucking disgrace no reason for that dimwit to be in the nfl
thats definitely not a catch
have we even made a first down yet
how do we go from undefeated to we suck again big ben looks lost deer in the headlights lost
play calling is gonna get one of our receivers killed
this team has died
oh my god i know juju didnt dance on their logo
i miss charlie batch
is this cause ben doesnt have a december beard
that sure looks like a fumble to me
claypool just getting ignored the last couple weeks
helmet hit no call its definitely a fumble our offense is so far beyond pathetic
hey thats h to h lol
dude wtf is ben and the offense doing defenses are keying on the short passes you gotta throw further than 05 yards past the line of scrimmage its obvious as fuck how the fuck cant our coaches offense figure it out before that pass was even thrown 2 people already running at juju they know its fucking going there
honestly this team deserved to be clowned by these announcers these teams are so far apart in talent there is no excuse
wide open claypool wtf ben
this is the biggest fraud team ive ever seen jesus i cant imagine getting both sides of the ball playing well
i just cannot even be fucked watching this shit anymore last year all the talk was oh but well be fine with ben back now we cant even use that excuse its absolutely fucking pathetic
idk how randy has a job after tonight i really dont
what is grease talking about hat on ball thats the fucking crown into the face mask
worst ben has looked in a long time
lol im not even mad that was karma on live prime time hopefully it humbles him
guys that is 100 a fumble
get rudolph in
looked like he hit him square in the facemask with the crown of his helmet
how the hell do we go from scoring 21 regularly to just trash trash trash trash did the mon stars come steal their powers
fucking bench ben until hell perform or retire the steelers are here to play football and win not strike the ego of a formerly great aging quarterback his inability of unwillingness to stretch the field is laying his receivers out to dry
that had zero chance of a first down
im not angry im just disappointed severely disappointed
seriously am i in the twilight zone
what was that about physicality i dont think we heard that word enough times in 20 seconds
im starting to think this play calling is bens fault
juju looks like he has a concussion
ben fucking sucks today ive seen at least 3 dropped ints and that pass was asking juju to get whopped
scumbag refs
im glad this game is on mnf team 100 deserves to be embarrassed
sucks it was juju but that was a sick hit
offense is anemic
longest 1st quarter of my life
alright anyone of you guys want to go in for ben
go fuck yourself espn
whats really disappointing about this is that its a continuation of what weve seen since the dallas game we havent been able to adjust at all in months

sucks man
ben playing scared had a couple easy open throws and is too afraid of the pass rush so he takes the underneath or check down old lion getting ate up by baby jackles
the offense sucks ass
that genuinely may have been the worst quarter of the season and against one of the worst opponents too
opposing defenses have figured us out cant run and ben cant throw it more than 10 yards every linebacker is sitting on underneath routes trying to pop guys or pick it off
why did i get a juju jersey instead of minkah at least its a throwback
for a couple weeks i forgot what it felt like to be a steelers fan but its coming back to me
when a stopable force meets a movable object
how did we become the jets in three weeks
embarrased this is on primetime
the jags game is the last time we looked competent on offense
man rip kevin greene
at least they showed the zone read early adjust now
are we gonna lose this game honest answers only
next possession 3 runs if we cant get a first we pack up and leave i will any way anything better than watching this
steelers had as many yards after one quarter as they did turnovers 2
corvette corvette
this is a 2 win team btw
2101
this team aint making it past wild card weekend
we need to take some lessons from the ratbirds on punching balls
lol if they score another td its over
holy fuck that was too easy
dandy juuuuust dandy
this is fucking sad
holy shit this team is burnt toast
fuck this
the d can only do so much
ben is scared to get hit hence panicking in the pocket if he hasnt thrown the ball within 1 second
whats the excuse this week

even if we win its the same problems with no solution wasted year also tomlin should tell juju no more of that bullshit the jets can give him 17 if they want to good riddance if this is who you are going to be
if we throw one more screen im turning off the game
imagine we divide our season into an 11 game winning streak and a 6 game losing streak
scoring drive im calling it big scoring play from claypool lets gooo
the throws behind the line of scrimmage clearly are not workingkeep trying them
so this is embarrassing
we really need to be looking for our future qb bens time has come
5 yards great
i should bet the under on every steelers game
i dont even know what else to suggest at this point running isnt working throwing isnt working fuck
so who wants to admit we are gonna go 06 to end the season
this offense looked better last year with duck hodges and no passing game were as easy to counter right now as any team if youre one dimensional and in that one dimension youre limited nfl defenses are going to figure you out quickly
whats a first down
can we ask the cyberpunk 2077 team to show the nfl how to revoke our playoff game like they did with their video game
420 for 5 yards yikes lmao
charlie batch is coming back
is that a firstdown holy shit no way
look we doubled our yardage
ref marked that a full yard short
whoah snell got more than 2 yards fuck me sideways
positive yards here we goooo
fucks sake man
lol randy fichtner isnt getting any fucking credit
hahahaha called it

he ran into the back of his own lineman

run a damn qb sneak
we need a good running back i like james but hes a 2nd stringer snell and mcfarland would be practice squad players on other teams
holy fuck cannot get one fucking yard
bad spot he was way beyond that
better to be lucky than good i guess yikes
a first downdilly dilly
what is with these shitty spotsmm he got the first down fucking twice before 4th
flag hello what
first down baby
softest steeler team of all time
announcers so fucking pumped they didnt convert on 3rd
pass interference
they were early as fuck
first dahn
no flag dirty fucks
oh what he wasnt stopped let the play go refs jfc
somebody dance on the logo we have a first down
triple coverage
can we not buy a fucking call
louis riddick is great the other dude can suck my dick from the back also i guess the hit on defenseless recievers wasnt in effect today
barely got over the line mightve had contact before the pass got there wtf
anyway whatre yall drinking
please run the ball please
this is a fucking train wreck lol
pittsburghs offenses wooos continue
ben needs to progress through his reads looks like a rookie tbh rn our o line might be bad but he has time to make a lot of these throws
ben sucks
snell had the first on third down that was dpi ben isnt making good reads but at least hes throwing farther than 3 yards down field
seems like bens predetermined to where hes going to go with the pass not sure why other than hes trying to build guys up or hes just gotten lazy on his reads really hoping its because hes trying to build guys up
how likely is it that hes having trouble with his arm theres been a lot of underthrows in the deep game over the last few weeks and shit like that ebron pass tells me hes looking away from the deep game
claypool is out of bens reach tonight he cant sling it
claypool open every play
claypool has been opened a few times but ben just missing him reads are ass now
seems like the whole offense has the yips
bens making wrong reads i rarely ever seen him make could be watching bens last 4 games to come
ya flag on us but no fucking pi flag
okay i see you benny probably the best run weve seen in like 3 weeks
that feels like our best run in 3 weeks
good night guys may you rest in peace
thats some benny snell foobau
benny snell hitstick
that was an excellent jump cut and read like why cant he do that every time
benny turned on the jets
wow look what happens when you actually try to run the ball
i just got back from christmas events fun but long and pretty stressful seems like the game is not going to help
benny snell is benny swell
holy shit guys a first down remember those
there is nothing creative about this offenses whatsoever
snell popped that mf for juju
keep running snell fuck ben
apparently mapltetron is going to have to use the force to get a football in his hands tonight
ben laid out the dancing clown show juju and ebron accident
stupid ass shit play
also someone remind me never to go on rnfl again
damn it randy
predictable so predictable
great call there coach
wow what a unique play that weve never ran before
our line is old
i dont blame you for being upset claypool
not what we had in mind when we said involve claypool but ok
bench ben
at what point do we bench ben
why dont we have the balls to fire randy
maybe throw to claypool instead
the one fucking time they want to give claypool a touch
take ben out man
bench ben
what an amazing play randy fichtner came up with right there how does he come up with them
called that one
can ben see
holy that throw was dog shit
i dont care if mason sucks anymore lol ben is a genuine liability
at some point ben deserves to be benched
ben is a mess
put mason in
bench ben
how the god damn was this team undefeated
what a fucking joke
are we really about to get blown out by the bengals
ok guys i played wrrbdb in middle school im stepping in
where was going whatwhatwhaaaa
this is a colossal disaster
bench him hes done
he has so much time in the pocket fucking pump fake just once and youll see whos actually open
like clockwork
put in mason at this point this is fucking inexcusable
you have to bench him
ben is horrible tonight
what the fuck
ben might actually be blind holy fuck
did hodges ever play this poorly
ben is fucking done
ben is dogshit
dead team walking
holy fuck words cannot describe
eh cant blame chucks atleast some one cares
oscar pistorious could do better than this
steelers giving up
we are literally falling apart
this has got to be the worst game of his career or close to it no
whos at 2nd qb rudolph
jesus fucking christ what the hell is happening
draft a qb clap clap clap clap clap

draft a qb clap clap clap clap clap
we are in a free fall right now
yikes
i think we have more turnovers than first downs
our mnf record is coming to an end tonight
we look like chicago pissing away a top tier defense because we dont know how to offense
time to bench him
how about we put a qb in
we have 24 yards of offense
ok only explanation i can think of is ben is throwing the game so he can bet against himself this shit is fucked
worst game ive seen from us in the past idk how many years
bench ben lmao
embarrassing
we deserve to lose this game
heads are going to roll at halftime
i mean at this point its just funny
this team should quit because of covid
ok im officially concerned
now the defense is playing like the offense
lmaoooo
lol
pathetic
im going to bed
iamstraightupnothavingagoodtimegif
arent we lucky that ben is coming back next year
and now the defense is saying fuck it
i got nothing i dont see how we win another game this year
bench ben and gut the team
this one may be over smh
painjpg
not suprised lol not mad anymore
sit ben down
this is just silly
so uhhhh this fucking blows
ben should take himselfout
sorry ass excuse of an offense they are out the first round if they dont get their shit together
i think this is about the time i turn off the tv and hope that they turn it around while im spending my time on something else
classic late season implosion
no consequences or focus on this team blame the coaches
3rd string qb 2 win team fuckin hell
we literally need a legendary ben roethlisberger game to come back from down 17 to this 2 win bengals teams how sad
we all want tomlin to tear the team a new asshole but theres honestly only one asshole that needs to be torn
bens arm just looks weak man
first the jets now the bengals are gonna win with all the odds stacked against them in the same week
i want to be upset but they are literally just the better team we are absolutely terrible
holy shit now our defense is taking a massive dump a third string qb doing better i cant help but vent
they gave up
hey look if the offense isnt going to be held accountable and your qb is being rewarded for shit play youd give up too
this downfall is something else this will stick with us for years the team that went 110 and then fell off
i have not touched my terrible towel since bettis fumbled in the 2005 afc playoff game vs the colts i feel like i need to bring it out now thoughts
put rudy or dobbs in please
god ben isnt it right now
season going up in flames
clean house for anyone that has anything to do with the offense this offense is really schruting it
whats worse ben tonight or when all the broncos qb had covid and they had to start a practice squad wr as qb
its time for ben to go
on the plus side if ben really falls off a cliff here at least we know before trying to roll him out at qb1 again next year

ideally we get vintage ben back of course but id rather have certainty that we needed to move on than no commitment either way
alright tomlin hahah that was a funny joke now take the peewee players out of the steelers uniforms theyre getting hurt
i was planning on having like 2 beers tonight and chilling were already well past that thanks to this performance fucking yikes
ben shouldnt even be playing tonight we have a playoff spot and arent getting the 1 seed
283 anybody thats our only hope at this point lol
wonder if ben will play like his job is on the line now or if hell turn it over again
team thought it was going to be a cakewalk against the bungals they prepared harder
this game seems all but done lets just see how bad it can get
ben this game is legit worse than the 5 int jacksonville game in 2017 if you keep putting him in playing like this you might as well wave the white flag
i get it but mason is god awful
how to ruin a good day
this offense cant do anything right holy shit
wheres mike vick man
even diontae is catching balls today
god he throws wild like a rookie
what other team lets it get this bad this is so bad i cant images coach going just keep trying and the team not be 313
guys this is the most incompetent offense i have ever seen it has reached amazing levels of derp we are witnessing historic derp levels
a couple weeks ago we thought ben should be in the comeback player convo and he has completely unraveled i have to think hes hiding an injury this isnt just one game
this is tomlins third straight year of imploding in december
im trying real hard to remind myself that if i had known we would be 112 now at the start of the season that i would have been very happy
ben looks like peyton manning in his final year except we have no run game
this is pitiful we are not a playoff team
im glad dionte caught the ball but god fucking damnit ben stop throwing such shitty passes
lets make it to the 50 yard line
nice diontae risking a big hit to bring that horrible pass in
taunt
this is trash wrapped in garbage
i love how ben is out there directing traffic and then they just run it up the gut lol
i love when someone says thats not just a cliche right after spouting off a huge cliche
youve heard of the sophomore slump this is bens senior slump after he gets used to the 1 sales tax discount hell start dropping bombs again
good lord dude
the bengals are shitting on us every play
why are we still watching this bois
big cuck
this is probably the most crazy unpredictable game i have seen in my life what happened
getting saved by bengals taunts
shouldnt the unsportsmanlike be enforced since its after the play
about to be shut out this half
ben isnt playing well but our receivers arent bad getting separation consistently
what the fuck ben
we gonna do a cycling hit flag on offense flag on defense fumble interception punt
yeah so were getting bounced in the first round for sure barring an absolutely miraculous turnaround its like this isnt even the same team as it was weeks 18
need a new offensive coordinator
you can take burfict out of the bengals but you cant take the burfict out of the bengals
i fell asleep for 20 minutes how many first downs do we have
you think this is randy just being like see what happens when i try to call other plays
ik hilton is really good in run support but can we see sutton a little more
this game plan looks like it was all hinging on connor being available they have no back up plan the defense is exhausted
either we draft trade up for a qb this year or well be bad enough to draft one next year ben aint it anymore
this is making me sick
were making giovanni bernard look like a straight up explosive back with dynamic playmaking ability
just take a knee please
this is fun
its sad that this incredible defense has so rarely got to play with a decent lead ive wanted to see watt in current form being able to pin his ears back but it just hasnt happened for him anywhere near as often as it should
does anyone remember buddy ryan punching the offense coordinator i am waiting for keith butler to throw a punch
will we hear masons music
he fumbled again
why is cincy not calling timeout
please take a knee
ben bench now
jesus just take a knee christ on a cross
tomlin light a fucking fire under their ass stop standing there
fucking old fuck
cowardly soft ass team
bench him already hes done
the bengals have won 2 games out of 13
he ran out of bounds lmao
im curious where this ranks of worst halves for the steelers in the last 20 years
jaylen whyd you run out of bounds
why run out of bounds
he runs out of bounds
ben is bad but this offensive line is horrendous right now
why do you do this to me steelers
dont panic

the guy costing the game
do i wanna watch the second half
can we cancel the season now
fire fictner give rex ryan a call idk

this is far from over but they need to prove themselves right now
this is the teams biggest deficit all year
we need to get the ball downfield more they arent going to take defenders out of the box until we start getting 15 yard gains in the passing game
booger looks like a thumb
does ben practice anymore
booger looking like a goblin
ben looks fucking done this isnt even a top defense holy shit
ben isnt even looking downfield unless he can loft it he is hurt time to pull him i think his left knee is hurting
that was a pathetic first half but i wouldnt put it past the bungals to completely unravel in the second half
cam came to play
on a positive note were playing the bungles in the second half
ben will announce his retirement after we lose in the playoffs guys its just been confirmed
points they just need points please
wtf was that pic of ben
big al is playing poorly too
this oline
claypool
benny snell is a mvp candidate
wow lets go ben thats a comeback throw
finally

god i would not have wanted to be in that locker room at halftime but it seems to have worked
aint that some shit
ok ok this is good
damn nice play claypool
i guess we just needed a big play for a spark
there we fuckin go
3 and out on d would be fucking massive here
all part of the strat ben played so badly he got all of the rest of the steelers to actually pity him and do their jobs
here we go bois change this mentality around now
honestly may have been the biggest reaction ive seen ben have this season
we are gonna score on defense here
now for a pick 6
now thats more like it
lol
dont worry steeler fans the guy im playing in fantasy has started their defense and he needs 20 points it is inevitable that i will lose so get ready for some picks sacks and possibly a touchdown
time for some run stuffs and sacks
they wanted a push off on that what
just do that again 4 more times ben
sweet feed the claypool giant
playing down to competition is never good but at least theyre waking up
we need this ben for the rest of the season

can we call vance the mvp of that drive
john ross is about to come off the bench and make an appearance lol
i have wiped my tears and have a tad of a chub going lets go
tyler palko came out in a ben costume at half time
tj
watt is an animal
hear me out its late december and ben looks lean plus no grizzled beard ive never seen him look like that this late in the season nor have i seen him play this bad coincidence
ah claypool gets the ball thrown to him and he makes a great play its almost like we should have been giving him the ball more these past few weeks but no that would require actual decent play calling
this team is ready
so if ben keeps calling plays the rest of the half and we end up winning is it time to fire fichtner
sutton is a dog
momentum is changing
nice coverage
good d sutton
lets go boys time to drive it down again
well i guess this is about as much as we could ask for so far lets see if they can do something with it
love the no call on the armbar from the tackle it is truly wild how every play the t vs watt will false start and hold
ive had a bad attitude all game but im feeling cautiously optimistic that we can remember we are playing the bengals
ok if were being real for a sec how much further in the hole would we be if burrow was still playing
ive never been more happy to eat crow lets fucking go boys lets get back into this
come on ben dont forget whatever tf you were told at halftime
just get the first down diontae
anyone else bouta buy a purewick for christmas
so we picking up a first round lineman or qb next draft
diontae redemption arc
so do we like connor better or snell at this point guys
snell is hard carrying
what is this some sort of rungame
ben had his contacts in backwards switched them back at halftime
looking great since they got rid of the impostors in the locker room
what uhwhats going on here
wow we executed a running play
i would love to see the advanced stats stuff on bens velocity first vs second half
holy shit were running to the outside wtf i thought there was a rule about that
wait two consecutive rushing first downs where are the stillers
holy shit a big run
finally a run game
ahhh they were just playing 4d chess that first half
those bengals fans behind the cameraman made me laugh way harder than it should have
damn almost
what happened why is the offense popping off now
damn so close
bozgawd for 3
now weve got a game stop em here d
even if it isnt enough to pull out the w in this game its encouraging to see some life in the offense
ok now we need another stop by our defense
lets go lets go lets gooooo
minkah to tie it
defence charging up turnover incoming
i know its against the bengals off all teams but this is actually what they need on offense something to build some confidence on i still dont know where it goes from here but this was a totally different game before the half
quick defensive stop or turnover would be lovely here
jesus berry any reason why the laces were in
billy blanks fucks up tyson in a fight just saying
ben to dj for the td

ben roethlisberger diontae johnson 23yard td
completion probability 354

route type go

air distance 401 yards

time to throw 204 seconds

2ndquickest time to throw of any completion over 40 yards in the air this season


time for defensive td
another three and out for them
we need a splash play
3 straight 3 and out for bengals
claypool deep come on
those batted balls are the scariest thing ever
personally i think ray ray is due to take one to the house he can be explosive
late hit on ben too
what did the ebron injury end up being would be a tough loss already thin at te
weekly batted pass ok thats out of your system ben move along
i think we really miss mike munchak
god i hope hes okay
i feel hope creeping back in
didnt look like a knee issue i think were okay
holy shit more drops than 4 teams lmao
cramp
another missed roughing the passer
fichtner masterclass
our o line is soooooo bad
the hole was there but snell cut it right
yes yes you do come out 3 hours before a football game to catch balls if you consistently drop them lol
minkah please
defense is going to have to get a to
really bad design no one accounted for a lb down the middle
come on defense turnover here lets go
read that guys name as penis well
defense needs a turnover
are you fucking kidding me
our defense is fucking ridiculous bruh
this linebacker position is truly cursed
another ilb down

they have none left
they broke finley damn
come on get a pick defense
ooh avery coulda got called for tha tbut they havent called a single one of those all day so
can we fucking stop getting injured ffs
heyward has to make that play simple as
how many injuries can we sustain on defense
all that momentum wtf is this now
i feel like thats a definite dislocation you see the way his shoulder bent from that sandwich fucking brutal
thats a separated shoulder
whos playing lb rn
put me in coach
finley looks like hes in his 3rd year at hogwarts
now our defense is choking
allen is back already
allen is back in
keep them out of field goal range plz
a strip back would be nice
about to go to bed i dont at all trust this team if they go down by more than 7
right down the field burning clock defense is gassed
defense is gassed again
this is so fucking embarrassing
ughhh
avery williamson is one of the worst tackling lbs ive ever seen
oh yikes well time to blame the defense too ig lol
5m gone already
youd think someone would defend that
they are of no threat to throw yet they just kept giving up the run
okay even as mr we still got this that hurts im nervous now
highsmith fucked up so bad
move over joe burrow its a finley phenomenon in cincinnati tonight imagine being able to stop lamar jackson every game but being fooled by the third string qb on a 2111 team christ
okits officiali hate the fucking muppets
trade for finley
highsmith didnt contain the edge on that one
shame that ben just decided to show up the second half
love our guys but the injuries at ilb are gonna be too much for us to overcome
my cousin is a ravens fan so i know our next conversation will be a painful one
why are there muppets everywhere
such an embarrassment
what a joke 2101 fucking sad
still a lot of time but shit man
im coming back to the game in 20min i stop watching something good will happen
just an awful showing i am just waiting waiting for the inevitable blowout in the wildcard
now that the jets dont have the first pick now we also cant get darnold easilydamnit
any updates on dionya
good coaching for bengals on that drive
2 tds only ties the game its over
you dont deserve to win if you give up 3 turnovers simple as that
down 14 pts in the 4th go with 2 running plays good play calling
when was the last time the steelers completed a pass in the air over 30 yards the lack of the deep threat is killing this team
we are down 14 and run it twice from shotgun
fichtner you are down by 14 points and you run stupid shit plays like that go to hell you miserable twat
defund tik tok
these slant routes are so fucking predictable the corners all see it coming
this anouncers holy shit lol
wear out the defense with running long as we get positive yards thats fine then go over the top
positive here is that snell looks beyond competent
holy fuck thank god diontae is ok
what on earth was that
ben tried to end the game right there

wow
whoopsie
ben baby what is you doin
we lucked out huge there
snell is first ballot hof dont me
chase ran a stop ben threw a go
lmaooooo
we need a slightly mobile qb if ben could just ram to the right to make a play
glad to see diontae back now if we could just find a better rythym
holy shit clearing it out and throwing it to the running back works
hurry the fuck up
our offense is so slow man
believe it or not this isnt lost quite yet i give us a 15 chance of winning here
theyre going too slow
f word inbound
fucking snap it what are you doing
has anyone ever seen ben snap the ball with more than 15 seconds on the play clock
snell runs hard yard after hard yard

snell ok ben i did the hard work just dont

big ben overthrows wr into a near int

big ben oh sorry what were you about to say
2nd and 1 in the red zone lets go empty set
oh my god this oline is so fucking trash everyone needs replaced
this game has showed another aspect of our play that needs addressed we cannot manage the clock properly at all no sense of urgency any other team in this scenario would be no huddle slinging it
hey i know lets run to the outside thats always been so effective for us this year
hurry up
our run blocking is so fucking bad
fuckin go for it
where the fuck is the urgency on this drive holy shit fuck this team
why are we running the ball what the fuckk why why why fuck you fichtner
bailed out
how is third and one so fucking difficult
considering we need to go for it on 4th dont run backwards
had juju literally wide open on that bat down
thanks ref
ahhh yes 3rd and 1 our old nemesis
benny snell football up the guy 4 times in a row
yay d thanks for the flag bungals
snell mvp
oh my god we made a first and goal
we may have gotten saddled with artie burns but at least we can take solace in that jackson sucks too
actually scored on 1st and goal damn
they should not be celebrating that td get to the fng sideline
we ran for a td
steelers are 03 on 3rd and 1

oof
defense now needs to get us a quick stop

that fg kick was way too close for comfort
please defense
please defense lets get this done
plz minkah
is it just me or is our running game much better when ben is under center than in shotgun
hey kids do you guys actually do the shit in these truly commercials
lets fucking go defense
dear mama i can hear you a crying
youre so scared and all alone
hangman is coming down from the gallows
and i dont have very long
he doesnt want to throw man stack this fucking box trust in your guys in the secondary
they took half the remaining time 549to run that last drive hopefully they have an actual 2 min drive in them
do it for derek tj
i have zero faith in stopping them
defense is fucking ass
we need you here d lets go now
credit bernard for that first
this whole game has been who wanted it more
how are they gonba let him get that pathetic
softest game ive seen in a long time
just falling down 4 yards every play
imagine not spotting these guys 17 points
does finley hide the ball better than david fuckin copperfieldits like the defense cant see him with it
im just going to lie to myself and say theyre not going 100 because they are saving up for the playoffs that will at least by me 2 more weeks
so hard to stay positive right now
make a play guys
yessir
minkah yes way to wrap up my guy thats big time
fucking massive from minkah
not celebrating until they turn it over on downs
took them all game to catch on to that
minkah
minkah is a god
need vintage big ben please show up
im not feelin it but ill try
lmao retire ben
all hopes on you now ben make it happen
come on ben dip into your bag here
if we cant pull this off
shoulda caught claypool earlier in the game instead of looking for him now
why isnt gray in at guard
5 guys around claypol
ok
can we challenge that orrrr
spray and pray baby
guess we lose to the bungels
the sad part is that i cannot leave the game early
well that was atrocious
im pretty confused with what happened to vance mcdonalds pass catching ability i get that hes been working on blocking but always seemed to get the job done
fuck ben washington isnt 67
what the hell ben what the hell
well thats all she wrote at least the offense had life in the second half build on it big game sunday season isnt over
ball game boys
oof
god damn al
nice 113
76 on the line gets blown up every play i blame ben for bad decision making but jesus christ this line gives him no room nor time
uhh heh least we already clinched the playoffs
feels bad man
offensive line has been dogshit all season
this team isnt the same i think the no name team destroyed the steelers
blow up the team next 2 focus on not looking like dogshit in the playoffs
onto indianapolis
cmon guys still 12 seconds left plenty of time to get two quick tds and win this
fyan rinley
well maybe ill tune in for the playoffs so i can at least watch us lose to a good team instead of losing to trash
how the actual fuck do you do that
the reason that is true but not that relevant too much self dick sucking when we were undefeated not enough grind

the reason that is relevant but not true big ben is bad and so is the offense

the reason that is relevant and true injuries
wow we suck we wont last long in the playoffs like this
love juju wholesome dude but save the dancing and shit for when were winning
hopefully mods dont ban anyone clowning us here because this is deserved lol
listen juju dancing on the logo is far from the reason were getting embarrassed but if youve ever played a sport in your life you know that shit like that gives your opponent emotional ammunition that is completely avoidable especially after you got punked doing the same thing the week before its selfish bottom line
yall blaming that on juju are retarded thats the equivalent of a suicide pass in hockey man fuck all you bandwagon losers
another missed pi flag
were literally watching ben roethlisbergers career come to a screeching endshame
they watched that shit in new york and was like hmmm yeah thats a clean hit
gonna go 110 to open the season

06 to finish it

maybe the offense should try just running the damn ball more what else do they have to lose
juju dancing on teams logos gonna be a new superstition
why is ben opposed to throwing to claypool hes been wide open all night its like when johnson and ebron are on the field he only has eyes for them its fucking bizarre
fuck i get why the receivers have been dropping passes all the time

every time the ball comes to you from ben youre probably going to die

how can you trust a qb like that
can you imagine how fucked we would be if burrow was playing
maybe if i stare harder into this tabletit will give me receivers an o line and the ability to find open receivers ben r
can ben not throw it past 5 yards or whats the reasoning with the weak playcalling
defense getting gashed by ryan finley lmaooooo
tired of people sticking up for this sorry defensive performance they were on the field for 4 minutes before this drive they just got dominated on they werent fucking gassed theyre soft
seasons over boys first round exit salary cap nightmares incoming
could we uhh forfeit our playoff spot
anyone still on the
coach of the year award for tomlin
3rd straight loss que the apologist and them saying stay calm everything is ok
pros rediscovered the run check down game and routes other than drags in the 2nd half drop issues fixed

cons ben is complete ass randy is complete ass dj was wide open deep on the last 4th 10 and ben didnt even look i feel like hes not even scanning the field just zoning in on what he thinks will be open
the pittsburgh dad episode for this week is going to be the best one ever
what the fuck is this team doing
that had shazier vibes all over it the way he just went limp
was that not a block in the back watt was pushed into the returner
dirty ass block
how does ben go from absolutely carrying us to playing so bad in just a couple weeks
i cant wait to get a new offensive coordinator
nbano one cares
lmao what an embarrassment this team has become over the past 4 weeks
this offense is pure trash id rather watch 911 clips on replay over and over again
how could randy fichtner call the fumble snap play there
ben only trains one day a week and it shows
ya think the matthew stafford thing was legit
these commentators slight touch in the back looks like he got a piece of the facemask there
cant believe im about to say this but if ben cant get his shit together it may be time to bring in the rednosed reindeer or the duck
another december collapse for mike tomlin
might as well forfeit in round 1 if youre gonna play like this this game if it keeps going like it is will end just like the last 2 games where the defense is gassed and we lose because of it

this offense is not even nfl level at this point its complete horse shit
i know the chiefs have had close games but my goodness in the playoffs ar arrowhead i think pitt would get torched
if we lose this fucking game and fitchner is still our oc tomorrow im done with this fucking bullshit till next year
helmet to helmet hit
hmmm lowered his helmet into the head
im a ben supporter but that was a fucking idiotic pass that was a eli manning caliber hospital pass
honestly juju dancing on the logo everyday puts a target on his head lol
bens broken aint seeing shit
lead with head first contact with helmet automatic pf and 15 yards
bens gotta go i love him he has been the qb since i was a teen and learned to love football but he is not helping here
while were shitting on this offense ben really put juju in the position to fail there
what is the problem isnt fichtner but the offensive unit

what if randy has been the dude making magic happen and we all want him gone this makes me shutter
well bad job so far
people on this sub were upset ben wasnt mentioned in the nfl top 10 qbs like 5 weeks ago
this has to be the biggest meltdown by a team in the history of the nfl
eric ebron is down looks like he took a hit to the back
where the fuck is the flag are you serious
ben cannot throw the deep ball hes lying about being hurt
ben is going to get them killed with these passes
ebron and juju gonna have to talk to ben in the locker room
get ben the fuck out of here he is gonna get everyone injured
i wouldnt mind matt stafford next season see what that man can do with an actual team
ben is currently the worst qb in the nfl no question
ben you are a washed up turd fuck you and dont return next year that was entirely your fault
11 losses and youre high stepping out of bounds lmao
first two rounds of the draft qb and rb
this is the worst qb play ive seen in a steelers uniform ever
were 112 and going to lose to a team with four wins in the past two years
i dont want to even be in the playoffs
like the beats and jags before us weve wasted an awesome defense because our offense is absolute shit guys are tired and tired of being put in a position to lose
i mean to be fair the bengals are known as the kc chiefs of ohio
after the dallas baltimore and washington games i had a feeling the steelers would implode and end 115 that seems pretty likely right about now

i dont care about injuries this is fucking embarrassing
tomlin just stands there and does nothing no scheme change no motivation nothing
an hour before next weeks game against the colts tomlin should do a quick press conference and announce the team is forfeiting

it will give the team a much needed bye week in a game they dont have a chance of winning and will piss off the entire team enough that they might actually snap out of this funk

thoughts
bengals burning themselves with penalties a tale as old as time
i hope he told him not to dance on logos
those fouls should not offset they are not fucking equivalent
juju getting a little humble pie tonight
it seems like ben is throwing to his first read a lot tonight but it cant bethat
this is on coaching
at least we get the ball after hal nvm fuck this team
snell should be the only rb the rest of the game
ben is washed
this is so fucking pathetic ben its time to retire it was a nice ride
ben better be changing his diaper at halftime
rb out half the oline out starting te out

starting lbs gone

not surprising
im putting as much effort into the rest of this season as randy fitchner is this season

none
man so much negativity whats my odds at on betting sites right now im dropping 100 on steelers straight up right now and yall gonna see my money winning post in 90 minutes
ben has sucked but he just responded like a hofer
fucking yes thats why you dont bench a qb in the first half of a football game
that was that ab subtle push off there

not a zip throw from roethlisberger but glad to see him put it in front of someone 25 yards down the field
anyone else still skeptic thatll theyll be able to go on another 100 run at this point lmao
thats some excellent coverage right there
how much yall wanna put that tomlin told fitchner to sit down and took over the offensive play calling
god i really wouldve liked a td there
juju redemption drive pls
imagine what mahomes kelce and hill gonna do to our defense when they get tired bc our offense is trash
i cant wait to get blown out by some wildcard team
getting completely out coached
first game where the injuries on defense especially lbs are really showing
dammit they used the wide open whitey nobody expects whitey to do that
wish we had a futurehof qb like ryan finley
clay pool just stopped and watched that ball
lol shock the nfl world i think the jets already did that
lol to all those who asked for rudolph rudolph do not get us within one td
2 runs 9 yardswe couldnt stop an infant from crawling on the floor
looked like 5 guys on claypool there


why is claypool always falling down when the ball is coming in
3 fucking passes like just do one run to give us a chance use the 2 min warning to stop the clock
quadruple coverage that said i did not know you can plow the receiver
this team is retarded
big ben fucking sucks dudes washed up were not going anywhere with him at the helm str8 up
big ben needs to retire
av got killed all fucking night
cant wait for ben to take wednesday off and tomlin to be okay with it our future is fucked with these two and ive always defended ben but not anymore
hockey season starts soon
another first round exit but who cares since we didnt have a losing season
bens taking covid protocol a little too seriously with these 6foot socially distanced throws over receivers heads
this team is a fucking joke
please force ben to retire he had his run and its obviously over we have 11 wins off our defense
too many mistakes in the first want to say we were the better team in the second half but i cant even say that 2 straight losses you expect this team to come out with a fire under their belly but no one really looked like they wanted it tonight lot of soul searching next couple weeks to see how bad we truly want this
imagine an opposing player did that on our logo
im so glad i decided to drink and play scrabble with my wife over watching this game sober me just knew it just knew

i won the scrabble game
ben is actually worse than mason rudolph these last three weeks id put mason out there he literally cant be worse
idk whats going on with ben hes been beyond trash the past couple weeks may be time to sit for a half
lol turning it off happy holidays guys
how the fuck did we win 11 games
is this how it feels to be a browns fan
juju got lit up on a telegraphed pass all these ppl complaining about stop dancing and perform are pathetic
we arent even going to win the division
stop doing tik tok dances on the other teams logo and you wont get rammed
why the hell is everyone mad at juju ben needs to go back to old ben and hold onto the ball longer
can we fire randy fichtner before he ruins this season

this guy is a fucking turd
fuck our offense fuck our playcalling fuck these refs fuck this game im going to watch star wars
just run every single down no matter what and lets see what happens fun social experiment that doesnt kill our wide receivers who are always going to do short routes no matter what because thats all ben can complete now
trip coverage and another suicide pass lmao
i really dont care about the cap hit i think i would have more confidence in this team next year without him we know what he can do and father time has caught up sorry big guy
at least we were 110 with some cool tik tok dances on opponents logos
im glad kevin greene didnt have to watch this shit
but but i was told if i worried about the team looking like shit against a third string ravens qb then im not a real fan
did roethlisberger send an unsolicited dick pick to an old gypsy woman
can we chain a college girl to the goalpost or something for ben
fuck these refs their defense has been manhandling our receivers all night before the ball is there and theyve thrown one flag fucking bullshit our team needs some work but the refs didnt help
dpi on claypool what the fuck
worst 113 team of all time
this line is bad i dont think ben is washed up like some he has been getting hit all those throws down field he is getting hit when he throws the line gets fixed this team is good the d is solid the skill players just the o line is junk but to borrow a line from my friends next year isnt getting better this year

and us having pro bowl lineman shows how bad the pro bowl has become
fuck this team fuck this team fuck this team
they deserve to lose out the rest of the season if the offense keeps playing like this juju too busy making tiktoks when his stats are garbage and ben looking like my drunk uncle at thanksgiving making a fool of himself
i want to punch benjamin in the god damn face but id have to hit his stomach cause his heads so far up his ass
0 17 guys

bengals winning

this is actually happening
who are these announcers they are creaming themselves over the bengals
announcers if anyone can get this turned around at the half its tomlin

me uhhmmm
juju gonna be spinning in his wheelchair on enemy teams logos at this point
retire ben
ben is so ass dude
anyone complaining about a no pi call can stfu bens plan is to force the long ballagain and hope for the refs to bail him out on a 4th and long this mf needs to go
fault for steelers offense

1 johnson

2 run game

3 randy fichtner

4 tommy maddox

5 dog down the street






19 big ben
this is embarrassing but everyone saying fuck this team should go root for another team
how is that not interference
im glad kevin greene didnt have to see this
he chopped his arm early shoulda been pi
the dude voicing kermit sucks ass
welp seen all i need to see imma head out
x200b

derek watt is down on the ground and unresponsive
bomb it to prove we can


under thrown
this team is falling apart
slight touch my butt announcers
is available atrocious
this team has literally turned into the bears from weeks 18
bad news bears on offense and 1985 chicago bears on defense
man put rudy in im not even trying to be a jerk
ben is done i think looks like hes playing preseason games lately
this offense is no worse with rudolph right now
at least we can look forward to some lit til toks after an embarrassing loss to a 2101 team
i knew this franchise was done for when ben brown and bell lost to the bortles jag and they collapsed the season after and it has just been going downhill from there
i see tonight my faith in the passing game will be destroyed too
this offense deserves jack shit our defense is the sole reason were in this place
at what point do you just sit ben and hope some rest does him some good for the playoffs

one seed is dead and winning the division is looking less likely and it doesnt really mean much other than bragging rights anyways since there are no fans in the stadiums
how come other teams get reliable back ups and this team gets mason rudolph
why is benching ben out of the question
get duck hodges back
all those times we didnt try to get a competent qb2 or future qb have really paid off for us
put in rudolph at this point cant be much worse
another brilliant play call by finctner
targeting
so mason rudolph time i cant watch this shit

he was wide open over the middle what the fuck
two things
1 these announcers are really bad
2 is there a targeting head contact rule in the nfl
is that not a dirty hit head to head genuinely not sure the ruling on that
not targeting ok
helmet to helmet no call btw
phillips dropped his helmet and lead with helmet and made contact with runner helmet who dropped helmet also its official by bengals by laws of shazier he now officially the dirtiest player in the nfl
just kneel the ball itll give our defense more rest
good thing burrow is out
worst 112 team in history
yeah im pretty sure weve lost this one
why do we always play down to our opponents
were a joke and we deserve the heat we catch on twitter lol
what a fucking embarrassment
lol driving the ball its been 2 plays
why they gotta do ben like that slowly zooming into his face right before that touchdown
man i wish i could be there to boo them
lmao we have 2 yards of offense
this is the most pathetic thing ive ever seen in sports jets beating the rams was bad but jets can actually play well at times and darnold is a decent qb this is ryan finley and one of the leagues worse run games
made the mistake of staying up till 2am in london for this dross im going to bed peeps wake me up when ben and fichtner are canned
hey finley has a 100 rating jsyk
no flag wtf
fucking dpi
that has got to be pi lmao what the fuck
ben is just killing the receivers
that contact looked early to me
he got tackled before the ball even got there are there any refs from pittsburgh
fuck you ben
lmao theres a fucking bounty out
these refs are bullshit
i usually dont comment on game day threads but this officiating is absolutely fucking brutal its infuriating to watch missed block in the back on watts injury missed helmet to helmet on jujus fumble and now that
worst read ive ever seen from a veteran qb
time for mason yet
absolutely bench ben immediately
oh my fucking god ben is done
ben is trash if hes still in the game next drive im out
ever since the second half of the titans game this team has not been right
they score its about done
welp thats it for tonight goodnight yall
those who said it earlier were overreacting but seriously sit ben at this point
worth the 15 yards there dont let them high step on us like that gotta stand up for ourselves
ben 2 yards lollllll dont your dareee blame juju or any receiver he already got our te hurt and almost juju
has ben completed anything over 5 yards
ben is burnt toast man
bens stat line
whats tommy maddox up to these days
without a bye this was bound to happen just didnt expect it to be this bad
im really wondering if all these put mason in folks watched a single minute of steeler football last season
guess it shows how much the steelers respect kevin greene hell they dedicated this game to his memory he would spit in every one of their eyes right now
ravens covid curse destroyed this season
ben is literally out there living out a fantasy that hes tom brady and its going about as well as youd expect
i mean that was a lucky but weak personal foul call there
prediction offense gets the ball back ben throws a pick to end the half mason time in the 2nd half
blame tom brady all these dinosaurs think if he can do it they can do it rivers big ben and brees are going to get themselves killed and ruin the next two years for their teams because they wont retire
ben needs to be brought behind the barn
omg run out of bound this is all over on coaching
maybe dobbs has been suiting up this whole time and thats why ben has been playing
the pass game doesnt look good but do you seriously think the run looks better
literally everything the offense does is a dumpster fire fire them all
its not over
praying thats the end of the jaylen samuels experience in pittsburgh
im not very hopeful as good of a coach as tomlin is he has never been good at making halftime adjustments
everyone saying they are frauds and honestly it looks like that is the case
ok i switched jerseys to my big ben bumblebee we should be good for 250yards and 3 tds in the second half my bad for wearing a defensive jersey first half
they benched ben
if our first two rounds arent oline idk what the fuck were doing this oline is beyond horrendous holy shit let al walk cut pouncey restructure decastro too start banner and dotson and draft a left tackle and center trade up for an ot i dont care no qb can succeed behind tissue paper
man are the bengals going to feel stupid losing 2117
ben honestly just looks washed even standing on the sideline
here we go time for vintage ben
1100 times that works and hell keep that dumb lucky screen in the playbook
where the fuck was that the first half
that ought settle down steeler nation heard that or still want rudolph
i legit went upstairs to play madden because this game wasnt going well and i see this shit
chiefs are next boys here comes 7
that finley dude sucks glad we have ben
my eyes burn so bad all of a sudden maybe i sacrificed my vision for this game
thats how you get up in a motherfuckers shit
we really are a fickle bunch arent we
we dont celebrate division titles we celebrated sb trophies
my main man ray ray mcdonald making em look stupid with the jukes
anyone have james harrisons number
edmunds go in ilb
should we forfeit our playoff game
these announcers are fucking awful
the offense gets moving and now the d looks like ass son of a bitch
defense is gassed
number 1 defense
the defense checked out but i dont fucking blame them for a second theyre probably gassed
they wont win again this year
three straight fucking losses after going 110 yep sounds like tomlin december football
holy shit big ben looks bad that was an int
a little urgency would be nice seeing as we need to more than double our points
why do we keep throwing on 1 yard fucking plays wtf
couldve saved 2 minutes on this drive without the down tempo bullshit and useless runs
wait what what the fuck is the strategy behind going for 2 when youre down 8
someone take jujus phone away from him before the next game
ok the defense got some rest if they cant make a stop here then we dont deserve literally anything
theyre just falling forward and getting 4 yards come on defense you know theyre going to run it
thought for sure minkah was gonna whiff on that
lol we suck
that was just a good play from the cb
i think its safe to say we dont get this
an overthrow by ben is the perfect play for this one to end
fire everyone lol good night
ben seriously fucking sucks
this is a bad football team folks
we probably arent winning another game
we should just withdraw from the playoffs at this point
not a single god damn fucking positive
im high as shit rn
this is the night we were supposed to secure the north going to bed pissed
romo is announcing the steelers game next week
pi missed call or not it should never come down to something like this

pit deff bouncing out 1st playoff game
113 95 its the same thing at this point anyone whose realistic is seeing this team isnt capable of making a run in its current state
the real question is will the steelers win another game this season
i was all on jujus side with the dancing bullshit but i think thats enough now win something and then dance
these announcers and refs are so blatantly anti steelers its ridiculous like i get that they deserve
some flame but come on
that was pi no
if this was the chiefs were down 280
what pisses me off is ben walking around like nothing is his fault no reviewing tape on the sidelines no practicing throws no talking with receivers nothing just a pampered entitled diva
hmmmmm the bengals defense seems to be playing extra motivation and energy and all of it seems to be projected at one of our particular players

but im sure people are just overreacting to the dancing pre game by juju
rudolf could play better than this change my mind
honestly never seen a collapse of a team like this holy shit
future jacksonville jaguar tiktok boy needs to stop dancing


big ben needs to stop bluffing and retire


fichtner needs to get fired
well that was a gift from the refs
now this is the kind of game im used to as a lifelong steelers fan
i really hate the negativity of this sub sometimes
defend that ben fans
can someone please tell me why we signed ben to an extension
idc how much i get downvoted but ben stinks needs to retire short throws arent gonna cut it teams figured it out and its exposing that ben doenst have it anymore not to mention most of our receivers are trash and cant catch and we dont have a run game been saying this since week 5 and yall downvoted me calling me a fake fan and negative when in reality i was speaking the truth
everyone needs to chill lol
serious question at what point do we put mason in
fuck it put duck in our offense was actually better last year
not sure if ben is injured and hiding it or he just doesnt have it anymore either way him being 38 and us having a great defense we need to find a qb if ben cant get it done for 2021 and beyond ben is the best qb steelers have had but his time may be done
hit him before the ball was even close wtf
bens just trying to injure all of our receivers huh
why does ben hate claypool
how is that not a penalty
if this is ben from here on out please do not come back just retire
okarafor did exactly what you should
okorafor had every right to do that shit man we need to light them the fuck up
hello doom and gloom fans

requesting for a ticket on the doom train

sincerely a positive fan
yeah im out on this team it was a good run but were losing by 50 to whoever we play in the wildcard round
fire all the coaches cut every single offensive player who ever played a snap
tomlin is still an a coach maybe the best in the league why do these coordinators just suck year after year
man i saw bell turn a 6 yard loss into a 3 yard gain the other day vs the saints meanwhile no one on this team has shown up

he was right bens a problem
minkah got beat bad there

got lucky
great job ben but its still fuck you ben
fuck man ray ray is scared to catch these punts losing yards letting it bounce
overunder on a ben int to end the game
claypool fucking mugged
this game is on ben
not once has this team been dominant the past 10 years we have never looked like the chiefs we have never looked like the ravens last year
how are there still tomlin haters
i crave the sweet release of death please
pittsburgh dad is gonna have a good video about this game
dont think this team beats the browns in week 17
ben doesnt even look like he wants to be here honestly blaming everyone else
lions fan here love the optimism
that was pi
how are we possibly blaming tomlin i thought we moved past that
yall can fuck off hating on juju for his tiktoks because hes only having fun and it doesnt impact his game
whos starting at guard seen dotson is out and feiler on ir
im predicting a 203 scoreline tonight a defensive td diontae and juju for the 3 tds and 1 missed pat by boz
derwin gray starting at left guard based on what ive heard about derwin it sounds like we shouldnt expect to run the ball much better
i hope the muppets become the regular mnf crew
fucking really nfl
im down by 42 pts in my fantasy semifinal and i have ben boz and the dhoping for a miracle
i expect the steelers to win and the bengals to somehow cover
lets have a whole game commentated like that
if they come out with the same throwshortrunlong dinkanddunk offense i dont care what the final score is i will be very frustrated youve stacked wins get your process in order for when it counts
for those who have a redditstream subscription the link is here
claypool is a beast
why the fuck is this on espn

edit apparently this has been normal this year and i just didnt know it but i still feel like if you live in central pa it should be on a local channel
mute
shove these muppets in your pie holes
muppets its time to cheer
ray ray learned from last week it seems
wtf wtf wtf
a playaction pass ill take it
its too early to do this to my heart
washington had a step but unfortunately it was underthrown
good kneeldown ray ray love it thank you
hey i respect pushing the ball down the field

horrible underthrow but still good to see
toothless run game fucking hell man
gross throw
was the intent to have us lose confidence in bens long passing skills
so what in fucks name was that muppet thing
how did anyone on our oline make the pro bowl
cant even get a first against the shit bengals huh
can you throw more than 40 yards ben
ben has aged 10 years in the last few weeks
impotent
we got away with 2 that should have been picked there
nice first series way to go dip shits
sighderek
that looked bad i hope derek is ok
pls no
oh god that doesnt look good
throwing past the sticks never heard of her
oh no

holy fuck ouch
oh fuck

well this game was ruined real quick hope derek is ok jesus
thats why you dont fucking push people in the back fucking idiots cant help themselves
dereks up
pain neverending pain
i fucking hate how they cut away for commercial when a dude has a serious injury like that and looks lifelessat least get to the point where we can see it he has some life in him
textbook concussion
we have one of the best defensive lines in the league and the bengals have one of the worst offensive lines how did gio bernard get so much yardage on that run
lets try out that new running game
one pa and now back to the regular playbook lmao
ah he had him too
wow our offense is so fucking trash lmao
ben please
ben throwing short
this offense can be summarized as spain without the s
wobblers
just end the season
this offense has no momentum building just all huck it and fuck it
youre supposed to do play action after running the ball
our running game is terrible
boy we looking fucking bad
are we not even gonna try to run the ball
lets see completely impotent offense an injury and good defense early

looking pretty familiar
do you think a possible reason to us not being able to run the ball is because we always run out of shotgun formation
run the mother fucking ball fuck you randy
ben is not looking good rn need to get it together quick
our offense leaves a lot to be desired
4 punts in 5 minutes
whats the line on a 00 tie
all those weeks where ben was saying he needs to throw more accurate ballsdude put a curse on himself
announcers throwing shade


will we see our first first down here
has a game ever maxed out the tv timeouts
the whole team got the yips
youve gotta be kidding me
oh my fucking god
jesus fucking christ
ben wtffff
at least it wasnt 3 and out
this is fucking laughable
i dont even know what to say rn
tomlining
yeah lets pack it up we aint beating the chiefs anyway
if this is the team that limps into the playoffs it will be an early exit smdh
holy shit theyre terrible
this is real steeler football
what the fuck
just when you think this offense cant be more pathetic
this is ugly
brilliant good job
lol that santa beard definitely doesnt qualify as a mask and fumble oh fuck me
its like they dont even want to play football anymore
guys wtf just happened
we are absolutely terrible
just kill me now
god this team is depressing we need a new qb next year
wtf is this shit
this is fucking pathetic
tank for trask
worst offense in the league no doubt
excuse me while i simply pass away
so much for making routine plays routinely
6 minutes in and it feels like an eternity already
this is embarrassing
okay we were all ready for a 3 and out but you have just found a new way to let us down
we fucking suck cock
jesus christ what a fumble
how how the defense not pulled aside the offense and beat the shit outta them
solid hit by hayden
shit spot
what is that spot lmao
this is hard to watch
grossly disappointed
huge
alex highsmith is looking like an amazing looked good before but i think he had a lot of upside
this offense looks no better than last year at this point need to get their shit together before the playoffs or it will be an early exit
was that a sack
how does espn have such shitty announcers as such a big company
what do you guys think our longest run of the day will be
nice a completion
this feels like madden i much prefer defense
i know were going to turn the corner in this game but right now this is painful to watch
i would rather watch the offense last season and thats saying something
this is embarrassingly bad holy fuck
sometimes you have to laugh to keep from crying
our offense is dreadful 3 punts and a turnover already
oh look a terrible pass
we look like fucking clowns fuck this our whole offensive coaching staff needs fired the calls the offensive line schemes the drops the running backs not hitting holes the whole staff needs fired
another short ball
wow this is sad getting to a point we kind as well put rudolph in lol
for real though can somebody explain why our play all is so generic without using the words randy or fichtner
peyton manning in his last season had a cannon compared to big ben this year
what is going on
3 and out 3 and out fumble 3 and out
are we sure thats ben and not rudolph
three and out 16 of the last 30 drives lmao
what in the living fuck has happened to this team
honestly 4 possessions with 0 first downs and the least yards to go as 7 is impressively bad
my madden offense is in this video and i do not like it
bens passes just look soft floaty
diontae needed to come back to that ball wtf
both duck and mason played better than this jesus christ
jordan berry once again our offensive mvp
wtf is wrong with ben
wish they fell apart earlier in the year couldve used the better draft pick
i ambeside myself
the d will need to score
glad we took that timeout to draw up that near interception kill me
maybe finley can give ben some tips
we look unironically awful
i would rather have ryan finley than ben right now
you guys forget we dont get things rolling until the early in the 2nd qtr
this offense would have thousands of upvotes on rjokes
looking at this team now i genuinely can not believe there was a time i thought this team could actually keep up with the chiefs lol
we are succin a fat d tonight
can we trade for finley
ben said hes coming back in 2021
2101 with a back qb
lets get a defensive td right here boys
yeah we need to improve a lot or thats a first round exit
ryan finnely is playing better than ben rothlesberger
if we keep doing these quick ass 3 and outs the defense is gonna be out of steam by the end of the 3rd quarter
look guys an actual throw
they just snoked us on 4 verts embarrassing
our offense is sooooo bad
this is the worst offense i have seen
right tackle jumped
im about to turn this off man i cant watch this
haden is such a baller
finley with these weapons
ugh guys this sucks
itd be great if we had a josh dobbs right about now
ryan finley wasnt even good enough to start at boise state over brett rypien and we are gonna do everything we can to get him a win arent we
we need ben to step up we go as he goes he still has it in him i believe but hes got it find it again
the next 2 week are going to be embarrassing vs the colts and browns
wheres the creativity on offense its the same ole lame 3 and out but lets be honest we all knew steelers would start like this
good sense by hilton on that play
hes no younghoe koo
what a waste of this amazing defense theyre so god damn good but our offense looks like a jv team
just punt when we get the ball so our d has longer to try and score
will starting with good field position even matter at this point
im going to need more beer for this one
oh wow bengals want us to win okay cool
at what point does the offense start yelling at the offense i know it is team but at some point you have to say something
the defense needs to just sit on the snap next time the offense only gets them a 4 minute rest
lmaooooo what the fuck is ben doing
that was such a dumb call
hell yeah best field position
who would have thought our best field position so far would be because of the opposing teams offense
lmfaoooo our defense has given us the best field position
ok cmon o shake it off and get right
alright whatareyahavin

weve got 3 and out

a more filling 4 and out

a tipped pick

or the rarer drop drop drop punt
ben should have 4 interceptions at this point
wtf is this quack times
ben has thrown more catchable balls to bengals players tonight
ben blasted the teams toughness then cant complete a pass
if bens hurt theres no reason why dobbs shouldnt start next game

dobbs isnt great but neither is jalen hurts its all about the gameplan
almost intercepted again wtf
bro
this is pretty sad so far
lol ben should have 2 picks already
that should have been bens third interception of the night something is wrong in his head
we really boutta do play action if we arent running
remember when drops were our biggest problem
punt on 2nd down we can finally move the ball down the field
ben has 2 yards lol
big ben is playing qb like he is on my madden team god fucking awful
cover 1 tight man coverage they do not respect our deep ball at all and we havent given them a reason to either
absolutely massive gain
is this our fourth 3rd and 7
go downfield moronjfc
wtf
lol
pathetic offense
horse shit calls by ben
bench yourself
fuck dude
now ben is trying to kill people
we have nothing on offense anymore
holy fuck steelers what the fuck are you doing
poor juju i know hes gonna hate seeing that replay
juju just got destroyed
fucking screens no running game wtf
do we see if masons got anything
so who do people want this offseason a drafted qb or like darnoldhaskinsminshew type
ii just dont know
head to head hit
lol what was that 2 yard pass gonna do ben is lost
juju still needed to be 5 more yards down field anyway
thats a fumble
offense looks anemic right now
why are we not even running our 3rd down plays to the marker
number 11 was wide open the fuck
bench ben fucking pathetic
ben has aged like absolute milk this season
rudolph time
cool lets try to kill juju
mark madden is tumescent right now
jujus head almost fell off
claypool was wide open
claypool was wide open down the middle
shouldnt that have been a flag lol uhhh
this team doesnt deserve fucking shit
i am in so much pain
so im thinking we play defense on both sides
demoralized this offense was built on paper legs the whole time
bengals playing like its their super bowl steelers look like they cant be bothered what is going on with these guys
hit to the helmet
what do you think has been going on at practice how does our offense practice against our defense
thats all folks
steve levy needs to go play in traffic
this fucking offense is trash tier delight they have no clue what to do and not one leader among them i am amazed we won any games this year because watching these last three has been beyond brutal mike tomlin still playing the role of cheerleader but it definitely was masked by top tier defense
what is an offense also leading with helmet but okay lol
ben is cooked
these announces suck
i thought you cant challenge a play ruled dead like that
ben is looking like ass out there
put in rudolph
not only is our offensive game plan terrible its actually dangerous these receivers are getting teed up and are gonna get hurt
ben is playing with no confidence
im just crying at this point
why am i watching the same offense from 3 weeks ago
juju please make a tik tok once the games over
so can these cunts review it for targeting since the bengals are challenging this is absolutely fucking ridiculous
may wanna leave that highlight off tik tok juju
plot twist ben was actually aiming for claypool
no way lmfao
this is all because our offense is 1 dimensional theyre defense already knows whats coming
fuck this offense the d is gonna be dead by halftime
literally doing the same shit as the last two weeks abandon the run start throwing a bunch of short passes so they can just crowd the line and disrupt everything

why the fuck would it work out any differently tonight blow this whole thing up
look its obviously one quarter of football but im thinking about this tweet from last night and right now i feel like the answer is zero
we need a pick six or this is over
most of our injuries have been on the defensive side so likewtf happened with the offense how did we win 11 games
where is tomlin getting pissed at juju why does tomlin get a pass when they are winning but when it goes to guys heads hes no where to be seen
we had two yards of fucking offense
it would likely be 00 if we punted on 1st down our offense is playing that bad i truly cant believe my eyes
look ben i know youre not getting any younger but you need to sit in the pocket just a little longer and not rely on these underneath crossing routes
ben has an absolute noodle of an arm now no reason he should be throwing under 5 yards every play if something is wrong
i mean surely tomlin has to see where the issue is right i mean its been painfully obvious these last three games
i have big news its possible to play defense and offense at the same time
maybe we should look into taking a star qb like finley
ryan fucking finley is outplaying you just fuck off and retire
hey guys i dont think our defense knows the qb can keep the ball
unfortunately get ready for the defense to get picked apart second quarter just started and the defense has already played a full game
this offense is fucking ridiculous we have no run game and bens touch is nonexistent then when he does make a decent pass stone hands receivers drop it
anyone know what happened to greene way too young
while our offense is bad i really enjoy how well our d plays even with how hurt they are
so much pain
lol shredded by something called finley
finleys gonna get hurt with that let the kid throw

offense needs to show some life
what did we do to deserve this
well time to drink
wipe that awwshucks smile off finley tj
imploding
alright guys its officially time to panic
did we really have to go 100 like was it necessary
weve had three weeks to adjust our gameplay
now come out and play pissed off man this is so disrespectful and embarrassing we were 110 why are we playing like this
at this rate hopefully we go 3 and out so we cant give them field position
i feel like we arent going to blow them out would love for ben to prove me wrong here but dayum we cant move the ball for shit
i took my jersey off boys maybe thatll help idk this is fucked
literally collapsed so hard i dont understand how this happened
cincy is making this look easy for this themselves so far
okay steelers come the fuck on hoping this helps
the timing of rowthlisbergers i want to play next year now has me a little nervous makes me think he knows his arm is cooked for the rest of this year and he wants one more run so he doesnt go out like this
this is really bad lol
pain sadness despair
depending on how the rest of this game goes it might be time for ben to seriously consider retiring if not the front office is gonna have a hard decision to make because it might seriously be time
hopefully our loss will prevent the bengals from getting sewell silver linings
the colts are going destroy us
good return by ray ray but what the fuck was that camera angle
why do you think our offense has regressed so much like theres gotta be a reason
where are the muppets
juju has completely shot his young energy goodwill
we have 4 total yards
dont forget that before our first two losses at least 3 other games we had no right to win remember haden bailing us out 2 games in a row with batteddown pass in the endzone with no time on the clock remember the missed field goal to give us a win
maybe 3 yards and a cloud of dust football is actually our best offense
watch

they wont be able to get the 1 yard
now thats how you use motion to establish the run
look running the ball kinda works
so what youre saying is they havent played this bad on offense since chuck noll
lmao 3rd n 1 short
lololol
i mean of all the problems weve shown over the last 3 weeks clearly dancing pregame is the biggest if hed stop im sure the terrible qb cbs and rbs would be better
holy shit 5 yard run
the oline is really bad
please go for it
gotta go

horrible spot
snell smelled the first down said nahhh not today
now this is the team ive expected since week 4 smfh
its 3rd and 1 what do you want to do

lets go into the most obvious set possible and run it up the middle
lmao still no first downs
go for it
we are running the fucking football
decastro gets destroyed pulling but snell running right into his ass is too funny
decastro stood straight up at the snap zero push
as soon as we were short i said snell up the middle and hell be short
holy fuck benny you suck
he got it on that dive
the offense is completely onedimensional and predictable and that starts at the o line regressing so heavily we cant run block and we have to offload the ball quickly to help pass protection

im sure the org has a better idea internally on what exactly the problem is there but either we need to make big changes on the line or sarrett needs to be gone or both maybe fichtner too but definitely the line
motherfucker
1 yard run them to death thats the spirit
imagine pretending to be a physical team when you cant even run a qb sneak
shit spots both time but he didnt get it
cant get a yard you dont deserve to win
that should be a flag
great stone hands ebron is hurt now
wow thats not a flag
no flag
no pi
that was so fucking early
triple coverage wtf
oh no
chuks is a fucking terrible
how do we even fix this offense you cant draft 5 olinemen in one year feels like were seriously wasting this defense
dale lolley

dlolleypgh
ebron is up and walking off looks like he took a shot to the back
claypool was too far down the field ben knew he couldnt hit him
first juju now ebron bens killing hit targets

this is not injury at least doesnt seem like it
whooooo weee mr mcgeee this looks bleak
why the fuck are we going to pay ben 41 million next year to do this shit
oh theyll call us for a false start
time to go to bed isnt it
pouncey and decastro got some push on that rush everyone else was still at the los
ben is scared to get hit
thats the best run ive seen in weeks
best run of the season
thank god they figured out that running the ball actually is an option
great call there
they just cant do anything right
that was a stupid play call
its the same plays over and over
where the fuck is vance going there lol runs past lawson
and there it is
lol
we need more bubble screens
yikes
nah yeah take him out
roethlisberger interceptiongeeez louise
only time ben will give it to claypool
so ben is benched now yes
meltdown
i feel like weve tried that so many times with claypool and its never worked
these sweeps are predictable and stupid
ben has to be benched now
wheres duck
dobbs plz
why did i turn the game on
well who would have seen that coming
im glad we managed to get an unsportsmanlike or personal foul
its over
this is like a game of madden and the bengals game mode is set to easy lol
pain
does ben not have eyes at all
bengals were waiting for this one and naturally ben delivered
embarrassing
lmao what in the fuck
lol cant wait to watch this all next year as well
this offense is a meme lol
pull ben i dont know what the fuck is going on
they deserve everything thats coming to them wake the fuck up
what a sorry ass offense just pitiful
keep forcing the throws ben you asshole
this game is over btwthe visible frustration on the steelers is a death nail and theres no burfict to fuck it up for the bengles
so what is dobbs doing right now
bench him now
ben what the fuck
member when i got downvoted in the first quarter for saying to bench ben i member
put in mason
rudolph should start the 2nd half
lmao
he can keep going for all the ben supporters how many will it be
dude this team is done
terrible jet sweep call hasnt worked in 2 months then ben doing ben things gotta be better
get duck in there
best case scenario down 13 at the half
retire ben
he was itching to throw an int
getting clowned by clowns
goodnight sweet prince
well at least i wont have to take time of work for the playoffs
hope we keep ben next season hes a hof
so you think that getting destroyed by a 2 win team will light the fire
we were running well with benny snell and do some stupid jet sweep wtf why do it till they stop it
our defense is the new offense
alright bench ben please

i think mason could spot us 1017 points
life is pain
rudolph time
they will never bench ben unless if its garbage time and were leading keep riding with him until we lose it all
wish i was at the stadium so i could boo
im an utterly insane i still believe in us
rudolph or dobbs
absolute nightmare
welp time to play crusader kings 3 this game is beat
alright im accepting that im bad luck i turn on the game 2 minutes later ben throws an interception and bengals get a touchdown time to turn it off
id be pissed if i were on the defense
damn it must be tough rn for the offense thats crazy bengals are killing us
the unraveling of this team is uncanny
offense about to light it up

offensedefense both look like shit right now
pain
this is fucking disgraceful
if carolina isnt gonna use pj walker can we have him

i havent seen a beatin like this since somebody stuck a banana in my pants and turned a monkey loose
when does the game start
3 and out
i just dont understand how the steelers have declined this much
in frustration i said they steelers wouldnt win another game after the loss to wft now im going to contemplate suicide because i guess i was right
im glad my pregame drink is peptobismol helps me stomach this garbage im watching
just have ben launch 3 bombs and punt see what happens who the fuck cares at this point
just wow ben is done
they need to at least try to go deep bengals have their whole defense 15 yards from the line of scrimmage theres no window for any of the crossing routes
pain
i never thought i would say this but they need to bring mason in
ita not ovee bur we need to put points up
rudy rudy rudy rudy
its worse that its finley id be fine if it was joe but mf finley
steelers one and done in the playoffs
43 yards 2 touchdown wtf
even tho johsnon caught that wtf was that pass
got to see my irish get blown out a couple of days ago and now this
if they didnt put mason in after that dreadful interception i dont see it happening at all
another bad throw behind the receiver
i think this is the first game maybe ever that i legit feel like throwing up from
hopefully this speeds up some much needed firings at least probably not though
is ben trying to kill his receivers
lmao how the fuck did this team win 11 games
bens cooked
diontae looking good again
the muppets probably have a better chance to score a touchdown than our offense does put them in mike
the folks that said ben is going to get someone killed are right high and over the middle asking for a disaster
lmaoooooo
ben is finally at positive yardage
lol at the taunting call
of course its offsetting
its a christmas miracle we get to throw the ball again
what a moron
we could have infinite opportunities and still we would not win
holy fuck the refs called a penalty
unsportsmanlike conduct the bengals still might just pull a burfict here
ugh
and we throw the chance away
yikes
if ben stays in hell have at least 1 more pic tonight
is ben going to give us permission to panic now
jesus fucking christ
we suck lol
same plays over and over and over
i think we all know where the ball is going before the play starts
no turnover so progress
how much longer is ben under contract for again
the best play we had all night was okafor late hitting someone shoulda hit him harder then high stepped
it has to happen a lot for me to beg for mason but its time
pic 6 right here
is ben trying to imitate brady again because i think he forgot once again that hes not brady context brady had a 2nd half comeback vs atlanta
teams arent even afraid of the intermediate pass brees is proof you can be great 20 yards in but it is impossible to be great 10 yards in
looks like a team that should be tanking for trevor
our defense needs to make a play for us because our offense sure as shit cant it really tells you something when we wont even take timeouts to try and stop the clock before the half and at least fucking try
rudolph better take the field
has ben ever been benched
atta boy nelson
bengals will still get the ball back with time
lmao can you imagine if we played the jets this year
i wish the defense just let the bengals stay on the field i cant watch another possession i cant
if we give up here like last week lmao
get this man out of the field
who wants to take bets on what this next offensive drive looks like
just take it to the half this is pathetic
omgggg ben so trashy tonight
when it rains it pours
78 is terrible
just let someone else take a shot
jfc take a knee
bahabahaaaaahhah
fucking clowns
i cant believe were running the clock out to go into halftime just complete chicken shit
this idiot ran out of bounds
im not even capping when i say this has been the worse half of offensive foot ever from the steelers
im glad the bengals called timeout

i hate how lazy nfl teams are with end of half possessions no dont kneel it or run out the clock try to score especially teams that are losing and not getting the ball after the half
this is just sad not even mad just completely sad
mike tomlin has sayings but adjustments what are those
good job going out of bounds there samuels
why run out you fucking moron end this shit show
ben looks depressed
did berry make the pro bowl
he went out of bounds lol why not
tank for trask or that byu qb that guy one of them should be available when we pick right
might just say fuck it and watch old episodes of the real world to end my night
does jaylen have any situational awareness
and bengals receive kick off gawd
pain
woof this is a tough one
need a 3 n out and td to start the half anything less is unsatisfactory
i was going to say second last because of nfc east but then realized we lost to washington so probably worst team in playoffs
i think the new grinch musical is better than this shit
to be fair zac taylor is an offensive genius
somehow ive been more critical tonight than statler and waldorf
what is happening
picked a bad year to buy my family new steelers gear for xmas well i thought it was a no brainer back when i bought it
i didnt know the score or anything about the game until now and all i can say iswhat the actual fuck thanks for ruining my dayagain
you need a turnover and a short field to even give the offense a chance
honestly though i cant be the only one who expected this to happen right like i get were 112 but weve kinda sucked in a lot of games all year we just won and the last several games speak for themselves regarding the quality of play
bensteelers are playin possum will wait until playoffs to unleash new offense
235 for steelers win right now pretty weak for being down 17 if it gets to 400 with 10 min left in 3rd might pull the trigger

edit fuck meshoulda pulled it at 235
lets get a pick 6
did they really bench ben
ben looks like hes gonna piss himself
whats the overunder on a threeandout coming up
good job dnow offense lets rebound
i havent been able to use my towel tonight pain
my stream is as garbage as this game
the offense owes it to the defense to put some points on the board already
what why is ben in noooo
ben not benched
ben feeling dangerous
big al is getting worked
fuck al having an awful game
never mind the rudolphlution has been delayed
maybe ben and his wife are in a fight
av is getting fucking killed every play
i genuinely cant give you a reason why hes still in
in last 7 halfs of football the offense has scored 44 points that isbarely a td to think they are going to score 24 is laughable
you have to pull him wrf was that throw
big al playing like booty
snell is swell
oh yeah chase claypool is on this team
just give it to chase from now on ok
please just give me one solid throw to claypool at least let me save my fantasy team this week
clay chasepool
feed mapletron
chase padding bens passing numbers
claypool needs to be that spark
chase is electric sometimes
this what we need
get angry lets go
omfg
thank god for chase claypool
there we go boys
finally
who are these imposters
wow just like that you are back in it
nice ill take it but keep consistency going n no 3 n outs
there ya go
lets fucking go oh thank god
that throw was astounding
thank god i needed that
here we fucking go
yep were definitely winning this game
good thing they benched ben
what a ball from ben there
lets goooooo ben actually looked decent there thats what im talking about
is juju still in
hoorayyyy
lets not forget that you can save 15 or more by switching to geico
we got angry ben now this should be good
i threw out my arm celebrating that
steelers needed that its time they heck up
just like that
was it really that fucking hard jesus felt more like cincy gave up on that drive though honestly
one play thats all it takes

moreplease
fuck why cant we do that atleast a couple times in the first half
no quit
fire randy the deep ball was probably bens idea
being an indians fan terry francona often says it isnt who scores first it is who scores next lets score next
a turnover would be siiiiiick
it may be a happy festivus afterall
now im kinda glad claypool didnt score there
we need some minkah magic
910 times we bitxh about the wr screen pass it worked that time and now were all like wtf why dont we do that
im just glad my man in here won his fantasy game only needing 3 points out of ben that shit would have made me quit fantasy forever if it held up
bruh im feeling a tj forced fumble
defense pick us up now
need a turnover here lets goooo
aaron donald can pass rush

tj watt can pass rush and stop the run
fire em up tj
tj the tiger king
yeah baby run at tj all night
tj is a grown ass man
announcers throwing shade from 2017 at bengals
i wish tomlin and randy sphincter could explain to me why vance isnt the starting tight end he is a great blocker and he uses his body to make catches ebron is faster surebut his drops and poor blocking make him a liability
great timing sutton
feels like mr momentum may be changing direction
wow sutton made a great play never turning his head he read the wr perfect
its a momentum swing
god i love sutton
lets go
wake up steelers we have to ball out in this second half lets keep this spark burning
as hype as this as making me i cant help but be so confused by why we cant play like this all the time
just need a fg on this possession more screens to 11 and go routes for 18
get the fucking first you fucking dumbass
find the sticks brother
two back 3 and out on defense lets fucking go offense get us some of those points again
dj has got to stop secondguessing himself
i really want to know what tomlin said at halftime because it appears to have worked i do know that im glad that whatever he said wouldnt be directed at me though
oh hes throwing darts now
dear god just get the first down
that was a really favorable spot then a nice catch
if we win this game off of a fg im finally buying that boz jersey
im telling you this is the turnaround of the team
trevor lawrence to the steelers
my bestfriends wife made this for my mom for christmas youll like it if you like mandalorian
benny lets fucking go
i want to see a deep shot
lets go benny football
thats the best run of the year
fucking run game right there
thats benny snell football
this game wow
benny snell
good run blocking long runs who is this team and what have they done with the steelers
what the fuck

x200b

you guys what the fuck is this team
dj is on fire man i love seeing him put in that effort
who is that at left guard
you kind of forget what good coaching can do
diontaes hands look goooooood
tomlin is our coach
wtf i love snell now
good blocking from big al we need more
yes yes yes here we go snell here we fucking go
a different team came out of that locker room this crow is delicious
dj just made an incredible block into selling the pass completely opened up the outside of snell
the standard is the standard
when the fuck did we get a run game
benny snell football baby
benny came to play
so close
dude on video before commercial looks lie fat ben
i will take that
i wouldnt be mad going for it there but points are points defense with another big stop here
this is some sort of divine intervention going on right now
well fuck there goes my 2117 prediction after 3 guess ill have to settle for 2417
would have loved a fake right there
lets score next
lol member that one time we played like we were going to get blown out by the bengals
can tie it up now lets go
lets gooooo
tj looks rocked from tuitts headbutt
this guy just smiles
do we few a sack tonight extend the record
tie it up
if we tie or take the lead the bengals are gonna get chippy as fuck

cant wait
nice run mcfarland
why does ryan finley look like he is smiling all the time
damn they read that one
2nd and 1 run the ball idiots
randy deserves literally no credit
why would you stretch and extend a punt return and risk loosing it for an extra yard

ben must be leading the league in knocked down passes
making some adjustments

more like completely throw out the entire fucking offensive playbook
sneak the bitch
dj playing well and hes injured fucks sake
well fuck
we finally ha e a run game going and we still throwing it on a 2nd1
aw fuckkkk
bens gets off the ground like a 68 year old man lol
good to see him moving i thought that was pop goes the achilles
glad to see dj walk off
so ridiculous
fuuuuuck man
yay another draw play
benny smell
jfc
can we please have just a couple of power runs for old times sake
defense has no excuse here they need to stop
defense needs to take it away
i dont even know what happened there
make a fuckin play
you need to have alualu in there marcus allen just ate a guard cause the guard got a free release
thank god im a penn state fan so im just numb to pain at this point
jesus christ another fucking linebacker
another injury hope he is alright
more lb injuries
thats illegal in at least 5 states with what finley just did
allen had a dislocated shoulder
god dammit
thats it for linebackers nowsoooo now what
whos the next man up
great throw by finley there tbf
pain pain pain pain pain
do we have a lb left
come on man
as long as the offense continues to look alive i dont care if they lose this one so long as there are no more injuries ridiculous amount at ilb
hes back in
fuck the pussycats
defense can not fold now
mans looks conccussed
we need to force a turnover badly
i hate gio bernard feels like he always plays well against us
please
we need a stop
bro fuck me
jesus
they are not going to let finley throw an int or get sackfumbled theyll run 3 times and kick the fg if they dont get a 1st
we need to get a pick or fumble
jeesh allen
are you fucking serious
what the fuck tackle this son of bitch smh
ughhhh
cin going after avery and allen
they are running at marcus allen
thats that
losing to this game manager qb
naive defense
fuck this
unbelievable

back to not making tackles
why are we even playing this game they clearly dont wanna be there
wtf defense
fucking embarrassing downright awful
absolutely pathetic
how did we make adjustments to him running
pathetic
unreal
second coming of vick
jesus fucking christ our run d is fucking aids always have an eye on the qb fucking idiots
what a joke
well bois we already clinched playoffs nothing left to do but just sit back and laugh
why cant our defense and offense ever play well at the same time
theyre a joke right now
where can we get a stud like this finley guy
12 minutes left stay calm
you can pinpoint the moment my heart breaks in half
well that was depressing
dont be disappointed guys ryan finley is the goat passer and runner but we still got this






lol
this offense is way too predictable as well the bengals know theyll only run slants or drag routes and are pressing receivers hard
fucking useless
highsmith getting exposed out here today his size is not going to make him potent as a rusher
we were in no way prepared for this game
the dupree injury is the straw that broke the camels back
how close do we need to be to his face
lmao finley looking like lamar
down 14 better stick them with the running game
if they go 3 and out this thing is ovet

run run pass
down 14 and giving the ball to benny freaking snell
why am i still watching
sense of urgency please
wow what a play call
run it twice in a row down 14 in the 4th what the fuck
good thing were running out the clock
1st half not doing shit on offense and he refuses to run the ball down 14 lets run it
what is this play calling now
who the fuck is calling runs down by 2 tdsthats absolutely inexcusable
get a td here and cincy is due for a turnover
how many more late season collapses before tomlin or the rooneys finally start taking deserved criticism

they cant even beat a team with 2 wins and 10 losses this is beyond pathetic its disgraceful
snell having a better game now
you cant throw that ben
that was beyond lucky oml
bruh
i dont give af how this game goes benny gets the start till he loses it
that wouldve been game over
oh my gawd
what the f ben take him out
what the fuck
that wouldve been the game thank fuck
snell mvp
we got bailed out there
dishing out straight dimes put that ball on a platter
ben is so fucking done
claypool did not know it was thrown his way
next three throws better be in the ez
id love for vance mcdonald to emerge from hibernation at some point
why the fuck hasnt chase claypool got the ball again
so many injuries overall tonight
hurry the fuck up
does it look like ben is babying an injured arm
ben probably not going to be proud of breaking 60k tonight
batted ball 2
empty set on 2nd and 1 of course
juju was open lol
wtf was that
wtf was that play fucking shit
pathetic
the play call off the century
if we dont score in the next like 3 seconds its game over
our line is soft as fuckinn charmin
see you all in january
margus hunt is underrated af but still f that
this is the most predictable playcalling ive ever seen
notice how tomlin is just standing there doing nothing
we can not run the ball to the right
saved by the dpi
are we allergic to running on second down
does ben have the lead in batted down balls
lets goooooo
ball was uncatchable got lucky with the flag
bruh fuck you randy
2nd and 1 is when that play should have been called randy
fucking horrific
a little bit of urgency would have been nice a pathetic effort is the only way to describe this game
jesus fuck that flag saved this game
soooo fortunate for that
offensive line do something
tomlin we have to do better we have to execute
that di might keep this game alive
defense needs to actually tackle this drive
need a big steelers d stand
finally a fucking pi
ok defense fucking get it back
now imagine our d hadnt sleepwalked through that last drive and given up that tack on td
defense got a good rest its time for a big play from tj
maybe load up on the run d
defense is too depleted at the lb position middle is wide open well see if they can get a stop im not feeling it
not over boys lets go
time to shine d
i like the fact benny is hyping up the big guys on the sidelines
need a huge stop here defense
finley will not throw the ball
if finely burns us i will be sad
if finley runs for one yard on this drive im going to scream
fin to get over eager throw a pick6 incoming
we need a take away
pic now plz
gonna be a run run pass series for bengals
wish we had the bengals running game
jesus fucking christ the whole world knows theyre running the ball
wow a qb sneak imagine that
running it down our throats
if they keep running it which they should we are screwed
awful spot
fuck you zebras
hits running back at the line of scrimmage guy still gets 4 yards nice
you have got to be kidding me
probably a wrap fuck

he cant even throw it away right
minkah stays home
minkah nice tackle
i really dont want ot but we obviously cannot go for 2 if we get a td we just gotta score and hold them
once again defense showed up and the game is literally in the offense hands
finally we tackle the qb on a run
corvette corvette
lol well
i think its time for the moon over my hammy audible
welp
no mistakes force ot come on ben
what a fucking bum
wtf is that
offense is just bad
great drive
ugh im sad
missing ebron
the one dpi yo not call
smh
fuck this team

just kill me

also may cincinnati never get penei sewell
might as well start the postgame thread now
can we veto the playoffs
cmon ben at least give him a chance
what an embarrassment
its matt stafford time
steelers bungled
apparently we are a terrible 110 team
juju on that beat
still cant stop the run
we not even bothering with that last time out
removed
god i hate sports sometimes
sadly we need to retool the offensive line and qb needs to be addressed couple of down years for these receivers incoming
i wonder if tomlin will let roethlisberger take the field why risk him taking a hit
just disappointed really not much else to be said
this team has no discipline
fuck
i dont want to give up im not n thinking i dont watch well be better i left 20min we scored came back 4 n out game over
smh thats why you dont act like an asshole and disrespect a team by dancing on their logo pregame no less youre off back to back losses one to a sub 500 team and you feel the need to show off pregame come on man act like youve been there before

tomlin needs to instill some fucking discipline im not one of those guys who has a hissy fit because tomlin is not screaming all the time like cowher nor am i one of those they should have no fun types but this shit is symptomatic of a larger problem dropped passes needless unforced penalties decemberjanuary meltdowns locker room drama aired to the media playing down to lesser competition all this shit has been common place in the tomlin era and it all comes down to a lack of discipline i know mike gets really pissy when the term is used but stop behaving like a players coach and people will stop calling you one
jesus christ you people hes fucking dancing dancing if you have a problem with having fun while living out your dream career you can suck a dick next thing were gonna start doing is banning rock music in the locker room cause its satanic
juju do another dance
i cant help but blame the goodell and the nfl for our team falling apart ever since the ravens game like you should have made them forfeit and now we went from a sb favorite to dead in 4 games the lack of consistent guidelines this season is honestly disgraceful im pissed
its game if they score the offense is too inconsistent and the defense is officially broken
that was for tiktok juju
the second this dancing on the logo shit gets talked about midgame like it just has been it needs to end

im all for fun but its a storyline thats not going to go away until it stops and its already fucking annoying
looking at that 3 times how was it not targeting and how did they not say one thing about that
im rooting for the bengals steelers need to know theyre the worst team in the north before thinking about playoffs
bench this idiot pathetic
damn how jujus own team fan base hates him
dont trip yet obviously 3 scores against the ass bengals at the half is bad but the steelers are no doubt 17 points better than the bengals they can make this up its sports it happens
you cant spell bench without ben
gonna lose the division to the browns lmfao
cant wait to see jujus tick tock tonight
sooo i expect to see no juju tik toks on logos lol
steeler fans know we gave this game away considering we had mad turnovers in the first half gave up some bad run plays by the qb in the 2nd half not saying we are super bowl champion quality just saying we have a chance in the playoffs it aint over
steelers are on fire literally burning down
i hate redditors
juju instagram had 0 effect on ben fucking this game you people are fucking toxic and i hope we lose just so you can all shut the fuck up toxic cunts
is it weird that i want rudolph in
bench ben stop letting fichtner call the plays let any random person in the crowd play at wide receiver

three things that would instantly give this offense a major boost
we might get shut out
god this team sucks
petition to ban tiktok for players
actually snell was never down he should be free to run
thats dpi come the fuck on
three plays in a row with horrible spots
ben is a trash heap and tomlins idea of coaching is saying meaningless phrases and yelling at guys to execute
review tape talk to your qb coach check in with the oc talk to your receivers nah he just gonna pout like a bitch

bitch ben
looking forward to the carson wentz steelers going 412 next year
tomlin i dont care if we lose out the rest of the season i have another non losing season
if its a four possession game going into halftime you gotta bench ben and send a message the performance by this offense is the as bad and probably worse than anything we saw last year not blaming ben or the coaching staff or anyone this is just outta hand
steve levy just is the worst mf announcer he never has a single interesting thing to say
he can walk so he can play
cincinnati is basically kentucky fuck kentucky
that moment when your getting fucked by ryan finley
oof thats soft no lie

at least the rams can rest easy seeing this upset 145 point favorites lmao 110 to 116 so fast youll miss it
lost to a 2101 team this team absolutely blows right now
hit on the throw


matt stafford aint making plays getting hit like that either
who cares what record we end with we still going out in divisional round
whos excited for days of our steelers to come back
anyone who said bring in rudolph is a clown who doesnt know wtf theyre talking about
this is not a deep playoff team and anyone who says youre overreacting needs to be realistic we cant dominate the fucking bengals with a backup qb rb and wr give me a fucking break this team will lose in the first round of the playoffs this team needs to be rebuilt and a new oc would help
the boomers are really coming out in droves tonight huh
ben is done idk why people in here refuse to see it dude needs to do the steelers a favor and retire at the end of this season
now you understand why nobody took steelers serious all year
11 drops holy shit diontae
i think we will have a kickoff or punt returned for a td tonight one can hope right
3 and outs is not what they want who would have guessed
now i remember why i dont come into these game threads
he got fucking pushed and no flag what the fuck
i dont understand why we cant run like that
the steelers are def the worst offense in football
can we put in a backup qb while ben works on his throw
ben has gotten worse as the year as went okor as defense figured he was only throwing short
i called it we cant even complete a fuckin passthis offense is more fucked than ms gangbang 1987
we want to be more physical calls passes on 5 of first 6 plays fincher sucks
no separation by the wideouts so far making it to easy for the bengals secondary
am i crazy or could ray ray have fair caught and scooped the ball up instead of losing us another ten yards
that punt landed on the 34 while ray ray watched it hit then bounce to the 19wth dude fair catch it at least
hot take ben homers beware

look i love 7 as much as the best guy and this isnt an over reaction from the first two drives lets be serious this has been going on for months a more likely way to the 7th lombardi is to get one of the free agent or fringe qbs that will be available next season ben just doesnt seem to have the juice anymore
big ben optimists wya
fucking retire ben you fat fuck you suck
literally the most pathetic start to a game offensively that i can remember i have no interest in watching this shit

bengals defense celebrating like they won
i just wanna remind you all that this is the team that probably will get the third pic overall
if they get a td were done we cannot score more than 7 points
anybody hear aqib talib in the booth yesterday who thought that was a good idea holy shit
elite benjals d
hate to say it but this offense is trash i hope they can turn things around
imagine if ben could make those throws
bench ben
just texted landry jones


motherfucker left me on read
retaliation for the logo
that looked like a fumble
claypool was wide open middle of the field
vonn bell with that sweeet sweet chin music
leading with the crown
no runninggame and ben playing like a dunce one and done in the playoffs there is something wrong with bens arm hes probably just to proud to admit it bench this fatfuck
put rudolph in or do fucking something
bench
definitely fumble but caused by helmet to helmet that being said offense is ass
really need an oline if we want to go any further hard to have any sort of offense when one part of it is nonexistent
cant go 3andout if you lose it before 3 downs are even complete

head tap gif
i wonder if the game callers like jujus dancing or not
yall need to stop complaining the standard is the standard of course
its a miracle we are only down to 30
the better quarterback is wearing orange tonight and its not even close this offense top to bottom is absolute fucking trash just put us out of our misery
we losing this game lmao
115 idk how we are even gonna be this good
i cant wait to hear how many of you will still defend ben to the death tomorrow
how isnt that a fucking flag
allergies


catches


running


first downs
welp kiss next year goodbye as well cause of bens cap hit
pour another oneor seven
you have a wr whose been nicknamed after one of the best of all time he is 64 and fast so naturally dont throw to him when hes open but throw a short slant please by all means
that was pi
now 4 calls that were blantent we know the name of the game
refs and ben you done fucked up aaron
ben is going to get someone killed
maybe our coaches havent told our players that we suck yet
feed benny snell
twerking on that first third down coversion
has that play ever worked
hey ben

tomlining
mason would be better at this point lol
gotta consider benching ben its time
so you guys dont want trubisky
big bens arm is shot
cool guys picking sideline fights will get this thing on track
bye ben see ya
someone get ben outta there hot garbage
okay fuck ben for that holy shit
big ben is garbage
i finally had enough first game ive turned off all season

ben better leave that coat on
hey ben just an fyiyoure not coming back next year
the tik tok steelers
go ahead and tell me to pass on the playoffs

this team is compete fucking trash fuck them
need to sit ben at least a drive show him he had to earn the right to play
even our defense cant be good when our shit offense cant give them a breather at all
just go to rudolph or wildcat or fuck knows what else cant be worse than what weve seen
its the thirst thirstiest time of the year


i have just one query wanna sprite cranberry


the answer is clearrrrrr
obviously hes a steeler legend but are you guys excited that he wants to keep playing after this year
dude what happened to ben he was playing okay earlier in the year
put rudolph in
they are throwing to play the bills im very serious
this is an embarrassment i guess tomlin is just happy to be in the playoffs and not needs to win in them


honestly i cant even be mad thats a w lol
looks like the steelers are the receiver of the refs wrath this week
what happened to your team i dont think ive ever seen regression this bad before
i dont even want that flag juju deserved that
its about fucking time they flagged these assholes for something
long tradition of stupid fucking bengals cbs
boneheaded ass move by that guy
bens pretty trash but the cincy d is lock down
i want to be angry but i also want to be rational but i also want to binge eat two pounds worth of deer jerky
all of twitter and reddit is going nuts talking about juju disrespecting the bengals and them embarrassing the steelers lol its trending topics
oh my god this is like a complete bumblefest yall they really are better than this they needed a break and never got one this is the result f2020
run it on 2nd and 22 nice
is samuels mentally challenged
lmfao this is comical
stop the pointcount
i hate to say it but ben is looking a lot like eli did in his final season crazy how fast he has declined can only hope he can get over this and make one final run
lol i got downvoted earlier this game and im going to say it again i think we take a shot at trey lance this draft
we need a qb for real
removed
ben the ducking goat
ben mahomes
wow running outside the tackles someone should tell james connor he can do that too
my fault i watched the whole first half turned it off saw you guys saying they were playing well turned it back on and they suck
were gonna be one and done in the playoffs
wtf are we doing how the hell are we actually losing to a 2 win team
the announcers really are deep throating the bengals
williamson is very soft
shameful performance by our defense in second half
the defense is clearly tired spent so much time on the field already
honestly its 10d chess if were sandbagging until the playoffs to catch our wild card opponents off guard
false starts are so obvious thanks ref
tinfoil curtain
please stop smiling please stop smiling please stop smiling please stop smiling
they were going to throw how did the coaching staff not see that the bengals had no interest in watching finley turn it over
lol this is on the offense
highsmith is ass
fucking embarrassingthey dont even look like they want to win this game they deserve to be bounced in the first round
boys next year we have burrow jackson and mayfield this division will always be a slugfest fuck the records this is afc north football
blame ben or blame tomlin
fuck it score a td go for 2
the clock didnt stop when he went out of bounds
ben looks so fucking scared
reminder that lamar jackson cant throw
burn all that clock to try and throw a pick
ben status finished not finished finished
god damnit ben juju was open for a touchdown too
ben looks like a fucking bean bag trying to throw a football tonight
a footballthemed tiktok ad after blasting jujus tiktok all night you really cant script it any better lol
why do they care about connor all he does is get hurt
season status super bowl bust super bowl bust
ref balled lol
gimme that flacco special
we needed that bailout so bad
hopefully the defense got a good rest
hey ben ran under center and snell got a td how odd
a run on 3rd 1 after running a pass play on 2nd 1 what awful play calling holy shit
so how we feel about the offense this drive im not feeling confident
this fkn game givin me the nervous farts
quadruple coverage means someone was fucking open you moron
ben is a fucking idiot
they deserve this
claypool doesnt high point the ball as much as he should with his size
why the fuck would anyone cast tebow in an ad

dude was a joke and a washup
these ten seem impossible to achieve
not a single fucking yard
gg bengals you deserve the win we dont even deserve the division at this point ill always ride with the steelers but for the past 3 years iv seen this team time and time and time again come up stagnant in december last year we had the playoffs on the line and lost to a 2 win jets team the year before a 2 win raiders team and now a 2 win bengals team luckily we already clinched i dont have a whole ton of confidence next week when we face the colts our offense made the bengals defense look like the legion of boom look what the bills did too us i see similar results on the horizon also randy for the past 3 years has been our oc i think its time we let him go what hes doing is inexcusable
offensive line is garbage al and chuks fucking suck
gg division

take an oline man first and second round maybe get a qb 3rd

okorafor cant block shit
what the fuck happened to this team
ok save this comment haters

steelers lead 2117 at the end of the 3rd come eat crow when im right or ill happily eat it if im wrong

this isnt over chill
were 5 minutes into the first quarter yall need to chill
my man should stop the dancing i love him hyping the team up but its just a shitshow
just put in rudolph so that we can have a better excuse for losing this game give us a fall guy and best case he ends up playing good enough to beat the bengals
how do you not get this team motivated to clinch the division against the bengals no less coach seats need to be hotter than lava in the off season
for the tomlin defenders how do you explain this meltdown and complete failure to change our gameplan over the last month
i find it crazy how last season everyone begged for ben to be back now everyone will be begging for rudolph to be back
these are the steelers 100 was not the steelers
lets be real ben wasnt going to stay consistent this long
it feels like too little too late
chase plays football like soccer
honestly i hope this team crashes straight into the ground hopefully it means ben retires and we get randy the fuck out of town ive seen 8 year olds on madden run more inspired offenses
the titans also lost to the bengals mm
113 and people are done being fans lmao grow up would you rather be the jets these fans are so spoiled

these last 3 games sucked but football is crazy you never know what will happen least they looked slightly better in the 2nd half best theyve looked in weeks
tomlin better get these fuckers in order and juju better stay the fuck off social media for the next 2 months
im sick of this tik tok shit every week
the racist west virginia steelers fans actually somehow blaming this game on tomlin when this is squarely on ben
are you ficking kidding me with that bills crowd welcoming the team back what the actual fuck i didnt t know covid was gone
ben thank you for the amazing memories i think its time to hang up the cleats though bud
tomlin is gonna let ben take another wednesday off cause he literally has no control over his players
if only juju would have stayed off tiktok we would have won
were gonna get dashed by giovani fucking bernard
doomers out early tonight eh
we are going 115
jesus whats with everyone shitting on ben hes led us to 11 wins so far this season theres a very good chance hes playing through an injury right now
they really are a bunch of fucking frauds what a shame this fanfuckingtastic defense is being wasted for this fucking abortion of an offense
you can say we shouldve kept bell or ab or anyone but the problem is at the qb
ben is completely washed up dude needs to get on the tb12 method or something brady is 43 and still lighting it up
im not saying ben is bad or rudolph is good and should be playing but i honestly think the steelers offense would look better with rudolph in right now

some of these throws are insane his arms look like theyre both broken
this is expected tho right i mean the benjals have been elite this year people are making too big of a deal of one game
jujus gotta stop dancing on peoples logos
you know its bad when people want rudolph in haha
leading with the helmet helmet to helmet contact nah calls like that clearly dont exist
maybe hell stop with the tik tok dances after that hit
bad juju for juju dancing on the logo
tf thats a fucking burfict kind of play
how the hell do people think that was jujus fault the ball was thrown to him at least he fucking caught it unlike other pass catchers we have
kevin greene is looking down at the steelers rn and loling
im about to go to bed this team is such a waste of time worst 110startteam ever
hey ben how about you fucking do something for us on offense if anyone genuinely thinks we survive the playoffs then you are delusional at least when we ran the gauntlet from the wild card we had some sort of producing offense
steelers fans be like

fichtners fault we cant run

people who know football be like well if the offensive line implodes every time then
fire fichtner and trade for darnold
juju really gotta stop dancing on logos
i love you ben and everything you have done for this team but i am ready for you to move on my guy its time for someone new
how about we stop bitching and get the motherfuckers moving these are our guys

bring in rudolph he cant play worse than ben at this point ben has hit the bengals players hands more than he has his own receivers
were an 112 team currently loosing to an 2101 team wtf
dobbs go get it
guys this is all because of jujus dancing
would it be better to go 110 and then humiliate ourselves until the end of our season or go 115 and get landry fields or lawrence if we got lucky id rather sit through a year of losses to feel like we have a future than watch this im a spurs fans and this reminds me of rolling with derozan and aldridge for a tenth seed lol
anyone still want to claim that jujus dancing has no effect on the other team ill wait
please for the love of all that is good holy bring in rudolph

bench ben
yall think the steelers are gonna get any points tn
im beyond done with ben
fumbled the snap
throws to juju when its clear hes gonna get lit up and had claypool wide open
throws a pick
ben is a fucking bum
we really miss dupree i know you can say defense isnt the problem but dupree was a playmaker he could at least get the quarterback to make a bad interception and it would change the feel of the game we lack that now thats what vonn miller did for the broncos when peyton manning was at the end of his career like ben is now
anybody else excited for the nba at this point im just ready to get off this roller coaster
so who you guys want run it back with ben mitch trubisky can i interest you in wentz nick foles

maybe the packers shit the bed and rodgers gets mad and demands a trade pretty sure he hates the packers so that could be cool
ben needs to swallow his pride and retire romo knew when it was time so should ben
cowardly effort by d on this drivepussies

fuck keith butler mike tomlin and randy fichtner for wasting so much talent over the years
time to hang em up ben thats just atrocious
retire ben ffs


pi lord omg
the actual called pi on the last steelers td was a pretty meh call the non call there was bad so guess it all evens out
bens fucking garbage
this week on days of our steelers
can juju stop dancing to give every other team more reason to want to win
juju is cursing you guys
here is my issue with juju maybe he sees the dancing on the logo as harmless but other teams dont the titans gathered on the ravens logo earlier this season and it created a ruckus between both teams

what he does is disrespectful to other teams and it hurts our team and creates a distraction while putting a target on his back yet he is so vain so enamoured with himself he cant find it in his heart to stop doing this for the good of his team

thats what hurts but hey who am i
this was the worst 110 team in history
lets go ben how about practicing more than once a week

ben should not return next year and thats a reality we need to face the steelers should draft a qb this year maybe mac jones or kyle trask and go from there this team isnt going very far if ben continues to play like this ben is at the end of his career period
mason or duck this offense is demoralized
juju should dance less and learn how to hold onto the ball pop
the logo dancing is fucking retarded if i was a defender i would look to light up that fucker and knock the tik tok out of him jesus fucking christ im heated just for stupid dancing
member when we were worried about that the team didnt look great despite being undefeated and people told us to stfu i member
im all for our guys headhunting now if the refs are going to keep letting these bastards get away with it
youre playing a young raw rival team that has two wins in december and absolutely nothing to lose why on earth would you brag all week about how you are going to dance on their logo and then provoke them by doing it and why on earth would the coach not put his fucking foot down about it you trying to motivate this team to play their asses off for pride
the best thing ben can do for this city is retire
im convinced its not randys fault anymore im so sorry please dont leave us
ok i am done i may check scores on espn to see if we make a game of it but this is just hard to watch right now

i bet 827 on the steelers winning the first half thought it was a lock but this team keeps fucking me
to all of you guys saying he danced on the logo like this is not the reason the bengals are playing their superbowl right now clearly never played the sport this fanbase would burn down pittsburgh and strangle a player with a terrible towel if they dared to dance on your logo pregame
look i understand scoring a td in the nfl is an incredibly difficult thing to do

but do we really need to see the busby berkeley dance routines

in the end zone after each and every one

spiking the ball triumphantly pumping both fists

high fives all around back slaps helmet slaps i get that

just sick and tired of the dancing with the stars bullshit
4th quarter opinion im not mad if we lose im not depressed it happens and i feel lucky to be a fan of a team that made it through this season with 11 wins with zero run game and butterfingers galore

i love the steelers and always will

i also remember 20052006 when we made it to the playoffs just barely and only survived the colts thanks to a shoe string tackle of nick harper who was stabbed by his girlfriend din the thigh the night before by big ben when jerome coughed it up

shitrefresh my memorydid we make it to the super bowl that year
ben is so washed up this is scary
kevin greene looking down and shaking his head
sportcenter not even calling out the illegal hit on juju ffs
what was ebrons injurya vagina pull
imagine if management told ben fuck your feelings we need a qb for the future and drafted someone like jalen hurts or lamar jackson
karma for juju doing the logo dance bullshit tomlin needs to shut that down but never will
where are you apologists where are you oh itll be ok people how about the youre all bandwagoners assholes this is what we are you idiots
you pussys done crying now
do you guys honestly think our guys arent trying to win what do you think our guys are doing weve lost so many people these past 4 games due to injuries add to that we got shafted with a week 4 bye and no break during thanksgiving and having 3 games in 12 days our guys are exhausted but they are still out their busting their ass dont act like our team is entirely to blame for our shortcomings lately that turns a blind eye to the reason it occurred

anyone who says im whining i dont care if we win the sb or not im here for football to take me away from the bleak outlook of the world today so quit with those youre a child hot takes shit happens and this shit did effect us you are wearing rose colored glasses if you think otherwise lol
wild how washed ben is
this tiktok shit is so cringe
hate to say it but colin cowherd is right about us
this stupid fuck was actually dancing on the logos again after last week
maybe the bengals d wouldnt be so fired up if we didnt have a fucking tik toker dancing on their logo
tell me again which team has 11 wins cos i cant tell juju needs to quit fuckin dancing and start catching balls ben is throwing like wentz mapletron aint doing shit even if when we make playoffs we gonna be one and done playing like this
and people in the sub said i was crazy overreacting for saying they finish 115 losing last 5 games

ravens browns gonna be handed the afcn

10 win streak since 2015 over bengals gone

might as well be one and done in playoffs cant even knock off a 2 win team

edit team correction
this has been one of the most embarrassing nights of my life as a steelers fan

it doesnt help that juju makes himself an easy target dancing like an idiot for tiktok before games

fuckin a what a rough night
he fucking deserved that im just being myself no youre pissing these defenses the fuck off
juju needs to work on catching rather than dancing on teams logos lmao
ben you fucking cunt just fucking retire
score predictions 3114 steelers
removed
stop trying to make the muppets happen its never going to happen
ben is bad man

edit on the deep ball
ben has zero arm strength
so pretty clear nothing has changed
juju wide openwhy does ben want dj so bad
first play of the game and its severely underthrown and almost picked offnot good
did derek just take himself out
watt just knocked himself out
oh my fucking god lets over react after 3 plays
good to see weve changed up our play calling deep ball run on 2nd and long and a short pass on 3rd and long we have a bottom 3 oc lmfao
he got kod protocol time
why cant we run the ball like that
lead him way too much and not enough power behind the ball
bad throw
i cant stand the color commentator
yall think ben is washed
omg i was freaking out cause i didnt know where it was it was in abc but itsaid the fucking bachelor was on
goddamnit just one of these games huh smh
do you guys want trubisky
i always say this team makes me want to jump off a bridge but now im actually gonna do it
the season is literally crumbling before our eyes
terrible route
were losing this game too our offence is brutal
then one foggy christmas monday tomlin came to say rudolph with your head so big wont you throw a pass tonight
retire after the game ben
i never thought id say this but bring in mason lmao
ben is awful just awful sorry to say
jesus fuck ben get it together
what the fuck happened to us ben
this is last years team
im about to go play cyberpunk as bad as that game is still probably gonna be more fun than this turnout
one more bad series from ben i gotta say bench before ben was doing good balls and the wideouts were droppingbut now wtf is up
big ben is gonna throw like 4 interceptions tonight huh
so whos looking forward to the playoffs
play calling is still trash and ben looks terrible
on the bright side if our offense plays poorly like this they have to fire fichtner right
stop dancing on there logo you deserved that juju
this is one ugly game so far and you expect it from the bengals is this a case of steelers playing down to their opponent or are the bengals that hungry and stoked for a division rival right now its the ben show and he could be much better
bengals need to bury us we dont deserve it and the steelers need to know they arent even the second best team in the afc north
how did this team win 11
helmet to helmet hit there
ben hung him out to dry right there
he lowered his head and made contact with his helmet first
less dance practice more football practice
112 or 211
fuck those refs that was incomplete
juju needs to stop this dumb shit
it would be a huge mistake letting big ben be the qb to start next year hes aged 40 years in these last 4 weeks unreal decline
we have more fumbles than first downs
let samuels run
bench ben
so boys how do we stay positive about this team at this point im out of nice things to say and my hope for the team is gone so im gonna need your guys help
bad first quarter lets adjust
have we swung from coty to fire tomlin yet lol
man fuck this qb up if hes gonna keep running pop his ass
this is embarrassing do they care
ben washed
ben seriously needs to get his shit together this drive that first quarter was worse than mason and duck
unleash hell in december
tomlin is getting schooled by zack taylor lol
i mean this is typical steeler play in cincyif your leaving it better only be to get your popcorn ready
i laugh because we dont deserve a playoff spot at all but the team that weve pushed out is the ravens hahah kinda nice to think about in all of this chaos
is ebron pulling a limus sweed
no fucking flag really
wow that shoulda been picked off too
ben is gonna get our entire offense killed
jesus christ bench him before he gets these guys killed
way to put ebron in position to get hurt ben
bens arm is a fucking wet noodle
bens main aim is hospitalise all the options and then say he had no one to throw to
ben needs to fix his mind hes not the same as he was even two seasons ago he hasnt had a good read once this game
i miss munchak
so when does ben bench himself because that would be the only leadership move he could make this week
if bens excuse is his knee then sit him until week 17 or the wild card

if he is healthy sit him and get rudolph reps because hes washed
ben is gonna get our entire o killed just hang em up if you dont wanna do it anymore man
joe burrow would demolish this team
my god this offense is offensive how did we devolve this hard
diontae caught it
so kicks to the face are legal now
dj actually working to get better juju tik toking pre game get rid of that clown juju immediately
i think we gotta sit ben
fuck this qb fuck this offensive line

losing to the worst team in the nfl

fuck this
just kill me
ben has wanted to throw an interception so much this game
thats it bens shot done washed old doesnt have it
hes seeing ghosts
am i actually going to turn off this game before halft8me
bench ben now
ben fucking blowwwwws
get ben the fuck out of there this is unacceptable
ben playing like hes fucking high as a kite
if hes not benched theres nothing else to say
ben said this week he felt like he still could help this team win games if hes going to play like this just please bench him and retire right now is not helping at all and defenses dont respect him anymore id rather lose with the scrubs who have zero expectations
put me in i threw better than this in powderpuff in college
alright lets go browns whos with me
fraud ass team
put me down as one of the i dont want to see ben again people
what a fucking smooth brain fuck you okorafor
i still have faith in ben but i need the whole ic light brewery for this game
when was the last time the steelers played this bad in a half
current ben is not enough good enough to be the 3rd string on any nfl team
im ready to be absolute garbage for an elite qb pick
looks like steelers dont want to make it to playoffs
rudolph has to play the second half ben isnt the guy tonight hes done
i hate mason but i would take him at this point
this team is so fucking soft at every position its a miracle they won 1 game let alone 11
avery williamson has cursed this team
sign kapernick
this is funny right
bench every last one who didnt show up to play hit the locker room play with 12 total
if we lose how much are those damn muppets to blame
its ok everyone tomlin wont make any changes at half
ok i was trying to stay positive but jfcput mason in
i dont understand people saying that ben doesnt care or that hes blaming everyone else im sure hes pretty upset with this performance
anyone else remember seeing people speculating that were saving stuff for the playoffs lol
remember how many people in this subreddit were upset when this team didnt get the respect it deserves
ben needs to pull a vontae davis
ben needs to retire period
i wish we could be eliminated from play off contention cause oh boy is that game gonna be embarrassing
tik tok star juju
please explain to me why u run it 2nd and 6 3 mins left in the half ur down by 17
im convinced terry bradshaw could come back and play better
mackenzie alexander is a clown im glad we dumped him did you know he didnt have an interception in high school college out playing in minnesota
i shouldve started ben on fantasy
lol remember when people said that teams dont get motivated about jujus dances idk the 210 bengals look pretty fucking motivated to me
i deadass would rather see this team with ben and juju on the bench to start the second half i was up my own ass about jujus antics and ben just straight up blows
bens got the yips right now need another qb
2nd and 22 run up the middle in essence the steelers are punting well at least someone said it lol
bench samuels
if we judge that as a drive and not as a half

its pretty bad but not that bad
nice hold d doing what yall been doing all year
inject this ben benching into my fucking veins

i dont care if we win send a message you dont get to be paid 30 mil a year refuse to take a pay cut and put on that performance on national tv

sit your ass down
large benjamins still got it
at least the facebook crowd is gone for now
ok were winning this game now hahah
needs to be caught
fuckin run it in
hopefully thats a pulled or strained hammy
this is our team ben isnt done jujus done with the bullshit and our def is gonna keep rolling

oh mama im in fear for my life
from the long arm of the law
lawman has put an end to my running
and im so far from my home
oh mama i can hear you a crying
and youre so scared and all alone
hangman is coming down from the gallows
and i dont have very long

this jig is up the news is out
theyve finally found me
the renegade who had it made
retrieved for a bounty
never more to go astray
this will be the end today of the wanted man
now our defense is getting gashed lmao
defense is so depleted
that still counts as an int
defense needs to hold here they have had plenty of rest in second half no excuses
why does our d do this last few years we finally start clawing back and they give up a drive
defense let us down
the defense has checked out
damn time is running out
defense is gassed
fucking morons on defesnse

game over tomlin deserves blame when this happens every time
like i said always go for it in the red zone

the other teams not gonna just sit around

and let you catch up and not score even more points
guys its the bengals superbowl
damn do these commentators love sucking the bengals dick or what
bye randy


bye ben


bye tiktok boy
why do we keep trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to running the ball
i feel the need to mention that they didnt stop the clock on that juju play after he ran out of bounds might not matter but worth the mention now in case it does
big bens arm is completely shot

receiver drops are coming back lmao
what are we doing this team needs to beat the bengals if they want to get to the super bowl
no guys ben was aiming for him hes getting in their heads playing the mental game here
ben is done how can anyone pretend he isnt
fire randy why are you running the fucking ball
we just got bailed out
cheap flag at first look
this jig is up the news is out
theyve finally found me
the renegade who had it made
retrieved for a bounty
never more to go astray
the judge will have revenge today
on the wanted man
guys i think the team was overrated
i guess to are just something we dont believe in anymore
int or 4 and out
under two minutes ben engaged
pi but ok
why the fuck is tim tebow still relevant
too little too latewell getem next week
lol how are you guys so fucking good but also so fucking bad
ben is fucking done
retire
gosh we suck but only we can say that if any mf other team wants to come in gear and say that shit see yah in the playoffs
no low hit on the qb
ben blew it
at least i have the lakers lol
we are fucking losers
lmao so bad
minisuperspreader event
wth we deserved that loss
holy fuck watt just died
pro bowl caliber play dude have you ever watched a pro bowl its almost flag football what a stupid comment
lmao yall believe me now when i said since week 5 this team not winning a sb
im here to listen about how ficthner is the problem with the offense
i dont care what anyone says this team plays like they have 0 championship aspirations
diontae didnt even go for the ball at all even as the guy was bobbling it what the heck never ever seen that he doesnt seem invested or like he wants to be there at all
take ben out hes done im not okay with letting us lose half our talent to pay a qb who has an ego with a qbr of 2 demanding max contracts
im about to get downvoted all to hell but its time to bench ben rudolph cant play any worse than what bens been doing
might be time to bring in mason for a few drives
i already stopped watching
everything ends badly or it wouldnt end ben is done might as well play mason at this ppint
what is pittsburg doing
tik tok that juju
ben is fucking terribly holy fuck bench his ass
checkdown ben
fuck tiktok leave your effing phone at home
at least we wont be the ones to pay juju all the money he wants no real loss
browns are gonna win this fucking division lmao
idgaf what they say you cant talk shit when youre 2111
what is the problem isnt fichtner but the offensive unit

what if randy has been the dude making magic happen and we all want him gone this makes me shutter
as a ravens fan im really concerned i have to root for this team the next two weeks potentially im really not trying to troll what is going on
offensive about to light it up
there is no fucking way steelers lose to the bungals no way
never thought i would say this but its time for rudolph to come out
all of you blaming fichtner yet cant admit that he aint the quarterback that is playing like total dogshit
whats up with the brigading from multiple fans from multiple teams lol rentfree much
fucking retire
take ben out
at least we know how good this team could be with a good qb
late to the party how are we looking
guys dont freak out its the strat think about it man

you just limp into a division title make everyone think youre dead and then bam you surprise em and win the super bowl
time to bring in the duck not mason the duck quack quack lets gooooooo
mike tomlin has proved again that his teams are not mentally strong enough to handle full seasons
their defense is playing like a number 1 defense
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucking fuck fuck ben porncock what the fuck
is there any team fans that are more small time than bengals lmao
bench ben
isnt unsportsmanlike a dead ball foul so you enforce the holding and then apply the personal foul so it winds up 5 to the steelers and a first down
we were in no hurry with only 330 left in the half and zero points so far tells me all i need to know
if your older than 30 stfu about juju dancing
i started a diet just before that wft game getting into the chocolate now boys

bench ben for fucks sake hes out there not giving a shit
id like to see a different qb in there to try a light a fire under their ass

if something doesnt change the season is over
ben looking like humpty dumpty
i dont want to see conner the rest of the year
maybe connor is a bigger part of the problem than we think
lmaooo no losing seasons
im going to bed wake me up when we inevitably lose wild card weekend

go for 2 im serious
they cant stop em done its frustrating but its mostly on the offense for gifting short fields repeatedly on the first half
ben you fucking suck bro
ben has to retire
what was snell doing in that 4th down he blocked no one
another missed pass interference call and refs suck name a better duo
thats a tough loss man looks like the north is in doubt the steelers are going in the wrong direction
please beat indy next week yall
i actually dont expect tomlin to say much he doesnt usually throw ben under the bus and honestly his play was mostly why we lost
how about juju quits dancing and does more catching
no more dancing
we have wide receiver with the mental capacity of a 12 year old
damn steelers suck lol
browns finna win afc north
were losing this game arent we lol
if the dancing is gonna be a narrative juju has to stop
juju can go tik tok dance and get 4 yards per reception for 100 million dollars elsewhere
tomlin needs to tell juju that from now on if he dances on a logo he sits for the whole game
someone tell juju to stop dancing on teams logos
stop the doomsday stuff guys sports are streaky the team sucks bench ben are you guys kidding me i would legit still take a straight up bet that the steelers win this game mahomes sucked this week the jets are better than the rams

if were still down 3 scores at the end of the 3rd ill admit i was wrong but until then im confident
fuck tomlin another tomlin special tonight
tj out there laughing that derek knocked himself out
feed juju james and chase dont throw to dj or eric anymore
this next drive is game defining if we three and out again its over
shoulda paid bell
announcers have been on the other teams dick for the last forever games
bens been playing for 16 years hes done
honestly at this point resign everyone on the defense and just gut the offense get rid of conner toss out juju let decastro walk and force ben out just rebuild that shit bc at this point these guys are all washed
fucking done fuck this offense fuck ben fuck juju especially fuck fichtner fuck this bullshit fuck fuck fuckity fuck no comfort fuck this offensive effort no excuses this offense fucking sucks
ben is in sweatpants and tennis shoes and mason is warming up
gonna be honest i think its time for ben to retire and we look into a new qb pj walker would be nice to have
this ineptitude starts at the top its starts at tomlin
lmao number 1 defense my fucking ass
ben is washed oline is washed juju can stop the logo shit anytime he wants defense is far too injured and gives up big plays in the second half
everyone talks about how tomlin hasnt had a losing season but i would love to have cowher back
ben is washed
derek watt died on the only play hes ever been in on
i mean not trying to be a boomer but karma is a bitch juju
if you think jujus tiktoks are the problem here gtfo
and steelers fans got mad when everyone was calling them frauds at 100 maybe people were on to something
cant wait to see how juju responds to this game on his postloss twitch livestream
hahahahah throwing into triple coverage like you havent not made a throw all night hahahah fuck you
keep dancing on other teams logos juju

we lost dupree for ben

fuck this gay earth
come on i expect better from the best team in the league
tomlin is a fucking asshole
im beyond pissed these fucking frauds waited to clinch a playoff spot before they showed who they are instead of doing the decent thing and tanking like trash teams are supposed to
wow the flag bailed us out that was a horrible throw by ben
couldnt get a single first down this team is pathetic fuck you steelers see you again soon and fuck you

should have went to bed after the half like i was about to
3 straight losses fuck these losers
fuck you fat fuck ben youre playing one of the worst defenses and you cannot even get a first down you gifted them all of their points so far you washed up shit stain of a qb
an overrated qb who just doesnt care anymore and receivers whod rather dance on logos and make tiktoks than play football fml
no losing seasons standard is the standard
91 here we go
cant lie kermet gave me a good laugh
what did we just witness
anyone else unable to stream using spectrum
waka waka waka
anybody have a decent stream the one i normally used is terrible right now
lfg
here we go offense hoping gets a groove started n keeps going
good ray ray
alright wrap it up muppets goddamn
ummm
well randy stood by his pledge
they threw down field but was a pretty ugly throw
well that was pi but okay
oh wow
3 and out here we go
short throw by ben love the aggressive play call not an optimal start
ahahahahahaha we suck
hmmm so theres that
i love benny snell turning 10 yard runs into 3 yard runs
oof
oh no
welp
wtf
i wish i could say i wan not expecting a start like this
fuuuuuck i hope hes ok

its going to be one of those games huh
holy fuck hope derek is okay
i am so happy he got up and is walking holy fucking shit i felt sick to my stomach
good vibes for your man there steelers nation
please god dont let this be one of those games where some trash qb looks like montana in his prime against us
jesus christ
damn it man this isnt the start i wanted
pain
good to see him walking
good start manhandled upfront
quick slants stopped working three weeks ago whatd we run quick slants
how is ben on the ground after every god damn play
worst 110 team of all time
i swear if we lose to the bungles im gonna kill a beetle
at least the defense actually came today
and another baker mayfield commercial
your best offense is a defense usually not literally though lol
ffs
fuck this team
fuck

holy fecking shiz yinz
holy shit this team is a joke
wow just wow
wow
yep
f
fuck
welp cant call it a bad drive
wtf is wrong with this team
wtf are we doing
fuxking ben
this team is awful
nice start
were gonna find a way to drop this one arent we
dude wtf
uhhhh not a good look
oh man
thats unfortunate
well that was not ideally
why make it easy
looks like we are improving
these last few games feel like the steelers of 2019 i just dont understand
great
this team has just completely turned on its head fuck even going to the playoffs
i cant handle this team man like wtf
uh that was clearly not pounceys fault
yiiiiiikes
its only a matter of time until watt gets hurt the defense is always on the field
this offense cant be more of a fucking joke right now that play alone showed how this team isnt a playoff contender
maybe they shouldnt be pumping ben with so many pain killers before the game
i dont watch college football is there a decent qb the steelers could draft in round 1 dependance on ben is staggering and when he plays bad theres literally no hope for this offense
defense gonna have to score some tds tonight
what the hell has happened to this offense
pain
not great when our defense he s 1 play off
can we just put out defense in on offense as well
ocho cinco fucking it up
fucking perine man im so conflicted as an ou fan
alright what fuckshit is comin on the next drive
our defense is so good that its crazy how much it masks an otherwise terrible offensive core imagine if we had any offense better than this i can only get so erect
ugh
let mondo run
making the 7 foot guy attempt to go out and make a block in space is pretty weird to me i dont know of any other oc who cant play to the players strengths
if they throw short of the sticks im going to lose my mind
the question here is can they get a fist down against the vaunted bengals defense
what a drive
holy shit this offense man
oh my
looks like duck is back there rn
poor throw
this is just a ugly game so far
it looked like ebron was open on the post route too
one and done
third and long gonna guess screen
i gotsta admitben has a nice stat line
bengal down on the sideline
jordan berry is a stud
my antenna will be up again when we take the lead
what a dime take notes benjamin
how did they complete a deep pass before we did
i think its time to start addressing the fact that bens fallen off a cliff
i was literally about to say that im only interested in watching the defense and then that happens
first downs and points are overrated apparently
guess well need a defensive td
ben take notes
holy fuck offense looks real bad
this offense is absolutely pathetic
its all compounding from the o line ben has to throw too much and the receivers cant get separation because they know the o line cant buy enough time to throw it longer
i wish we can do that
this is embarrasing
bengals 23 first downs 1 turnover
steelers 0 0
lmaooo
jesus christ
offense needs to figure their shit out
so much for my wish of less berry and less 3 and outs
should we just rest are players these next two weeks since were not getting the bye week or winning
haden getting greedy
prayers up for boyd pittsburgh grown
and a new oc
nice edge
the patch work cincy line is getting some push
i love joe
this is not a great team its still good but offense is baaad
im surprised they put haden as the deep return man and not ray ray
this is the best field position the offense will see all day
got lucky there
dude what the fuck he is always smiling
ben has two completions for two total yards
holy fuck ben
guys ben could throw 5 ints they are not going to put mason in
this offense doesnt deserve this defense
that shouldve been picked
ben throws a pick every fuckin play
thanks for the 7yds of field position
this is nothing but speculation on my end but could bens throwing inaccuracies be due to having a different throwing motion
oh boy
would have been behind him anyway
from the browns with loss
fuck it just pull ben it couldnt be any worse
what is that almost three picks now its coming
maybe ben needs to sit a series
the only 6 points this team has scored in the 1st quarter in like 5 weeks has been hadens int return if i remember right
lol
theres literally zero reason to run play action anymore
he should have 4 turnovers
why do we look so bad
ben is having a terrible game jesus
if cincinnati had a top 5 defense there wouldve been at least 3 turnovers already ben is seriously not in it
im glad the defense is having fun and even the bengals offense is having fun steelers offense looks miserable though they know something aint right
that should have been a pick 6
thought i was watching nfl not madden
ben cmon man
fucking throwing to the flats hasnt worked 1 time this year
jesus christ lol
what a play
so were just not going to run the ball again this game then
omg they look like dogshit
posterized
lmao were getting embarrassed
we needed 7 yards
this drive went exactly how we expected
yikes ben
garbage
what the fuck is the point of any other receivers running routes if we are throwing predetermined passes
that was definitely a fumble haha
the middle of the field was so wide open ben couldve under hand threw that
imagine being 3rd and 7 and throwing an incomplete pass to the los
were done
straight to his head
the post was wide open again wtf ben
when is the last time ben completed a pass 10 yards
why even throw to someone on running near the line of scrimmage with a couple defenders on him
ouch juju took a hit on that one
i dont think i can watch this anymore
whats going on
again they dont run a play to the first down
that was more of a football move than that ebron fumble earlier this year the refs and findley saving us so far this is embarrassing
and another 3 and out
watching ben throw like
this is just embarassing beyond belief
worth watching lmao what we doin
wonder what is going through tomlins mind would he consider making a change
they have all the momentum the bengals
looks like a fumble smh
thats a fumble
holy shit this game is shit

god damn
lol
humiliating

didnt they blow the play dead
thank god we have a dfence
probably for the best we have a better chance to score points with our defense on the field
lol wow
is my fantasy team realty going to lose by 10 pts because i started ben and dj
cringe
jesus fucking christ this is painful to watch
now im just curious to see how bad this can get
well that was a quarter of football
they just ran the option with finley again
lmao someone calling out gonna get your qb killed
not really having an issue against this defense
just tuned in what
playoffs
every single person on the offense needs the shit slapped out of them
at least finley got absolutely smacked on that one
yeah please blow us out cincy
rip
the standard is bad passes
corvette corvette
killing me slowly
its over
pain
ima cry
lol
nice
yeah probably time to head off to bed

look at the comments too
come on ebron
how much we owe ben next season
good field position lets goo
holy shit a run play on 1st down
are we breaking records with how bad our offense has been lately we must be
the standard has apparently been lowered
do we get a first down here
i want to eat my phone
another h2h not called shocking
finally run the fuckn ball
run run pass here we come
positive yardage
do you guys think part of the problem is lack of leadership on offense
gotta hit a few deep throws to back the defense off
the announcer said feetner again
wow
fuck yeah yards
im ready to turn this off already
gotta go for it
he ran right into the olinemen
one yard one fucking yard
just sneak it goodness
benny snell is so fucking useless cut that bum already
snell thought we were tying to get trevor martin
he got it nice
benny snell is surprisingly fucking atrocious at short yardage situations remember when he thought that was his speciality
running play


pittsburgh going to the supa bowl
if we cant pick up a yard were fucked
how do you go from 110 to looking like the worst team in the league by a lot the offense isnt even the side that lost players
its just funny at this point
all i got to say is b r u h
yes
oh no short yardage
we can barely gain a godamn yard on two attempts wtff
oh god dont go for it we cant make it
just fucking jump good fucking lord
weee did itttttt
well shit not bad
we got a 1st down
getting a first down should not be such a hurdle
im literally laughing out loud
this offensive line is full of broken down old pansies get the fuck out of here
what the fuck happened since the washington game
breaking the pittsburgh steelers picked up a 1st down
snell man i dont wanna be the first to get a first down
i swear i just saw ben under center nah
cue 3 straight passes after 4 straight runs dial it up randy
lmao couldnt get one fucking yard thank fuck hockey starts up soon
it isnt even close he flew over the line what the fuck
stop the count
i mean not that it matters with the way the offense is playing but that looked like a clear first down to me
what the fuck is up with the whistle the last few weeks they blow it way to eaely
oh my god a first down
alright that does it go get travis ettienne with our first pick
is it just me or did it look like the splits in their dl would have let ben easily sneak that for like two yards
at least we beat the ravens that is all our season will amount to playing this shitty
ben throwing to quadruple teamed receivers and shit
whos the backup te samuels

edit ah yeah they have vance
what good qbs are going to be available late first round
we need to draft a new ol except for decastro
the steelers offense is broken
i saw the gorgeous counter play to set up 3rd and short and somehow believed that our offense had learned how to stop sucking a bag of dicks
yes im sure he probably couldve gotten a flag
finally a 1st from a pass
holy crap an on target thro

diontae with the iron grasp
wow snell yet again got more than 2 yards maybe he will finish with an average of at least 3 ypc tonight
i love how 24 can only get up and pull his pants up
that run was all benny no help from the ol
well i guess mcdonald doesnt practice much as a passers anymore
snell looking pretty impressive promising
thats a pittsburgh steelers


first down
ok dj lets get his confidence going
why is the ball thrown so low
good to see dj putting the work in at least hes had a moderate case of the moncriefs but you have to hope he can work his way out of it
how the fuck is av blocking down there either that was the dumbest play call in history or he fucked up majorly
tarmac randy after the game
lmfao
yey super creative jet sweep wooooow
throw a flag zebras
imploding
hahahaha
nail meet coffin
pain
you deserve hell
lol
damn it ben
im outnot worth losing sleep on a work night
everyones getting pissed
we are melting down rn
claypool being a dickhead great
the playcalling is looking as trash as the last few weeks
right into his hands ben defenders wya
nice block vance
fuck
wtf is ben doing
atrition football
wtf is this shit
add 15 to the run back

just give them more points
sanders
jesus
lolololololol
bengals high stepping on us now oof

okorafor throws a tantrum like a toddler
wow just wow
its been a while since ive felt this way but i legitimately kind of want to stop watching at this point
holy shit this is bad
what am i watching right now
oh my fucking god im in disbelief
man they sure dont miss the flags against us
no velocity on that ball
wtf
guys idk how much more i can watch
ben is gone
this is a fucking mess ben please fucking learn how to read the field
wow
bench ben and okorafor
the defense should just refuse to go on the field
jesus fucking christ how is this team not 49
so they losing by 10 or 30 wild card weekend
weve given them the ball on our side of the field how many times tonight
wtf offense ok this is not excusable at this point
crash and burn this hurts
the browns are salivating watching this game
wish more players cared more like chuks
wew lawd
jesus why didnt he hit dj afraid of the drop
blow out city lol
give me rudolph
wheres my ducky boi
td woohoooooo
lol
game over fuck this shit
bench
bruh
ruck
mmh mhm mmh this is rough boys
mm
fuck
how in the mother fuck can we miss it by this much
pain
someone who can throw the ball has to playrun game meaningless now
why was tj on the bench that whole series

he smilin
pain
what the shit
am i going to wake up soon
nnnnnnooooooooooo
this is embarrassing
this entire organization has its head up its ass right now they have absolutely no answers
i cannot name a worse game i have seen them play im trying to rack my brain but i cant pick out a single one
we need the duck
i am honestly intrigued to see what tomlin does about this during the half if he does anything at all
fuck this team i hate them so fucking much right now seriously this is trash
jesus christ the entire team is feeling the aster like wow never have i seen such an underperforming steelers team
lol he waited too long he cant read this defense
ok wtf
think we could still lock down trevor harris
we cant do anything right on offense
fuckthat completion to johnson was behind him
what the hell is going on with ben this game
well at least he can catch
about to go watch scrubs the steelers are jd and the bengals are dr cox delivering an epic beatdown that will hopefully help the steelers grow in the end
is mike vick retired
what if we all lined up facing backward maybe this will trick our offense to go towards the right endzone
johnson just survived an assassination attempt
ben putting all the receivers in danger every play
juju drop
feel like im watching a lions game with a better defense
saved by the flag
nice job taunting tool
taunting
no huddle coming
awful penalty
fade me
it was a hell of a ride
has claypool been targeted at all
cmon guys i want to believe in you but do something
offense literally making it easy for this 210 defense
fuck this game
so are we trying for someone like kyle trask now ben looks washed
no timeout to save time steelers already giving up
at least the streak is alive
nelson been solid tonight
steelers not calling timeouts not interested in trying to get back into the game for the second week in a row
should they just run the clock out dont need another pick six before half time
best coverage weve had all night
alright time to see if 2 minute ben is still alive
14 yards per play
nice play by nelson
can we go back to pringle monday
flyin finley is looking like aaron rodgers back there
any chance fichtner doesnt run the ball 3 times here
if we dont try on this drive then thats us basically quitting
and lets just run out the clock
ol looking great
tomlin i attribute this to ben sucking
wow not even trying
you kids realize they will never bench ben unless he fakes an injury right
can this team do anything right
2nd and 22 run ok
im turning this shit off if they wont sit ben act like you care and want to win
did he know he was running the ball what was that
5 total passing yards
wtf whos watching the clock
why the fuck are you running out of bounds
way to stop the clock
this fucking team
that was bens longest completion of the evening
tell em louis

is this faceoff
removed
offense needs a complete overhaul no identity
hop in mfer 2nd half come back ride begins now
fuck it pick 6
this offense is hopeless if ben has the pocket and open receivers but hes forcing it elsewhere or simply cannot put it on them were still doing draw play on and forever but yea its juju dancing thats to blame
any news on ebron
yea fucking right ben
merry christmas
just kidding guys thats be pretty cool though right
be is still in pain
lol
oof starting up just as great as he finished up
certainly mupet night football
tomlin living in his fears
big al big fuckin sucks
ohhhh here we go just keep doing the same thing guys it will work eventually s
the post was wide open again
what the fuck is going on
wait i was told ben had his sweats on and helmet in his hand
does villanueva suck
jesus christ almost picked
for crying out loud cant even get 3 yard
is it me or have the refs been giving us awful spots all game
need better play calls
carl lawson is soning big al rn
carried by benny fucking snell lol
need urgency
this spots are terrible
hooray another 3rd and short
theres zero chance ben comes back next year he knows hes done
the way ben looks the last few games idk if i want him to come back
this offense wont survive the wildcard game
seriously please bring mason out im not saying he is normally better than ben but sometimes there needs to be a spark and ben has been in a slump since the loss a few weeks ago
jesus christ finally lmao
fucking finally
lawson woke up today and chose to eat
no more fucking sweeps to the kid
just like that
lets goooo
we winning
bubble time bay be
oh well thats better
what
alright lets start the show
thank god

show life offense make this be worth it
they had everything going their way then that drive they jammed it down the steelers throat
now we need the offense to play really good which means we have next to no hope this sucks
lmao
mute
sorry but running is fucking useless right now
i dont think theres enough time left to do these runs
down 14 in the fourth and thats the first time tonight we run it on the first two downs lmao
please just start chucking the ball
god fucking damnit our play calling is so fucking stupid
whats the aversion to play action
back to run run passfade me
time to go pass pass pass and fichtner decides now we should be running 2 of 3 playa
commitment to the run now
ah the fichtner special
why do they keep subbing out gray he has looked good
just glad to see people catching the ball and not dancing behind the first down marker and actually getting the first down
this game isnt over yet
wow look just a couple of intermediate passes and the underneath stuff actually opens up
nice hit by snell there
hurry up we are running out of time
wtf is with big bens arm
fucking hell ben wtf are you doing
thank fuck
gotta score before it hits under 5
ben
lol
got extremely lucky
whift
nice throw ben lmao
thats why he plays corner
can we sign one of those kids to play wideout
just get the first down please dont go deep
bengals will give them that shit bengals are protecting the goal line and nothing else
move your asses jesus

oline once again gets dominated on an obvious run play
need to start saving time now because we dont make big plays we need to kill their offense quick so that ben can dink and dunk down the field
go for it fuck it
randy you fucking dipshit stop running on 3rd and short with benny snell
jesus christ pouncey and decastro for destroyed so bad they tripped jc pulling behind them

ben couldnt get the game winning drive last week lets see if he can get the game tieing
i believe
man wtf
not a great start to this drive
lol
ugh
lets not try and get the first down
i like claypool and all but this man needs some body control ball is underthrown and hes leaning away instead of trying to come to the ball
so are we trying for a 1st or are we fishing for a dpi
feels great to have no expectations here
juju time
ah yes 10
ft over his head
fuck all this
welp its over
what an absolute joke
we getting any guys back next week other than glass joe
rip gg and ill see you all in the wild card
damn see yall sunday

what the heck happened to us these last three games
yikes
pathetic
i just want this season to be over man
well that sucked
garbage
recycle fitchner

yo juju lets get litty later after disrespecting opposing teams on their own home field
i love jujus attitude and delusions that hes good enough to be dancing on their logo before the game im sick of this shit man dude couldnt be a number 1 receiver if his jersey number was 1
tomlining
thanks to jujus dumb ass im gonna be tagged in memes when this ends the blowout that it is

thanks a lot 19
ben you gotta hang it up bud you had a good fucking run
just fucking retire you fat bitch
absolutely embarrassing i can see losing to washington or buffalo but it a 2 win division opponent this defense is garbage and i never want to hear them out in the same sentence as the 05 or 08 steelers ever again

were in some real trouble come playoffs if this bland offensive play calling keeps happening over and over
fuck this team absolutely no heart never met a bigger bunch of frontrunners in my entire life and the ultimately slap in the face is ben taking a knee to preserve his precious statistics in the loss fucking frontrunners
watt if this sub tried to be less toxic for once just give a try
did juju dance on their logo earlier if so he deserved that
bench ben rudolph in
think juju will post that turnover on tiktok
everyone relax this game aint over this season aint over superbowls arent won on mondays in december herewego
i cant wait to see juju dance on indis logo next week
ref saved us there
wheres juju to come do a dance
eric ebrick


tiktok boy


butterfingers johnson


and chase 40 of snaps claypool
juju deserves it for dancing on logos like a disrespectful ignorant fuck
i dont know why the bengals are celebrating like they did something ben just dropped the snap
ben is the biggest problem with this offense
hey maybe juju should stop dancing on other teams logos
holy shit that was a beautiful throw we havent made one of those all season
petition to change our name to the tik tok steelers
ben is fucking traaaassssh
never a losing season
lmfao at the mods rage deleting every post
fuck yall hating ben
ben throws a td and he points to the sky like a cunt
if we lose to the bengals tonight this isnt gonna look good on tomlins resume
anyone else not a super huge fan of juju still doing the dance on the logo after getting smacked last 2 weeks
derek trying to be tj
ben might be washed
time for rudolph
im done this offense is cooked its really not worth my time they are guted no soul

fuck you retard ref
7 points spotted from the refs thanks cucks
ben is playing like shit but i like the no flags thats our division and theyre letting them play physical football for once
fuck ben all my homies hate ben
interference again
i hope someone is waiting for 21 in the locker room after the game
not a steelers fan but just out of curiosity what do you guys think of carson wentz would you guys be interested in trading for him

ps i am not an eagles fan either just curious
so how is tomlin without his goat qb looks pretty shitty to me
its mason time
i turned off the game but following it on stat tracker or whatever

why is ben in exactly
i predict 3 and out here
damn so tomlin and fuckin randy must have ran a train on weepy ben during halftime im here for it if it wins some games again
juju shaking bengals players hands on the bench and shit fuck all that friendly shit bro
refs just kept us in it
big ben just fucked me in fantasy football
unrelated to this game but does anyone know a good place to purchase some rope

asking for a friend
ben sucks
cant wait to see what lit posts juju does tonight
on to tik tok next week
110 my ass
juju culture ends today
wow just heard juju danced on a logo is this true i just heard it for the first time just now is it true what is everyones opinion
at least juju got the tiktok in before the game
get rid of ab junior juju
did no one learn from shazier wtf
lol we are 100 losing this game dear lord
ben is playing like dog shit
send ben back to the burgh at halftime dude is washed up
dance juju dance
good call idk how you can argue it clearly a catch and fumble
steelers offense better go all out vertical throws stop with these useless dink and dunks
hopping over the line on 4th and 1 jesus
oh ffs ben is going to get someone killed tonight
stafford 2023
it looks like ben is not trying to get receptions but pi calls
lmao ben clapping this team is over
can snell run through anyone maybe
fuck ben im done you are trash
i think you have to bench ben right
bench ben for mason rudolph you guys are slow

i remember all the clowns sayin he deserved to be in the mvp convo a few weeks ago
get okorafor off the fucking team what a bitch
ben is legitimately worse then any other starting qb
honestly the only way the steelers come back is if they put mason rudolph in
maybe ab was right
thats the season right there folks cant believe this how this season going to end this is the tomlin steelers
guys its just a game go be productive with your time instead of sitting here cussing out a team youre supposed to support the team is devastated by injuries and our franchise qb is past his prime shit happens relax
fucking garbage coaching
we are watching bens last games as a steelers take it in while you can
pushed off but ill take it

been working so i havent been paying attention looks like i havent missed much
its doesnt matter if we win this game we are not going all the way playing like this
this is worse than the rams losing to the jets give up any playoff spot you might get its not deserved
yall need to chill out and go check out jujus tik toks
tick tock steelers the clock is running out
thats weak lmao
thanks refs
call a timeout tomlin you retard
i went to go use the bathroom i come back and its 3 and out lmao
challenge
failure ben youre dog shit
retire ben
bens been throwing bad footballs
remember that hype video pre season of ben throwing the ball pepperidge farms remembers
if randy is calling plays next week tomlin needs to be fired
theres no way we beat the colts
breaking a single gunshot was heard in the steelers locker room on another note qb ben roethlisburger will not be starting in the second half and left to go home early
how do yall feel about jujus dancing tradition
all you people saying ben sucks you realize hes had an average of like 3 seconds before pressure all night right how the fuck can you expect him to go through his reads with the defense in his face before the receivers even hit their breaks ben had some shitty throws but this loss isnt on his shoulders the offensive line needs to step up
bruh what am i watching what happened to you guys
incoming 3 and out on first possession
question who is your daddy and what does he do

the bengals big ben and he plays quarterback for the pittsburgh steelers
lmao 3 and out
3 and out thanks ben for being ass
pain
terrible under throw
oh fuck
just tuned in kill me
watt down
derek just needs some cbd cream and hell be right back in
you see watt sticking his arms in the air after the hit not a good sign


lol wtf ben
ben needs to hang it up after this year
its not even enjoyable to watch us play anymore
what would it take for people to admit bens arm is spent
well if this is how we are gonna play its probably not even worth talking about the post season
a first down on this upcoming possession will be a moral victory
yea goodnight yall
wtf is that nonsense in the end zone i get celebrating on a great play but that wasnt a great play it was pure luck
at least it wasnt a 3 and out lol
i want to fucking die
this is a one and done team
take a deep shot
al is a terrible ol
did tomlin even prep this team
bens arm is gone
ben should have 3 turnovers lol
diontae just watching like duuur o0
why cant we have a quarterback with and arm like jim finley or jake whoever this nameless bastard is
are we allowed to ask about streams
anyone who thinks ben is still an elite qb is a clown
ben is washed my dudes hes gonna be a pick machine
uhhh targeting
thats a fumble
bench ben
look at me points to eyes

were the jets now
right near the logo i can see the headlines already lol
the non lous riddick announcer is a fucking twat
id take landry jones over this right now honestly
that sucked but was bound to happen cant dance on logos and not get fucked
imagine if burrow was playing
boo boo shoester antonio brown
and for fuck sake juju stop dancing on the opponents team icon on fucking tiktok when youre playing like horseshit these guys act like going 120 was an award in itself love juju but looks like a total dumbass right now embarrassed for him
guess i am goin to work hungover tomorrow
man im so fed up just angry on how our offense is so predicable can we just do something out of the ordinary and call beast mode to help us survive the playoffs
hey guys duck isnt on the fucking roster stop asking for him

rudolph should be the one coming in
that that that that that thats all folks
we know tomlin can build a great offense
we know tomlin can build a great defense
throw to juju he can do it
thats a terrible spot
wow that was a terrible spot
dude look at chase
ben mason rudolph roethlisberger
what is bens decision making like its so bad throwing downfield does nothing if youre always throwing it to the wrong guy
ben trying to kill our fucking receivers
i think theres more people in these game threads when the team is playing poorly that seems strange to me
ben is just throwing to whoever is covered the most wtf is going on he paid off or not giving a shit just weird
and ben is due how much next year and our future is rudolph should be a fun next few years
ben 411 for 5
at what point do we turn the game off
its ok steelers you can take your time
we always play like crap against our rivals
lets not count ben and the offense out yet for the season you guys really want rudolph for the playoffs you really think he gives us the best chance to win give me a break
lol this team sucks
what a pass
bench him now
fucking sit his ass
i really hope the reports about ben coming back are false dont go down like eli be better ben
pull him
put mason in smdh
mason time
first ball ben throws with velocity except its to the wrong team i need a drink
didnt this fucker just sign a 1 year contract today
fuck these scumbag refs
which is his bad knee is it his plant foot
all talk all talk
ok thats game lol hope they can win another game this year but im not seeing it right now
where my ben defending homies at
this is awful
fall off after losing 1 game
is it wrong to start rooting for bengals to win this game lifetime fan season ticket holder but wtf is going on here which team here is 102
l
poorly coached team being led by a qb whos playing scared this team
dj not dropping the ball damn i must be drunk already after 1 beer also stop running snell already this is fucking sad
give mason a chance
how the fuck is ben still playing like at least sit him for a drive or two zero accountability inmates are running the asylum
what do you even say to this team at halftime its very obvious that 34 of the team has given up
ben needs to beat his meat already and release all his tension
if we get conservative and dont try to score here then we basically conceded the game
kneel down
a timeout you fuckin assholes
at least my buckeyes have a future

quick current ben rothelisberger or pre injury dak prescott go
idk what to say im just bummed
rudolph lets fucking gooooo
its amazing that this game is only 170 and a true testament to how bad cinci is weve lost either way either we actually lose the game or we win and while we spend a week of the apologists saying it doesnt matter if we win ugly we won and the coaches and the players patting themselves on the back buying into their own hype and planning their next dances andy reid mike vrabel sean mcdermott kevin stefanski and john harbaugh will be watching the film of this game and plotting all the ways to exploit our many holes

weve been exposed by the fucking cincinnati bengals and i dont buy for a second that our coaches are able to make the adjustments we need to fix the problems
we need to sign or bring in james harrison or some other steelers vet as a culture vet to instill some form of steelers football mentality
remember when we were all saying half of our team is injured and thought that was the reason we were ass
definitely got away with a push off lol
ok we got that one drive in the bills game too i wanna see it twice now
fuck this team needs to get fucked up tonight they already have a playoff spot if they end up winning this game nothing will change one and done fichtner here for another couple seasons tomlin same routine every game with zero adjustments bad attitude and game plan they need to get destroyed
like i said 1 td aint enough ben dug the grave hes gotta pull us out
why am i watching a commercial about a piss trough
needed a touchdown there but good to see some fire finally back in it
7 only come on
76 is trash
that injury is what happens when you continually juke for no fucking reason
guess we decided to stop tackling up front
thats game
im done clear house ive fucking had it just burn it down this team is toast
where is our fat middle linebacker still covid
they are going to get destroyed by clevelands run game
seriously fuck our offense need a qb with brains and vision
we should give away our playoff spot most undeserving garbage can in the league
im so done with tomlin cant wait to move on from him in 15 years when he has no losing seasons but still no super bowl wins since 2008
147 yards for ben how many does he need
we deserve to loose
holy fuck
am i smoking crack or does ben continuously try to live and die by the big play forcing the ball into impossible coverage time and time again i dont know why he cant stick to the easy stuff underneath
literally crawling to 60k
my eyes are bleeding
they do know its the 4th quarter right
here come the knock downs

thats 2 today that i can remember ben has been good for 2 a game all year
refs just gifted us a chance
ref saved the day
wow lucky dpi there
lmao our defense is trash rn have the guy in the backfield and give up 4 yards
spain is making tuitt look as soft as snell
do we go for the two pt conversion if we get a tuddy
if we get a td we need to go for 2
our run d took a massive dive once bush went down outside of the titans game somehow lol
minkah is unreal
why are we not going for it
we just gave a team their 5th win in two fucking years
claypool needs to come back and high point those types of throws thatll get a pi
running play out of the shotgun
lol nice throw
lol
guess that answers any questions about if ben still has that vintage 2 minute offense in him
okarafor is fucking garbage
we fucking suck

i wont be surprised when we dont take the division
tomlin after the game the standard is the standard
juju needs to stop dancing on the fucking logo
we missing ab so much juju sucks
hahahahahahahahahahahahahah

its almost like dancing on opposing teams logos fires said teams up
everyone apologize now for attacking me and downvoting me when i said we suck since week 5

just kidding you dont have to bc im sure 99 of you guys here agree with me now welcome aboard
i bet we move the ball better with rudolph not even kidding would it hurt just for one drive then put ben back in obviously they would never do that in a million years for perception alone but it wouldnt hurt at this point let ben think for a drive
yup theyre gonna lose this game

oh and juju is a moron for dancing on another teams logo grow up and act like a leader
this stuff really confirms that juju wont be back after his rookie contract i really like him i do hes a good charitable guy hes a talented wide reciever but the way he carries himself when not playing the game is not how the steelers work and they dont put up with antics especially without production didnt even tolerate antonio browns generational talent ass because he was a clown i wish juju the best of luck wherever he goes as long as its not against the steelers
youre losing to the burrowless bengals
refs mvp
claypool needs to go up there but another bad decision by ben with the game and probably season on the line dude just needs to retire
juju is a good guy but still gotta grow up a bit and forget about social media
while you watch this lifeless injuryriddled team just remember how we looked back in late october the nfl stole this season from us
prediction pitt gets pick 6 rides momentum into halftime come out firing on all cylinders and score a td end up winning 31 17
lessons learned from ab dont let personal social media goals intrude in the game juju no more dancing on logos and firing up opponents
how much of our meltdown the last few weeks has to do with the nfl screwing with our schedule due to covid could you imagine if we actually had a bye when we were supposed to
diontae actually worked to improve andjuju is still tik toking its clear diontae will get the deserved extension and they will let juju the clown leave
getting bailed out against a 2 win team on their 3rd string qb ishygddt
bens gotta be out out to pasture if we dont get stafford or someone like that the windows closed cant wait for this team to do nothing and sit in mediocrity until all the talent leaves lol
who is to blame for the loss today yalls defense is still very good is it just the offense
removed
analysts advanced stats suggest steelers arent as good as their record

steelers homers still undefeated

steelers fans with eyes wow we barely beat a covid ravaged ravens team

steelers homers still undefeated
ben and juju really shouldnt be playing in this game right now
bring in the duck you guys are dumb as hell
tbh as soon as i saw juju made the video dancing on the logo i knew this was gonna be a disaster

notice how everything went downhill when juju started dancing on logos
ben was hit throwing that you shitty fans

downvote all you fucking you want you dont get to imagine what happened
i dont want juju or ben back next year they are not superstars
well beat indy
also claypoool has been benched because since his breakout game vs the eagles hes been bad sorry to break the news to you all your best receiver that actually still takes his job seriously is washington the others are too busy blogging dancing and being clowns while swearing up and down that they wanna win
people seriously want to bench ben did you start watching this year

theres no better option ben can throw a pick for every drive for the rest of the game and hes still a better option than anyone on the bench

come on now
we lost by double digits to a 2101 team but tomlin is a good coach right
lol yall so one and done
every year we have above a 500 record just to lose in the playoffs or have meltdowns like this unacceptable to not have been in a sb since 2010 tomlin needs to go idgaf what you morons say
tomlin is so fucking overrated lol you think andy reid or belicheck would allow this to happen to the 2101 bengals
derek watt jut killed himself there edit in my defense it looked like he dove at the guys legs on replay we can see there was a block in the back everyone calm down
juju is a
lets fucking go were the fucking pittsburgh steelers we win fucking super bowls
im glad juju wont be resigned

fire every coach cut the entire offense
mason rudolph gives you a better chance
3rd and 18 and we through a 2 yard pass fuck
maybe the people here who got mad at people saying this team was done last week will actually open their eyes for once

im not a steelers fan but im tuning in at half do you think i should throw 25 on steelers money line rn what is going on
our dudes are gassed the o didnt do them a single favor for the entire first half
to the refcue
i cant tell if it was a dpi or not
i love this
worst team in the league
imagine losing to the 3rd team in football with some no name qb what a joke
finley puts on his mask to cover those teeth i get it
edit ben actually fucking sucks man hopefully he can get this shit together downvote the truth
juju with the drop lol
juju cant set aside his own personal brand inspite it hurtng his team and creating a distraction

sad man
go 110 and now youve become ungrateful
okay now put rudolph in
i fucking hate ben
steelers fans serious question what happend
crazy ebrons back started hurting after he realized he didnt get a flag
if im pouncey or decastro and i see juju dancing on another teams logo after tonight im dragging his ass back to the locker room by his face mask
mike tomlin is the most coddled coach innfl history
keep dancing 19 friggin asshole
honestly im so over juju not gonna go full mark madden on him but you have to walk the walk at some point and he simply hasnt for 3 years
i love how tomlin doesnt get any flack for not getting his team prepared everyone praises him when we win but when we lose nobody says shit its been the same shit for almost a decade

dude randy came in and saved us

imsorryrandy
dance ju ju
tomlin outcoached yet again
anyone up for a tiktok dance
juju was just having fun

ben is an mvp candidate

yall are fuckin hilarious
literally everyone besides blind ass steelers fans knew they were frauds lmao theyre blindsided its hilarious
no control over your players tomlin god this team is so fucking full of themselves
ben shouldnt play next year
this playcalling is so bad
im convinced were cursed
tank for trevor
we need matthew stafford
lets see juju dance now
thats not a catch lmfao clowns
maybe less dancing more catching
doodoo shit poopster
im not sure the bengals should be running their 3rd string qb into our defense no matter how weak our offense looks
the offense is broken how to fix
get tf of tiktok
litty
trevor lawrence here we come
sit ben
why do the annoucers hate is so much
like i said garbage wants to get chippy because he got blown up behind the line at least hell tiktok about it
this is not ben at all something just isnt right
silver lining is when we do get super bowl number 7 we wont have a covid asterisk next to it
well boys its basketball season now wvu has a great squad pitt looks really good outside of that head scratching loss to st francis
well guys is there still a chance for improvement
steelers being outplayed in every facet of the game not just offense the whole team is disappointing tonight but especially the quarterback
only the duck can save us now
every team that plays against us tries their actual hardest theyve ever tried
do you all remember what mason rudolph looks like like if you think it cant be worse
good decline 3 and out coming up yall about to eat crow
pick six and o touchdown were back
were going to lose like 2721
if clemson wins



itstinksbeingajetfan
its not just fitchner is ben too they design the playbook together im sure or atleast ben has a lot to say
lmao images being vegas and setting the line at 14 for the steelers and having the bengals lead by 14 steelers are straight ass all over in every facet
i replied to some douche earlier complaining about the naysayers about how we were playing bad against the bengals let me look that fucker up and call him out
tiktok
lamar cant throw
i think game is over homies
should have went for 2
the referees have been one of our most clutch players this year i would love to see this one get pulled out for a w
the steelers need to either put ola in there or sign harrison matthews or suggs you cannot expect to do anything in the playoffs with fucking alex highsmith
no effort by this defense when it matters
still no timeout huh
at least that should put to bed the arm strength concerns lol that was about 55 yards on a rope

this is on tomlin
what a bunch of failures
we have no superstars

corvette corvette
kneel ben you coward
you know what maybe fucking juju needs to stop dancing and start performing furthermore ben needs to put his money where his mouth isi took a deep breathand guess what youre sucking
god this team is such a stinking pile of shit tomlin is great at collapses overrated
heres a little love from a ravens fan just beat the browns and the colts and well see you in the playoffs
i love refball
ref bail out

yall saying bench ben sound like people who only started watching because we went 110 have some faith in your team
this bengals d is fired up i wonder why there couldnt be anything one of our players did pre game to make them play insanely above their potential right
ben is playing like shit no doubt but hes also being forced into desperation 3rd and long plays idgaf whos qb thats not gonna cut it
i love juju he was my favorite player at usc now with the steelers but one of the captains better tell him to knock it off with the dancing on the other teams logo bs
i cannot honestly believe the things i am reading in this thread i dont even know why i bother looking at it anymore
steeler garbage

tikee tokee
benny snell runs like a pussy
would you guys be happy with sam darnold next year
god why are all the primetime games so ass
theyre fucking dunking on this defense with a 3rd stringer heyward tuitt williamson highsmith are zeroes
lol we need the refs to beat the bengals

juju is going to be a free agent right cannot wait till the fuckers gone let him be a cancer on someone elses team

edit seems as though i am upsetting some fanboys sorry any douchebag that fires up an opposing team two weeks in a row for his own tiktok bullshit is fucking selfish
113 guys relax s
fuck it tank for a better pick i would rather get a franchise qb than get a better playoff spot
goodnight yall im probably done for the season see yall in the off season
how anyone keeps defending this shouldbesexoffender is beyond me
why isnt mason rudolph starting is he hurt or something
mark madden is right about juju
not a steelers fan but how do yall feel about juju giving your team bad juju so that he can flex his dance moves on tiktok
i literally hope we lose out and lose the division
the steelers tik tok star has been nowhere to be found all game one big gain when no one was around him for 10 yards and people actually want to resign him
tomlin is so fucking overrated always just standing on the sideline doing nothing while other hcs light fires under their players asses
fire fichtner and tomlin this is bad the steelers would lose to the god damn jets right now
hahahahahahahahaahahaha
our defensive line was worse then ben tonight and i cannot believe im typing that
big ben mvp

tomlin is a great coach ben is mvp number 1 defense i never wanna hear that ever again
juju dancing on the logo again reminder hes still a child
where all the bootlickers at tonight
ben need to retire and the steelers need to trade up for trey lance he cant make the easy throws 15 yards downfield
this is just proof tomlin is a top 3 coach in the nfl like idiots were saying after we got lucky a trillion times earlier in the year
tomlin is the most overrated coach in the league gets praised as the second best hc yet we havent been to a sb in fucking 9 years
yea bench ben so a shitty backup can come into this offense i dont get that logic

when a run game is non existent you throw in the backup qb for a spark

wonder if cincy remembers that tik tock
i rather lose now than lose in the postseason
johnson is so bad after he catches the ball
that was a soft call but
the refs did their job time for the defense to make sure that their effort in bailing out this shit offense doesnt go in vain
would have been a weak ass pi call he wasnt catching that ball either way
how can you say thats dpi the ball was literally batted away its not like the receiver was impeded by the defender
lmfaoooooooo
ben is washed
ryan finley is elite
gotta stop fuxking around on tik tik and social media and win
i actually feel so sad for ben man sigh
tomlin looks like an idiot patrolling the sideline get this dude the fuck out of here
removed
straight embarrassing ive been saying it for years tomlin and the coaching staff need to go
leave mike tomlin in cincinnati fucking moron
not bens fault yet a big reason why the run game is shit is because ben refuses to take snaps under center because he needs to dissect the defense for his own selfish needs

but hey big bens not the problem guys he has no run game
juju and claypool are garbage tiktok stars with no interest in playing football
2nd game in a row im done watching early this offense is sad and annoying to watch ill try again next week
juju needs to be cut or traded
this is embarrassing get that fatfuck out of there hes done i know everyone likes to suck his dick because he won 2 superbowls but hes finished and the longer we sit by and let him heehaw around is the further this stellar defense erodes this isnt just a onegame thing hes been awful

the downvotes are pathetic you folks really that goddamned stupid
fuck juju
juju sucks

dance on that logo
juju aint shit without antonio
ben will get the deep ball down give him oractice
so no dpi there on the shove
wheres the game i live in pittsburgh its not on channel 2
see we arent just dip and dunk haha what a joke
i dont think the block in the back was major the real damage was their feet entangling knocking his tackle out of line
alright lets see how fast we go 3 and out here or drive to midfield and punt
incoming run run pass
ya 2 yards
bench ben
big benwhat a stud
this team is trash
kars for kids makes me even more suicidal
this is what happens when you dont have a good qb shouldve drafted hurts
everyone excited for the playoffs yet
boys im on the road coming home not driving whats the team looking like
this team does not deserve to be in the playoffs
finley is the best qb on the field
second play in a row haden has tried to be cute and got out of position play the fucking game bro
honestly i would not be shocked if we draft kyle trask this year i believe one of our scouts was at the florida georgia game too sure trask doesnt have the biggest arm but i think he could improve his power a bit if his footwork is corrected
blew juju up
holy shit juju
fuck thats a fumble blatantly obvious
man he got lit up and then fumbled lmao
3rd loss this season where is this team gone bench ben isnt gonna do shit cant run cant pass cant hold on to the ball they need to lose
did they just run the read option with finley
dont worry the bengals will bengal it is inevitable
corvette corvette
when you see a third stringer making more passes than you definite time to consider hanging it up
yall shouldnt hate on juju for one play the fumble wasnt his fault and hes greatly improved on ball protection this year
when ryan finley looks like the best qb in the game

bonus finley is playing the steelers d and ben is playing the cincy d


the secondary is social distancing against the bengals receivers
seeing kevin greene and the game on the field tonight i miss those blitzburgh days this team just looks disinterested and going through the motions it is so strange like they have no heart
good hustle ray ray
two shitty spots
pi
yes sirrrrrr

ebron smart to get out of there early
the one time ben hasnt put air under it all night
this is pathetic wtf ben
sit ben
i havent seen a team implode this badly in a long long time
bens got the yips
this team is a joke
give me mason
bench him
goddamn it ben
bench ben this is fucking absurd
i dont want 2 more years of this
no linebackers no other pass rushers no quarterback no offensive line
bitch move by chucks too
so im also a notre dame wanna know how it started and how its going now
wonder what it feels like to traverse covid land to watch ur team lose

everybody dance now lmao
time to bench ben
but keeping ben out theyre telling the defense hey you dont fucking matter get out there and continue to get smashed by a qb who doesnt have your back

toxic
how are the steelers 112
lol thats why hes a bust
not calling a time out tells you everything you need to know that the steelers arent playing to win it
the fact with that they did use their time out on 2nd down means we have no faith in our offense
2 and 22 hmmm draw play while they have tos smh
the offense right now
we got this
yall gonna feel silly when ben drops 3 tds in a row
mason my boy
thats the pass i like to see
ben wants to come back next season

fuck that
he almost dropped it again lol
trash this game is over gamblers get your bets in while the numbers nerds still have the steelers as dogs we got this
why do ohio let fans in stadium
gaaaaah they cannot score its over if the bungholes do
ball game
may as well just rest everyone for the rest of the way no reason to get anymore injuries
what a great defense

gives up 24 points to a 3rd string qb
so sad we are getting lit up by andy dalton jr
rudolph with your nose so bright
run run pass 3 and out coming up
little urgency here
wow that was the game
foxy is a jinx
i know we dont have a run game atm but snell is horrible
holy shit we just got bailed hard
whatever
cant we challenge pi
chase plays deep balls soft as fuck
game over
wasnt even close what the fuck man
rubber arm

so two weeks against the browns right

and its probably for the division too
ray ray to the house
stay tuned for next week in a battle between the indianapolis colts vs the pittsburgh chokers
fu big ben lost my game in fantasy bc of this garbage
damn you guys suck is it ok if everyone starts calling you the fraud squad

juju will keep dancing and yall will keep losing
i need the steelers defense to do well for fantasy so far they look like ass
tik tok that cunt
this teams season collapsed worse than the twin towers
does anyone else think juju needs to stop dancing on the logos its firing up every opposing d

mike tomlin will not get any blame again mike tomlin just sucks
watt happened
lol im not ready to have ben as the qb next year ill take 1 trey lance please

keep dancing to another team juju take ben with you
talk all the shit you want but remember you gotta get on the field with us
big ben is the worst qb in the afc north and the steelers are an average team
bailed out
wheres all the dumb yinzers that want to sign juju
why would ben allow the defense to miss so many tackles bench him
zack taylor mike tomlin
removed
ab is still better than juju thats sad juju aint nothing without ab

this organization is clueless at this point they blow their 1st round pick on minkah and then get claypool offensive line should have been the top priority an average defense and an average offense can win games hell the chiefs have an average at best defense with an excellent offense and look at them

too much focusing in the wrong places this team lacks balance

removed
this team stinks
hahahah can someone make a tick tock of that
thatll teach juju to stop dancing at centerfield
clang goes jujus hands
that was a bail out call the offense didnt earn that
removed
removed
this falls on tomlin garbage coach
injure them please
juju honestly deserves it for dancing on the logo id try and kill him every play too
removed
ive been saying since the washington game that this team is not nearly as good as their record suggests and this is just proving my point this is a one and done playoff team that gets blown out by an actual contender in the playoffs
and ben wants to come back next season
ben looks like asscheeks
145 pt favs
my dudes i know things look dire right now but theres not a person here who doesnt know that the steelers are slow starters we all have seen pittsburgh hang on through three quarters and then turn it on in the fourth and find a way to win we got this its the fucking bengals here we go
thats what happens when you still keep dancing on the logos but not doing much else

that was a good hit
ok so juju karma is now even he paid his due lets see what we can do now
they need to light a fire under ben and juju bench em both at least for this quarter
somehow itll be finchtners fault that ben threw into triple coverage with 11 breaking wide the fuck open
have to pull ben now
bench ben
we got too cocky steelers bros
so many over reactions in this threat its absurd

edit we should not fire tomlin ben does not need to retire solely because of this performance calm down its bad but it doesnt mean fire tomlin and ben has to retire
lol did nothing with that flag
so nice to have so many level headed people in this thread

removed
how the fuck are they kicking fgs

jesus
removed
heyward is so overrated

anyone else think this would be the perfect game for the offense to change it up and go with a different style against a bad team or do they stick to there guns and play the short game and rely on the defense as usual
why would you change anything we won 11 games with my signature run run 2 yard pass punt every other drive randy fichtner probably
idk i think we come out with a different look tonight i think claypool definitely gets more than 2 targets over 30 yards and i believe we will definitely see a james washington long ball but hopefully we can figure out the run game and play a good all around game and not just rely on the defense
sticking to their guns but theyve run out of ammo
tomlin needs to play the tom cruise rant in the locker room
thoughts from the game i think they did change it up a bit turnovers have killed them and i just dont think ben can bomb it anymore and have to play to that due to the turnovers this game yes i know two werent on him but every deep ball he threw looked awful

who de think they gonna beat



this didnt age well
they probably do have an easy win with our offense
this didnt age well
someone needs to give ben some porno mags and buds now
it looks like they just might have one
we literally lose every time i see these posted
i actually laughed lol that was funny
this post aged like milk
yall really need to stop playing off these easy teams
delete post
everytime hes done this hes struggled and we have struggled not saying its his fault but the circumstances dont help
they do
looked like an easy win to me
thinking right on track so far

ironic since ben threw that game away just like that ball over diontae
hahhahaa fucking doofus steeler fans

aged terrible mate great post
lost to a third string quarterback

claypooldiontae
i need claypool and ebron to have big games my fantasy team came to picking up players off waivers and they were still available
okay no because i need diontae to outscore ebron in fantasy by 17 so im going with diontae and ebron busts
well i got diontae and claypool in my captain spots im fading big ben because i feel like the receivers will score more plus big ben costs to much

maybe you could use it to burn our offensive playbook
thats fucking sweet dude never let her go huge zippo collector market out there limited edition stuff is top of the line
that looks dope af
thats sic
i love how the brand name is how many points weve scored against the bengals
nice lighter i like the idea of zippo lighters until the lighter fluid leaks out in your pants pockets and gives you mild chemical burns on your upper thigh

but if i had that one id try figure out a work around
thatisawesome
pretty badass
looks awesome mind me asking where she got it
nice shes definitely a keeper youre lucky to have her
thats totally awesome dude i have been to the zippo factory and museum many times because they were a customer of mine and i just love the bradford pennsylvania area congrats to you and you obviously have a keeper for a girlfriend

now immediately use it to light a fire under big bens ass
damn thats hardi want one now
the future of that zippo looks brighter than our chances of winning a playoff game
ugly af

glad he walked off not gonna lie i had a little shazier flashback when he was stuck on the ground for a sec
i started watching after he got hurt how bad was it
when i saw those stiff hands above the chest i was so scared thats a huge sign of unconsciousness and likely a severe concussion feel better derek
prayers lol

removed

removed

amateur hour
i mean its pretty clear its ben whether hes hurt or what have it hes playing terrible
we deserve to lose tbh
what has happened to ben and his deep and mid ranged passes they are either underthrown or have nothing on it

we need to address in free agency or the draft
absolutely pathetic between the game plan and the lack of execution on the field we just look awful ive never seen so many third and long from this team
ben is trash he fixates on too many players he is only throwing to mainly washington and johnson both have dropped many passes jujus childish dancing on logos is disrespectful every time he has weve lost where is tomlin in all of this to tell them to get their shit together ben is broken when i found out that he wants to play in 2021 i just said why ben isnt good hes injured and broken he isnt the same its time to move on
honestly this cant be any worse of a start offensively just horrendous
fucking embarrassing honestly they are looking like how everyone has been talking about em all year
both teams suck and im not even surprised anymore
ben sucks this is a joke
are getting the crap kicked out of them on offense
they are little boys getting bullied
what the actual fuck is happening
a 10 posession 1st qtr ten score30
can we fire coaches midgame asking for a friend
how didnt we pick leveon back up
until something drastically changes i am rooting for the bills this team does not deserve to be anywhere near the playoffs if i was a wild card team i would be doing whatever it took to play pittsburgh in the first round


removed
why does it matter
i think that spot is the least of our worries my man

removed

dude no one cares
removed
johnson hasnt dropped anything tonight
are you watching the same game im watching none of the passes to him have been even close to on target
ben cant throw to them anyway so
ben needs benched for his own good
big ben sucks
ugh i now agree with you all fack
johnson hasnt even had a chance ro drop the ball today
juju just got blown up and hes soft so you can scratch him off the list

removed
removed
big picture hes sucking alot of money from us we cant afford to draft his replacement need ol
he has to retire i cant remember the last time he completed a pass for more than 45 yards we can deal with the dead cap space next year we will still be better off than with ben at this point

you guys are fucking ridiculous first and last time i come to this sub during a game seeya next week
stfu
qb and rb for sure
soft boy juju just got blown up and fumbled the ball away dont forget that too

team isnt that good overall ngl our defense is all that matters
ben is playing like trash
hes been under throwing the ball and theres just no zip all around hes almost been picked atleast twice because of it
i just lost hope with the offense but this defense can win us game by its self
the bigger point is its a young mans game now

brady brees ryan ben rivers

just going through the motion

itll take a lot for a old qb to win a title nowadays with alot around him

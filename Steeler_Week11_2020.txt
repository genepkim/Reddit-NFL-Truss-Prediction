Yeah his name is Josh Dobbs. However Mason was probably told to make sure we don‚Äôt get out of field goal range especially with how slow they got back to the line to run the one play around 25 seconds. The plan was to get a field goal and get to the locker room. It wasn‚Äôt a pretty couple of plays but nothing to lose sleep over
"Yeah, take the guy who hasn't played in 3 years, got benched twice for Blaine Gabbert the last time he played, and walked out on his team with over a year left on his contract."
No
Jesus christ no... legit should be able to bann people who suggest Kaep at this point
No
No
"We're cash strapped.

We're not looking to add veteran QB's seeking real money.

We're not looking for an heir apparent to Ben who's also in his 30's and hasn't been in the league for years, meaning he won't be ready to go right away.

We're not looking to add anyone who comes with baked-in locker room distraction.

So no.  Even if he's better than any backup we currently have -- and nobody has any idea at this point whether that's the case, except for his arm strength -- he's simply not a fit."
"Fitzmagic would be the best option. Then we could have Ben and Fitz as our Elder Beard Boys. That being said, no. Won‚Äôt happen and we don‚Äôt need anyone right now"
A decision I would have supported two years ago. But no.
"Even if you want to pretend like he's not a divisive stick of dynamite who has no interest in playing football you still can't see that he's and underwhelming mobile quarterback whos play style doesn't fit our scheme and got himself benched for Blaine Gabbert? You think that's better than a young backup who's been in our system for 3 years? 

I swear to God we're 8-0 and morons will still hunt for the same reasons to make the same arguments over and over... Embarrassing."

">The four players include quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, offensive lineman Jerald Hawkins, running back Jaylen Samuels and linebacker Vince Williams. All will be isolated for five days and are not permitted in the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

>The players will need to pass COVID-19 tests throughout the week before they before they are potentially eligible to play against the Cincinnati Bengals one Sunday. The players are permitted to take part in virtual meetings.

>The team placed tight end Vance McDonald on the Reserve/COVID-19 list on Monday evening."

"Depends on the cases. If they are one the ‚Äúclose contact‚Äù list, including today their 5 day period would end on Saturday and will be able to play on Sunday. A prime example of this would be Matthew Stafford from last week."
Everyone remain calm. We are 8-0 and we don't even know if they truly have it yet. Half the Ravens D was put on the COVID List last week and most ended up playing.
so the nfl is going to give us a bye week like they gave the titans right? /s
This doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre all out right? Just that they had close contact with McDonald and need to test negative to be off the list?
Josh Dobbs > Mason Rudolph
Its only Tuesday but i‚Äôve already turned off Sunday‚Äôs game
With the Steelers luck Jaylen Samuels will be the only one to clear protocol
Fuck you Baltimore üñï We know it was you
"https://ftw.usatoday.com/2020/08/nfl-covid-19-reserve-list-rules-explained

Players who test positive are split into asymptomatic and symptomatic categories. Per Packers Wire, there‚Äôs a long list of requirements for both of those types of positive tests in order to return. Here, for example, are the details for symptomatic players in order to return:

‚Äì 10 days have passed since first COVID-19 symptoms appeared

‚Äì At least 72 hours have passed since symptoms last occurred

‚Äì Return is approved by team‚Äôs physician after consulting with ICS and NFL‚Äôs chief medical officer

‚Äì Local regulations and requirements are satisfied

Players who are in close contact but who test negative need a second negative within 24 hours of their first negative, ‚Äúincreased symptom monitoring,‚Äù and eight days of daily testing."
Ugh. Plz no Rudolph
They were put on the list for close contacts. Ravens had 8 close contacts to Marlon last week and all 8 were cleared to play.
Can they still join the meetings through Zoom in case they can play?
Welp GG Bengals
God damn fucking fucks. Everybody else gets their fucking schedule reshuffled and we take it up the ass. Same as it ever was.
"Guys, we beat the Bengals twice last year without Big Ben, one of those times was a blowout. I think we will be fine considering the game is on Sunday so there is a chance that they can come back."
"This should not come as a any surprise considering the state of the entire country. My thoughts are with the coaches, players and their families. I hope they all have speedy recoveries and no ill effects of this terrible virus. We still don‚Äôt know the short and long term effects of this virus. There is NOTHING more important in life than good health.
STEELER STRONG!"
I fucking hate my life
"So do we get a bye now like the Titans and everyone needs to move their schedule around to accommodate us?
/s"
How she goes
Here‚Äôs a question. Heath Miller used to be Bens roommate on the road trips. Is Vance Bens roommate now since Heaths been gone? Do they even still have roommates with covid?
"As shitty as this is, I‚Äôd rather it go around the team now than in January..."
Nooooooooooooo
FUCK.
SHIT
Oh
Well we might get our midseason bye back now
"Well if we‚Äôre gonna lose a game, now is the time"
Screw you Marlon Humphrey
"Not good. Not good at all. Fucking reindeer time boys.

Edit: If Bince is out the Avery trade was clairvoyant let me tell ya."
I see we've decided to switch to Expert Mode.
we‚Äôre doomed
"Obviously...not great news. I'd like to point out that Matthew Stafford went on the Covid-19 list on like...Thursday, and was cleared to play by Sunday. Hopefully these guys are simply on the list for precautionary purposes due to contact tracing, and that they test negative for Covid. 

Basically...don't panic, at least not yet."
BRO WHAT THE FUCK???? WHAT THE FUCK BRO?????
[this is fine](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/96270714/Awkward-smiling-old-man)
MOTHER FUCKER
"Quick, does anyone have Charlie Batch's cell phone number?"
Fuck the Ravens and Fuck the Titans
If you haven't been worried about this since week 1 you haven't been paying attention.
Well fuck
Hahahaha fuck
fade me fam
F
**FUCK**
Pain.
This same exact situation happened to the Lions last week and Stafford was able to play Sunday. Hope everything comes back negative!
Well... this could be pretty fucking bad... No Ben and Vince against even the Jags would make the 'trap game' into a suckfest game.
Mason Rudolph gonna give us our first loss of the year.
"One more thing about the loss of Big Ben. The Steelers need to go out and bring in a more capable backup than what they have now. We all saw it last year and if it happens again the Steelers could end up 8-8 again. There is absolutely no reason for the Steelers not to sign Colin Kaepernick. If you don‚Äôt like his political stance tough shit, the guys a baller. I happen to believe in Colin‚Äôs cause but I also believe the guy is a gifted QB. I know there are haters out there but I say suck it up for the good of the team. The guys a proven winner and the best chance for the Steelers if Ben goes down. Come on Rooney‚Äôs, my entire life I have seen the Steelers do the right thing by people and the organization. Set the tone and do the right thing.
I will not reply to haters as it is no use trying to educate the ignorant but I will respect your view as long as it is not just calling others vile names or shouting racist rhetoric.
STEELER STRONG!"
"#""WE DO NOT CARE""

Next man up! Bengals week & about to be 9-0 ESSKEEETTIITTT"
RIP
Lets see what a rocket scientist can do to some big fat cats.
Trade for Fitzmagic plz
"That meme of us being 8-0 and with Mason standing in the background looking 8-8 is giving me nightmares now!

Although i think Ben will play!"
If Ben doesn't get cleared I just hope Jaylen does. That way he can run the Wild Cat all game vs. the Bengals.
"Just do what the Dodgers did, say they don't have COVID and then in the 4th quarter with about 2 mins to go say you got the more definitive test back and then take them out.  üòè"
COVID would be the thing to ruin our perfect season
"Ben is surprising, he's been extra cautious."
"We should, hopefully, be fine.

As long as he doesn't test positive between now and Sunday, he can play Sunday, given the 5 day requirement."
WE'RE FUCKED üò±
"Honestly, I'd rather they just sit out and have a bye week. I dont like the stigma of being the only unbeaten team left and getting every teams 110% effort every week. We have a .001% chance of going undefeated anyways."
Im so sick of COVID
Dont play Rudolph again. Had my vietnam flashbacks lastweek
even if he doesn't have Covid....Ben should be rested this week no need to run him out when we don't have to.
[deleted]
"We need to know what this means, if just close contact w/ other personnel that tested positive or an actual positive test for them does anybody know? This is fucking terrible.

Edit: ESPN article just says they are high-risk so hopefully they test negative"
I am going to pass away
"Quack.

(j/k)"
Lads it‚Äôs Cincinnati
8-1 incoming. Shoot.
Shoutout to everyone who downvoted me for saying the Steelers should have benched Vance. Letting him play/travel with the team even after he was too ill to even practice on Friday was an extremely stupid risk
"Remember when everyone was rock hard on Rudolph when he threw a TD to end the half against Miami, but in reality it was a 4 yard pass that Johnson took all the way with blockers downfield? 

Well let‚Äôs all hope Ben and Bince are good to go!"
"They obviously haven't tested positive or that would be their status, so they are likely to be ready to suit up for the game. Last week they did all the meetings via zoom so this won't be new for them."
I am in so much pain
"Looks like Ben has to isolate for 5 days. If we include today, he should be free by Sundays game and I would presume needs to pass testing. I am assuming he won't be at practice and will have to do everything virtually. I am wondering if these gives the Steelers a reason to sit Ben for a week to heal those knees. My only concern (outside of a clean bill of health for Ben and the team - as this is just sport) is that our whole offense has been predicated on Ben. We have very little run game."
Heard joe Montana is still in good shape lately...
"When I read ""We have placed QB Ben Roethilisberger..."" I immediately had a heart attack on the same level as watching our past two games thinking it was IR. 
I'm not surviving this season."
Good way to keep Ben off the injury report this week.
"Story on the Trib says it was Vance McDonald who tested positive, the ones on this list were just close contacts. So just following NFL protocols"
"Somehow I feel like this is the titans or ravens fault. Lol

Edit: jokes aside, I'm not terribly surprised as football has easily 2 times as many people as any other sport that played and being in a bubble was not going to work for a full nfl season."
"Hell, if these guys all take a week of rest, and we enter the following week a ""mere"" 8-1, with a couple veteran leaders from each unit having gotten a nice, solid week of rest, that won't be the worst thing in the world.  And of course, we may well win anyway.

Hopefully Vance will remain the only positive, and hopefully all positives are both mild/asymptomatic *and* free of any long term consequences (and those two things do not necessarily go hand in hand with this disease).

For now, not worried.  Though I question the organizational policies that allow ANYONE feeling unwell to have ANY contact -- or god forbid actually practice and play -- no matter what their covid test says.  This disease is too tricky, our testing is too uncertain, and this environment is too risky.  Err on the side of caution, and then be a whole lot more cautious than *that*, should be every team's policy.

We've got a one game cushion on the entire leauge.  Giving Vance a week of rest at home time starting the second he says he's a little under the weather, would've kept the whole organization a lot safer, and wouldn't have made any real difference in our attempt at a SB run."
"We have tickets to this game too...,,
Grrr."
"season was fun boys, i cannot make myself watch rudolph on sunday"
"This is just the start, we don‚Äôt know who else is going to get it. I‚Äôd be surprised if there aren‚Äôt more."
"Panic aside, Let‚Äôs get a real developmental QB sometime soon. Trade for Haskins or Darnold or Lock if you don‚Äôt like who‚Äôs in the draft."
It was honestly painful just to watch Rudolph play those few snaps on Sunday. Please god don‚Äôt let this happen
The worst part is that Samuels has been the team‚Äôs second best option under center versus Cincy
"Wouldn't it goddamn figure... just past the halfway point in the best season that I can remember in my 43 years alive for the Steelers... then this happens. Wow what are the odds.

To clarify though, I  am certainly not one of those Covid 19 deniers. This disease is very real. My father got it over the summer and thankfully recovered. My best wishes to these players and anyone else who  contracts this disease.  Do whatever is necessary to heal and stop the spread. Mask up, people. Consolidate and minimize your trips out of the house.  Let's do what we can to get rid of this thing and go back to as close to ""normal"" as we can.

...steps down off soap box, drops mic...

It just saddens me to see my favorite teams record/season being jeopardized by something non football related..."
"If Ben plays or not, they need to stop playing down to weaker opponents. They always lose to at least one team they shouldn‚Äôt."
"Please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this week's opponent including weaknesses, strengths, or info on lesser-known players you think will have an impact.

If you are a fan of the opposing team, feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above and/or ask us about the Steelers."
Want to solve the housing issue? Make everyone a Steelers fan... we live rent-free in Cinci.
"Expect your d line to have a field day. Before our BYE we were playing an all-backup OL that is weak even when we have starters. We're on like our 4th, maybe 5th RG of the season due to poor play and injury. Our own d line has also been anemic due to old age and injury, so Ben will have time to throw against a secondary that can play well, but is inconsistent due to the lack of pressure and a young group of LBs who play well but have no true all-stars.

Burrow is very good, we're just happy to see him improve each week, and hopefully he plays like he did last week and not vs the Ravens. But the trenches will be the reason you win."
"what have I learned, D stops run not pass, O can give you 26 pts a game. Yet will somehow find a way to win. we had success v Lamar because he's a duel threat and D took away his choice. Made him either have to throw or run. Bengals will be big-time trouble. They will know to protect Burrow and let his receivers work. gonna see max protect and 3 WR sets."
"No one's going to say something here? Is the Bengals run any good, if it's not then we can win this game"
"I was wondering how the Steelers secondary has played this season. Other than Haden, and Fitzpatrick can us Bengals hope to exploit a weakness since WR is our biggest position of strength? I'm expecting a ton of pressure on Burrow from the elite front 7 and our weak offensive line."
"I‚Äôm weird because I like all of our AFCN rivals to varying degrees, including the Ben‚ÄôsGals. 

Like we all represent the same division so I hope they do well when they aren‚Äôt playing us.

Anyway, the Bengals are better than their record and we often have issues with inexperienced QBs for one reason or another. 

This is either a Steelers blowout over Cinci because we come in angry or I think JB pulls it out."
Our best OL is our 3rd down running back. I want to believe but this should be a loss. Just don't injure our savior please.
We're going to be on Fox? Two AFC teams? That seems strange.
So are we going to miss the start of this game because the Browns-Texans game had a delay?
"The bengals are obviously better than the cowboys team we just played. It‚Äôs incredibly sad how close that game was last week. If we play like that, expect a 2 score loss to an actual competent QB like Burrow. Our secondary needs to figure its shit out, and fast."
Close contact isn't a full two week quaratine right? Both of us have players that went on Covid list but is there any chance we will have all of the back?
"The Bungles' arrow is pointing up, but just don't have enough horses to get the job done versus the Stillers.  I expect Burrow will get abused more than he's used to (and he's used to a lot) with their banged up line v. Butler's pressures.  I expect lots of man or creeping zones to stop the Bungle short passing game.  Burrow is decent at extending plays for a rookie and Bud will have to pop him a good one to make him think twice/make bad decisions."
Kind of interested in seeing Burrow. Not that I want him to torch us but he is much better than the record says. Dude is a beast.
"I honestly think we need to find a QB in the next two or so years good enough to compete with Burrow. Not worried about Lamar or Baker for the long term, but Burrow is going to be a problem for years if we can‚Äôt find someone better than Mason Rudolph to compete against him."
You silly gooses I see what your trying to do. Get inside knowledge to give tomlin! I won‚Äôt let it happen
"Burrow is much better than his record indicates, and our entire secondary needs to show up this game because he can extend plays and score. 4/5 of their losses were within 1 TD, and if our defense plays like they did in Dallas, they might be our first L."
Idk why but I feel like we're about to clap the Bengals how we did the Browns. Coming off a close win against an NFC East opponent we were supposed to beat handily to play an Ohio divisional rival. I also think the last three weeks will ensure that we try our best to not pay down. Even if we don't blow them out it'll still probably be a two score game
"It's more of a tossup than I'd like, but I think we've got this. We're finally back home, We rarely, if ever, play down to our rivals, and Burrow has been taking hits all season which means our D will hopefully not be any different. 

Even if we lose, we were still the last unbeaten team, which is what I had hoped for when the herd started thinning. Everything after that has been a victory lap."
"Please use this thread to post any trash talk about next week's opponent. Some people from their sub may come here to do the same, so please:

**DO NOT DOWNVOTE VISITORS FOR USING THIS POST CORRECTLY. IT'S A TRASH TALK THREAD.**"
Lol what could the bengals fans even say? Ooo the cowboys ALMOST beat you. We beat the titans better than you did! Actually wait... Are the bengals gonna win this game?
ya but what if we beat you tho
Mike Tomlin has 25 wins against the Bengals. The Bengals have 16 wins against the Steelers since 1990.
I hate all of you but I hope nobody gets hurt.
The Bengals‚Äô playoff win drought is old enough to vote.

TJ isn't gonna get held every other passing down this week
Bengals more like Bungals please laugh
Um... hi
Those striped uniforms are the ugliest things ever created... there I said it. At least when we lose in our white tiger jerseys it looks good lol.
Big Ben could miss the game on the Covid list and we'd still win.
Don't hurt Joe I haven't enjoyed football in years please not again
Everybody who was talking the most about why the FO didn't select jalen hurts as backup QB Rd 2 suddenly silent now claypool is balling out and we're 8-0
Cinci is about to be 0-2 against Mason Rudolph and I love it
Big Ben hurts both of his knees and wakes up sick. I imagine it is just a sore throat  and maybe some lock jaw though.

Time to be worried all week
"Well, Ben couldn't've started any slower than we did this past week so rest them knees big guy."
"Probably get a Saturday walk through and play Sunday. Brutal, but it is what it is."
Don't play him at all this week regardless. This is a marathon not a sprint. Both knees hurt let him sit. Plus we can flex on the bungles just cause.
"Just give him the week off, let Dobbs work with the first team and start him.  Rudolph is a liability   If we lose, we lose Bengals will think they did something special and we'll know they beat the JV squad.  Plus if will get that undefeated weight off their shoulders so they can go out and play."
So just like literally any other player. Why not just quarantine him instead of putting him on the list?

I can't watch Mason Rudolph since I noticed his chinstrap looks like a tiny pair of tightie whitie underwear on his chin.
"All I hear is, ""A little much needed rest for a 38 y.o. QB with a two game cushion in the division."""

Negative tests mean he should be able to play Sunday. So I guess it ain‚Äôt all bad.
"Fingers crossed he can play this weekend. Luckily for Mason, we don‚Äôt play the other Ohio team this week if he can‚Äôt"

I need Josh Dobbs at practice all week. Get Mason away from My Steelers
ü§û
"Look, I get Mason isn't very good, but why are people here so high on Dobbs? He is 6-12, 43 yards, and an interception for his career. He literally got beat out by Mason in the preseason last year. He wasn't even good enough to make the Jags roster. I truly don't understand it."
"Worst thing that happens is Ben's knees get a week to rest, we lose, and our record plummets to 8-1."
"Man, today is just going to roller coaster of emotions isn't it?"
This is great news. I was worried after our fine was the same as the Titans for Tomlin and other coaches on the sideline not masking up. Good on Benny.

"Nice pics! That stadium is really impressive, really wanna make it down sometime. 

No doubt the Cowboys fans can fill their own stadium when times are good. I wonder how many of our fans would still show up if we were 2-5 and down to our 4th string QB. Steelers haven‚Äôt been below 6 wins since the year Bradshaw was drafted.

Edit: I stand corrected. We got 5 in 1988. Knoll‚Äôs last few seasons before Cowher were the worst since ‚Äò72 and we were still not terrible. Moral of the story, even in off years it‚Äôs pretty good to be a Steelers fan."

We gotta pull Fieler for Dotson asap
Ravens lived in the backfield which was to be expected as they have a very good blitz package and talent up front. I was concerned by the cowboys and how they were able to collapse the pocket and completely stuff runs as well. Truth be told we have some older lineman and new guys rotating in. Hopefully it gets sorted out down the stretch but this isn‚Äôt the 2014-2017 oline. Ben has been getting rid of the ball around 2 seconds for a reason.
"Said it in another thread, but the line as a unit has been unstable all year. These numbers have fallen a little bit for the Steelers but the Steelers offensive line has been below average no matter how you slice it.

Short fields provided by the defense and special teams, and  the quick passing game has helped them to put up points, but defenses have already begun to squat on some of the underneath stuff and the run. If the offensive line can't do it's job well enough to cut through that, or can't protect long enough for Roethlisberger to push the ball down the field, the offense may run into some problems."
It feels like Decastro has heavily regressed.
The Munchak magic is wearing off :(
"Probably has to do with running 5 wide. Oline does a good job keeping Ben clean, we are like 4th fewest sacks allowed in the league"
"Call me crazy but I don't think the Bengals, Texans, Jets, Broncos, Vikings, Giants, Cowboys, Washington, Seahawks, and Chargers have a better Oline than us"
"I think our guys are tired. Tennessee, Baltimore was two tough games in a row. Would have been nice to have a bye week later in the year...
Love the idea of Dotson rotating in more to get guys a breather. Pouncy and Decastro are both playing less than 100%"
"Offense Win Rates through week 9. Up and right are good. is good? are good?

"Lol.  8-0, scoring 25+ points per game.  You don't do that with a shit line. ""analytics"" in football is mostly a joke outside of tendency charts which have been around forever.  Subjective analysis pretending to be objective. Bunch of nerds faking relevancy.   Unlike baseball, it's not that hard to watch every rep of every game in a season which naturally folds in to a sample size problem.  
Having said that, this might be Pouncey's worst season and Decastro hasn't been himself, so far. But that doesn't mean they suck either."

"Any sick player regardless of symptoms should be placed on the Covid list and distanced from others. For their own safety and others. This is a massive fuckup from the team and also, to the surprise of no one, a massive fuckup by the league's protocols.

The National Football League
"""What kind of morons are we dealing with here""

Looks at Randy and Keith.."
"I know I'm not in the popular opinion here but he gets ABSOLUTELY SHIT ON throughout this subreddit for pretty unfair reasons. He came in as a basically a rookie (didn't touch the field year 1) with debatably the worst scenario for offense (for those who have forgotten, we had so many injuries on the offensive side it was nuts). With all things considered he went 5-3 with the team. Here's his line against Cinci last year when we won 27-3 and tell me honestly if you wouldn't be happy with this performance if he did it this year:

24-28

229 Yards

2 TD

0 Int

85.71 CMP %

124.6 QB Rating

He's not Ben Roethlisberger, he might not be a future QB1, hell he might not play many more seasons in the NFL. But for fucks sake he's not as bad as everyone says here and he's capable of winning 1 game against one of the worst teams in the NFL. We're spoiled with Big Ben, give this guy a shot now he has a year of experience and has proven he can take down easy teams in his first year. He was drafted in the 3rd round and never touted by experts to be a QB1, but he was expected to be good enough to take down bad teams (which he was done) and which he should be able to do this weekend.

On Sunday if Ben does not play then Mason will be our QB1 and if you're a fan of the team you should cheer for him to do well and the Steelers to win."
Ben will be off the COVID list by Sunday I think
I don't think he is our QB of the future but he is our backup QB currently and should have our support. So if Ben can't go we should all be rooting for him Sunday.
I honestly am starting to think that it‚Äôs less on Mason and more on the play calling
yeah man i agree. obviously the coaches see something in him
"Let‚Äôs not cherry pick stats here. His second performance against the same Bungles was 8/16, 85 yds, 0 TD, 1 INT, 50.0 CMP%, a QB rating of 39.8, and a benching.  

No ones saying they don‚Äôt *want* him to play well if it comes to that. No ones saying that the defense and skill players aren‚Äôt good enough to carry the team to a win against Cincinnati if it comes to that. But at some point the ‚Äújust give him a chance to develop‚Äù argument stops carrying weight and you just have to accept what you see is what you get."
We know it‚Äôs you Mason.
Agree but small nitpick that Mason wasn‚Äôt a rookie last year he was in his 2nd season. I definitely think he gets more shit than he deserves from fans.
"I agree with this post. Rudolph is a nice kid and I'm not sure we've seen his true potential. But the next time he gets a chance to start/play, he needs to shine."
regardless of who our back up is... we live & die with Ben. It‚Äôs been this way for 15 years
"As I said on another thread - this sub shits on Ben and ask for his benching when he has a bad quarter.  That is a HOF QB playing at an elite level right now and they ask for him to be benched when he throws a few incompletes. Imagine when they see a young backup QB.  

Basically Steeler fans like to act like they are the most football knowledgeable fans in the world, but they are mostly huge dumbasses (present company excluded of course)"
I thought he did well until getting knocked out by a dirty hit
"Just because he's shit and we don't want him to play doesn't mean we hate him. 


The standard is the standard, and he's not the standard"
If he suits up I‚Äôll support him. Personally I‚Äôd rather see Dobbs given the chance but whoever we put out there we need
I‚Äôm sorry but I really think Mason is bad at being a winning quarterback. There‚Äôs something about his throwing form that I hate. That throw to Ebron against the cowboys was bad
"And Duck Hodges went 16 for 19 (84.2% CMP) for 152 yards and 1 TD, 0 INT, in [that one game against Arizona](https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3127051/devlin-hodges), for a passer rating of 117.5. He was good enough in that game to get everyone buying duck hats!

But the next 3 games showed why he's not the Steelers' QB of the future either. That said, if he ever takes the field in a Steelers uniform, I'll certainly cheer (or quack) for him again, because what other choice will I have?"
"I honestly hope he plays this week.  We have a LOT of football left this season and Ben needs some rest. I know a backups job is to come in cold, but getting a game this season under his belt where he starts may help get the ball rolling in the right direction."
"I don't hate him, I just hate when he plays football for the Steelers."
No. He‚Äôs trash.
No.
"Nobody hates him.  Except maybe Myles Garrett.

He's just a terrible quarterback.  And there's nothing ""unfair"" about realizing that.

If he starts, I'll root for him to surprise me and do well.  If he predictably doesn't, I'll root for them to yank him quickly and get Dobbs in there, and I'll then root for him.

I don't expect a lot of team success without a QB, but we're talented up and down the roster, so we've still got a chance.  Better still, it doesn't really matter if we win, given our current place in the league pecking order.  Lots of football still to be played, win or lose.  And our position heading into the second half will be excellent no matter what the outcome."
No. He looks like his dad owns a dealership.
"No. He earned the hate.

Now, he need  to earn back our respect."
"I‚Äôm with you OP, I think Mason can win a few games. I‚Äôve been a fan of his since we took him & I will continue to be until he‚Äôs not a Steeler anymore. I hope he keeps developing."
"Agreed. It is so popular to hate on mason. People forget he is a backup, comparing him to ben is unfair. I feel more comfortable with mason coming in for a few games than several of the other backups we've had over the last 15 years"
Mason was playing really well before he got his bell rung and became Mr cautiousness and less likely to stand strong and deliver confidently in the pocket.
"Dobbs gives you all the arm talent of Mason and excels in the mobility. Also, Ben appears to have taken Dobbs under his wing and relies on Dobbs to tell him what he is seeing from the sideline."
"Nah, man. He's trash.  I'm tired of the people bringing up ""5-3"" as if it excuses how poor he and the offense was. Cherrypicking one game is pointless too."
"You can cherry pick one game's stats, but he was flat out bad overall and was carried by the D. Even as backups go he's not even average."
"I didn‚Äôt even read the rest of the comments because most of them are probably shit.

Yes, Mason has a laser arm and he can manage a game. Wtf else are you looking for in a backup QB? Is he supposed to come in looking like Arod?"
People's expectations for Pittsburgh sports are dumb. Over reactions to everything. No one is understanding hes been dealing with fichtner up until this year. There was no preseason with Matt Canada helping him. He's probably been adjusting to a lot of new things. He got thrown into his first game action in the middle of a game for literally one possession.. And everyone is doom and gloom. We're undefeated and I wish he'd play an entire game to give Ben a week off for his knees.
Let‚Äôs talk about the game in cincy he shit the bed and got benched? He‚Äôs not a starter in the nfl and he‚Äôs a low tier backup
"Hell, he wasn't even drafted after the Reindeer games, Santa picked him up as a free agent."
 Kk
"There's not much to root for or be excited for.  The guy is noodle armed, he can't make routine throws.  Do we all want him to do well and want to win, should he end up starting this week?  Of course.  But is anyone going to be surprised if that doesn't happen?  I doubt it."
I just want Mason in there so we could hopefully get some close up shots of gene.
"When he plays well, the hate will stop. It's that simple."
I was just about to post something about Mason... he‚Äôs not starter or even backup quality. His stats look fine because he dumps the ball a lot. The guy is timid. He‚Äôs missing the ‚Äúit‚Äù factor and we need to draft someone fast! Ben‚Äôs on the tail end of his career...
No.

"I'm sorry, but he just doesn't even show any kind of promise imo. If his first look is covered, he straight up panics even when he isn't getting pressured. Sometimes it's like he forgets his legs are able to move. And sometimes he does this weird flailing thing with his shoulders and throws an awful pass.

I just don't think he has it unless there is some major changes to his mechanics, pocket awareness, and mobility."
No
He had a nice game. But if u look at his body of work. He is a career backup. I have always been a little higher on dobbs. Just based on his running ability and smarts. But whatever. We have some wiggle room

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

Someone had the balls to give a vote to M. Garrett for CPOY? That's rough.
"Unless Flores and the Dolphins get even hotter through the second half of the season, I think Coach Tomlin for Coach of the Year is the only lock. 

Kinda surprised Claypool didn‚Äôt get a single vote for ROTY too though. I don‚Äôt fully expect him to win, but his name has been in a ton of those conversations."
Tommy Maddox was comeback player of the year the year before being replaced by Ben. Coincidence? Who we drafting next year?
We gonna talk about how Derek Carr had one MVP vote from David Carr üòÇ
"The real question is, is Ben a lock for comeback player of the year? Am I forgetting someone?"
"I feel like I'm really in the minority for thinking it's dumb to vote Alex Smith as comeback player of the year by default just for recovering from a gruesome injury. He just got significant playing time and throws 1 TD and 3 picks and he's tied as favorite? To me, he is not the comeback player of the year if he can't play halfway decent. It's the comeback player award, not the ""recovered from the worst injury"" award. Performance upon return should mean something."
Why David Carr put out the only MVP vote for Derek lol
"Oh god, will someone think of the ""Fire Tomlin"" people.  They can't take the idea of him winning awards for coaching."
"Unless something nuts happens in the second half it'll come down to Flores and Tomlin. Looking at past winners, the ""team that comes out of nowhere"" narrative tends to trump the ""dominant team"" narrative for COTY.

My guess is that if the Steelers do not go undefeated, and Flores gets the Phins to double-digit wins it'll be a close call.

Speaking of narratives - the Russell Wilson for MVP narrative train is running full speed ahead and looks like it's going to bowl through two more deserving guys - how in the ever loving fuck does Rodgers not get a vote?"
"These selections are mostly on point. Although his play this year warrants it so far, I really don‚Äôt wanna see Myles Garrett win any awards ever. I hope his production falls off a cliff. Would be great to see TJ catch fire the rest of the season and put up some big sack/strip sacks. 

As far as comeback player of the year, I really don‚Äôt understand why Alex Smith is tied for 1st? He ‚Äúcame back‚Äù from a horrible injury but he‚Äôs a 3rd string QB who‚Äôs seen barely any time at all, and he‚Äôs played like shit quite frankly. Props to him but there‚Äôs players that come back from injuries all the time that‚Äôs part of the game, if you‚Äôre not playing good then you shouldn‚Äôt be in the player of the year category IMO."
He should have won it last year. It‚Äôs easy to be a good coach when you have Patrick Mahomes 360 no scoping it 70 yards in the air to Tyreek Hill.
Love coach!
I‚Äôm often critical of his decision making. Clock management. Losing to lesser opponents. But the last 2 years he has done a great job.  Even if you don‚Äôt like him. You have to begrudgingly admit he is a hall of fame coach. A super bowl. 2 conf championships. And 14 years of 500 or better reg season. If cowher got in.  I assure you Tomlin will.
Lol at votes for Myles Garrett for Comeback Player of the Year. Gimme a break.
It's about time
"Honestly, I would vote for Brian Flores. Yeah sure we‚Äôre 8-0 but we also have the most talented defense I‚Äôve ever seen, one of the most athletic receiving cores in the NFL, and a HOF quarterback whose only gotten better as the years went on that you can always count on to get your team out of a pinch. His influence has helped a lot with things like keeping the team focused on one game at a time, and making sure the standard is the standard and things of that nature. But what Brian Flores has managed to do in the past 2 years, turning it from the joke of the league to a playoff contender is amazing. I had the bills winning the division but I thought the dolphins would go at least 8-8 but most people didn‚Äôt expect them to reach 6 wins.  Now, halfway through the season, they are only one game back from leading their division. In fact I might give me vote to Kingsbury as well because he‚Äôs done just about the same thing in the NFC"
This team is winning because it has so many good players.  In no way does this team look well coached.
Am I an idiot or is the one Mekhi Becton vote completely unjustified
Ben comes back and makes everyone look good.
"Tonkin deserve noble peace prize, and many other prizes guy is just a legend"
"I think had the Steelers made the playoffs last year, he would have won it then.  Its tough to get the MVP type awards when you miss the post season."
But I thought he should be fired whenever the Steelers are down in a game?
"Why Adam Rank chose Mike Tomlin: There are some things about the Steelers that are hard to believe. Like it's hard to believe the organization had never started a season at 8-0 before this year. And it's hard to believe Mike Tomlin doesn't get more recognition for never having a losing campaign. And while I contend that winning eight games last year without ÔªøBen RoethlisbergerÔªø might have been more impressive, what we're seeing right now makes him my Coach of the Year."
Undefeated... Can‚Äôt even be unanimous COTY. Ben is playing just below the MVP QBs... Not consensus CPOTY because of Alex Smith feels... keep providing bulletin board material!
Lolololol David Carr voted for his brother. No nepotism there.....
"Tua has played not even 2 full games and he has more votes than Chase Claypool, the rookie who has more TDs than Deandre Hopkins, Stephon Diggs and Keenan Allen on 1 less game."
Duh?
"How tf is Alex Smith tied with Ben for CPOY? I get what happened with his injury, but he hasn‚Äôt even been good at the slightest"
"I would hope he fucking is. For to long has people said, oh he is good but he isn't coach BLAH BLAH. It's a damn shame he hasn't wone it yet."
when you get suspended for hitting someone who already had a concussion with a helmet and still get a vote for comeback of the year.
My Dad always told me that a coach is only as good as his quarterback. Look at Tomlin last year vs. this year and Belichek this year vs. last year.  I think he‚Äôs right.

Stephen A Smith is NOT a Steelers fan and idc how many times he says he is. I was happy when Ryan Clark pretty much exposed him for not being one.
"I understand him putting the Chiefs above us, but the Saints and Bills? He isn‚Äôt staying off the wEEEDD. Bills got busted by the Titans, who we beat... And the Saints have looked good but their defense hasn‚Äôt been consistent and they‚Äôve lost 2 games. We should be 2nd at worst. But that just means it‚Äôs time to prove the haters wrong"
Packers being here invalidates the whole list
"Wow... Chiefs I am fine with getting the nod above us... its quite reasonable for people to toggle us and them as 1 and 2.  Bills... that is very interesting of a choice.  Not sure anyone else puts them in the top 3.

Saints... ummm... nah.  If its a vote for which team playing at its best for a full 60 minutes, then perhaps the Saints, but we are also a clusterfuck of inconsistency and underperformance as well."
I guess we‚Äôll see. You know what they say about opinions.
Big Ben has turned his team around from 8-8 to 8-0 with him pretty much being the only difference in the team. He‚Äôs continuously got us out of pinches to win games. Minus his 3 INT game he‚Äôs having the best year of his career. Then Alex Smith comes him for half a game and now they‚Äôre tied. Could you imagine being Ben and doing everything he‚Äôs done this year and being tied with someone who hasn‚Äôt played a whole game and has a QBR of 32
"It's because Alex Smith has two legs and played football again.

I also think Ben should win, but [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6YylWiy2bRya9nJBPHkMl1wmWCs=/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost/public/XCKO3TMI7JC7XLBJ3Z62JMH2II.jpg) is Alex's leg last year."
"i mean the dude had his leg shattered, fixed, then developed multiple life-threatening bacterial and flesh-eating infections, was suggested *amputation*, and against every odd possibly in the universe has played snaps in more than one game this season. we all want to see Ben win but i would have no issue whatsoever with Smith getting that award"
He isnt. There is no mechanism to measure an award people vote on at the end of the season.
Because Alex's injury took him out for two seasons and it's amazing he's back on field again. It's more a comeback than it is from ben. Yeah we 8-0 and he has a huge role in that but still the thing alex is playing ball again is a huge achievement
the fact the smith is walking on his own leg is a miracle let alone playing in a game. but I get your point
"People, when are you going to realize that the pundits do this precisely to get you talking about it?

Nobody in their right mind honestly thinks that Alex Smith has a better claim to this award than the Ben. However, a unanimous vote for Ben on TV wouldn't make for good TV.

So we generate some controversy. 

It's the same reason you still have the Chiefs on top of plenty of power rankings."
Who cares?  And Alex Smith deserves more than Ben anyways.  We‚Äôre 8-0 for crying out loud. Enjoy ffs. Lol
"Comeback player is about the story just as much as the player's on field performance.

Smith's story is far above Ben's, while Ben's performance is above Smith's.  Also, there is no official tied or stats as of right now, its speculation for the most part... voters at the end of the season might heavily favor Ben."
"Well Alex did almost die twice.

When he took the field for the first time earlier this season. The whole bar I was at applauded for him.

Then this last week when he threw for a touchdown everyone applauded again.

so yeah for Alex to win this award he pretty much had to put a uniform on and walk on the field and it's his.  And I do not think there is a single player in the NFL who will be grudge him this award."
"Because Alex Smith very much could have literally DIED of his injury.

Being playing again at all is a miracle comeback - Ben would need to play at MVP levels to beat that out IMO."
"Yeah BUT Alex Smith had so many surgeries and infections that he very nearly had his leg amputated.  
  
Ben will will win, but don't act like Alex Smith even taking an NFL snap again isn't a big deal too"
"I would think it a safe bet the entirety of this sub would think Shazier would deserve Comeback Player of the Year if he had made it back onto the field even if he was slow and missed every tackle just because of the effort it took to get back.

I think if you could put your bias aside for a moment you would see it isn't the production on field so much as what Alex had to get through to even make it back on the field. 

It's one thing if you still think Ben deserves it, but if you can't even understand why Alex is at least equally deserving, there is something wrong with you."
people don't like Ben and for good reason
i mean if we win the super bowl i‚Äôm sure no one would care if ben won comeback player of the year event though he truly deserves it
"You seem to be focusing pretty heavily about the on the field production and not the ""comeback"" portion. The AP doesn't actually publish any criteria or anything, so all the voters are left to their own judgments as well.

Roethlisberger is obviously far more productive than Smith.

Smith's comeback is so many miles past what Roethlisberger had to go through that I think a lot of folks (myself included) believe that it outweighs any and all differences in production."
People just hate Big Ben. That‚Äôs all it ever seems like to me.
I saw that and I said what the f*ck really loud in line at the gas station - my wife had to point out how loud I was being.  This made no sense to me at all
I think Alex Smith's comeback transcends football and is pretty much a medical miracle. Wouldn't be upset about either winning because Ben is also commander of one of the top teams in the NFL.
"You really think a super bowl winning QB would give a shit about some comeback player award? Give it to Alex, who cares?"
Alex Smith shouldn‚Äôt be able to walk. Ben had elbow surgery.
"A ton of people already viewed Alex Smith as the comeback player of the year even if he didn't play a single snap. It's idiotic, but that's the case. His shitty performance didn't change anything. They think it's the ""best injury recovery"" award apparently."
"Coming back from that kind of an injury is impressive, but coming back and playing well is what CPOTY is about. You shouldnt win an award for existing."

"Between him leaving, the defense getting incredibly expensive, etc. - we are gonna suck for a couple years IMO. 

That being said, we can use the cap savings from ben to pay almost the entire defense and draft a QB to try and insert - could get lucky, but likely will suck."
Who do I want? Trevor Lawrence after we trade Berry to Adam Gase for the 1 OA. I will also take Joe Burrow for a 5th
Fitzmagic he is the perennial good luck chuck of quarter backs and he‚Äôs fun to watch. Unless we get lucky in the draft our next qb will most likely be an interim guy so why not Fitz
I think we could realistically get Mac Jones out of alabama. He's looked really solid this year.
"A Roethlisberger retirement comes with a $22.5M dead money hit in a year where the cap is likely to go down - so it's probably going to have to be someone cheap. Also worst place you can be in the league is a 6-9 win team because of mediocre QB and a pretty good roster... puts your team in purgatory for a handful of years that way.

If Darnold could be had for cheap I think he's the only real viable option (cheap meaning like a 3rd rounder). Otherwise you let Rudolph sink or swim (probably sink), and then get a top 10 QB in 2022 draft."

"Kyle Trask. If he falls into the late 20‚Äôs, the Steelers need to trade up for him. He‚Äôs as close as the Steelers will get to drafting a superstar QB given they never really draft in the top 10. Steelers got lucky that Ben fell to 11. Trask has the tools to be the next Big Ben. He is the same size and same skill set.

Kenny Pickett would be a steal in the mid rounds if the Steelers wanted to draft a cornerback or lineman in the first or second rounds. He may not be a superstar, but he has the tools to be a good starting QB."
"Justin Fields out of OSU. I highly doubt he will be there at 32, but if something weird happens that would be amazing."
Kenny Pickett
"Jameis, minshew, or trubisky/foles"
"If he retires before the draft then definitely draft someone this year. Our late first could get us a great qb since its such a deep class and waiting till next year could net a worse player even with a higher pick. I'd also want us to pick up a guy like Fitzpatrick(as someone else said), Darnold if he's available, or any older qb that a rookie can play behind"
Dak prescott.
"whoever we get, let's get garrett gilbert as the backup"
Mathew Stafford until we get a youngin .
"Depending on where he drops to I reallu like Florida qb Kyle trask. Having a great senior year, big like Ben and much more mobile. Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing them pick him up. Right now he‚Äôs the sixth ranked qb in the draft on cbs, and they‚Äôre projecting him to fall to 59th. This could al change obviously but I wouldn‚Äôt mind trading up to like a mid- late second to pick him up"
Aaron Rodgers.
"If Ben retires, we have to start over at qb. It would be dobbs or Rudolph. Too much money tied up that would hit when he retires. For the next couple of years we would go back to the late 80s and early 90s Steelers and try to get there with defense."
"We can‚Äôt afford Dak. He wants 40 mil and we need to shed salaries, not add. I‚Äôm very rarely up for trading up in the draft but in this situation, I think we can actually make a reasonable deal for 1st pick"
"If Ben retires, we have to go after Dak right? Our defense would still be too good to start tanking with."
"Stop pretending Sam Darnold is going to turn it out for the better if he comes here... hes not that good.

If Jerry Jones decides to fuck Dak... see if he would bite on a 3 year 100 mil deal.  Its a smidge more than his tag worth and about 9 mil savings from what Ben's hit would have been depending on how you build it out."

So 98 vaults the line while planting a hand on both the long snapper and Dotson there. He did this repeatedly throughout the game, so apparently this isn‚Äôt illegal? Why don‚Äôt more teams do this? Seems like a very easy way to block kicks instead of sending a guy around from the edge?

&#x200B;

Also just as bad on our coaching staff to have missed this, because when things 'of this nature' get missed once... a coach points it out to the ref with a 'hey, we think we saw this on the kick, could you keep an eye on that for the next time for us' and then it gets flagged."
"I thought this was illegal tbh


‚ÄúLeverage is a penalty in Football that is called on a team, usually the defense, when a player jumps over opposing players at the line of scrimmage in an attempt to tackle a player or block a kick and they make contact with a player on the opposing team prior or simultaneously as the ball is snapped.‚Äù"
Tbh he isn't jumping over them just between them if you look closely
Sometimes it gets missed. A similar thing happened in our favor during the Titans game. Minkah jumped the line and touched one of their players during the missed FG.
"99 and 90 are both holding to keep the guards and tackles from being able to effectively cover their inside and outside gaps, respectively, and 98 is using the long snapper and guard for leverage. Dotson couldn't close down toward the snapper to help block 98 because his right shoulderpad is being pulled/pushed down. 

The officiating crew chose to ignore it repeatedly for some reason."
"This is 100% illegal and iirc we were flagged for this a couple games ago which resulted in a first down which led to a TD but I can‚Äôt remember the game, maybe Tennessee? I remember I was pissed we got flagged for it."
"This isn't illegal, and basically everyone tries to do it. The defender can't line up over the center, but he can try to get in-between them nearly however they want as long as they are lined up correctly. Usually the O line pushes them back, we chose not to

Go listen the Arthur Moats latest podcast, he explains clearly how Dotson and Kam messed up a very fundamental technique to allow this"
I think once the ball is snapped they can use dudes for leverage but idk for sure - the person who can break this down for us deserves Danny Smith's job

But you can feel a heated -- even hated -- rivalry with another team and not ""hate the fans from the bottom of your heart.""  I hate the Ravens from a football rivalry perspective, but I have no personal issue with Ravens fans in general, nor the team itself.  The Ravens' fanbase (or any fanbase) are just normal, usually good, people passionate for their football team, just like Steeles and Bengals fans are passionate about theirs.

Objectively, there is no such thing as evil NFL teams and evil NFL team fanbases.  It's just a perspective issue."

"Last season, we were 8-8 and this season we are 8-0 so far and the only difference is Big Ben but pundits are not even talking about it. Heck, we aren't even superbowl contenders with an 8-0 record. Frankly it's annoying!!!"
Seriously?? Cmon.. he‚Äôs been good but nowhere near the level of the MVP candidates. 8-0 has been a team effort and heavily on the D in some games
Cause his numbers ain‚Äôt that sexy. Mahomes like 25/1 right now and they 7-1.
"Nah.. I love Ben as much as any Steelers fan, but his numbers aren‚Äôt there.. yet. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I agree that Ben is the reason for this year‚Äôs success, but it‚Äôs all about stats and wins when it comes to being an MVP of the NFL."
"You know why league MVPs often times don't win it all? Because the thing that got em the award is probably what was masking a team issue that got exposed in the playoffs. We don't have that issue, and Big Ben isn't getting MVP.

Good thing we look more like a Super Bowl contender than we have in a decade."
"Well...I would venture to say that it has to do with riding a motorcycle without a helmet, a bit of alcohol problem in his youth and two bullshit sexual assault accusations.

It does suck because the guy has turned shit around. And the worst of his transgressions were manufactured."
"Most of the odds have him 6th behind Russ, Mahomes, Rodgers, Allen, and Kyler. I think that‚Äôs pretty fair, considering the numbers of the guys ahead.  It‚Äôs gonna be tough to crack that top 3, but I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs totally out of the conversation"
hes come back player of year though
"Because he doesn't deserve to be.

Last year when they went 8-8, the line was always something along the lines of ""could you imagine if the Steelers even got *league average* QB play? They'd be a contender!""

Well, now they're getting a little above league average QB play - 14th in DVOA, 10th in EPA per play, 26th in completion percentage over expected, 10th in passer rating, 19th in AY/A... and sure enough they're a contender. But he's clearly not doing what other QBs in the league are doing."
TJ Watt should be.
If you put mahomes on the Steelers we go 16-0. That simple.
Because he's far and away not the most valuable player in the NFL.
"Why is this topic being mentioned near daily now?  Do people not understand what wins the NFL MVP?  

It's called individual stats.  Not team record.  There are quite a few QBs leaving Ben behind in every category."
"Never has been, never will be. He‚Äôs like Pittsburgh itself, his strength, work ethic, and production are just taken as a matter of course."
"This is a joke post, right? Ben doesn‚Äôt even come close to belonging in the conversation and if you think he does you absolutely do NOT watch our games"
"He's in the discussion.  His current odds have him firmly in the top ten, but nowhere near number one, which is pretty much where he belongs based on performance.

His numbers aren't going to put him in contention, so he's relying almost exclusively on team record.  If the Steelers finish two or more games clear of the field, and/or undefeated, he'll rush to the heart of the conversation late.  But barring that, it's hard to see a path."
I wouldn‚Äôt say the only difference between 8-8 and 8-0 is Big Ben üôÑ

"I like what JuJu has become this year...a sure handed, first down machine. Is it me or does he seem bigger and stronger this year?  He gets those extra yards when you really need them."
But some people still think signing Juju isn't a priority
juju would possibly be number 1 or 2 if ben had to force it to him but he doesn‚Äôt we have 3 wr who could be number 1 and james washington who is a great 2 and would possibly be a number 1 on a few teams but the way ben calls plays and does his thing it catches defenses off guard that‚Äôs why if ben called the plays the whole game i wouldn‚Äôt be suprised if we broke 50 imo
"In JuJu we trust. We have to find a way to keep him and we'll deal with picking 2 of the 3 out of Claypool, DJ, and JWash when the time comes. By that point we could have drafted another star receiver to make  things even tougher because that's just Steelers things"

Claypool is a BEAST
Week 1 seems so far away

"I forget the year but Jacksonville when Ben threw 5 ints. I can't remember if it was trap or not though. 

Worst Trap Game with a Win is Jacksonvillwhen Ben ran in the TD at the end of the game and the offense really couldn't do anything. After that game is when the team really started falling apart. 7-2-1 to 9-6-1 at end of season. No playoff either and not been back since. I think this years game will go better but I may be wrong."
"8 turnover game against the Browns in 2012.  The Steelers fumbled 5 times and Charlie Batch threw 3 picks.

Nobody remembers it though because the very next week was the game where Charlie Batch beat the Ravens.

Beating the eventual Superbowl Champions after losing to the Browns in an 8 turnover debacle is just Steeler things."
"Reading the top two comments makes me really sad... I was at Oakland 2018 (black hole where we missed the kick) and in Chicago 2017. Yikes, triggering memories...

I was also at San Diego 2015 where Bell ran for a TD as time expired and Arizona last year for Ducks last ‚Äúgood‚Äù game, so that balances it out."

"It's rare that the AFC Championship game could be considered a trap game, but in the 1994-1995 season it was. The Steelers were by far the best team in the AFC. They, Dallas, and San Francisco were by consensus in a class of their own with nobody else really even close. San Diego wasn't even considered a good also-ran after squeaking out a win over Miami in the divisional round while the Steelers crushed Cleveland. The city was electric, and the fanbase excited for the big game. That big game being the Super Bowl, not the AFCCG. There was even a song with lyrics something like ""Pittsburgh's going to the Super Bowl.""

And then they played the actual game. Suffice to say they did not win. Worst trap game in history because it came on the biggest stage and derailed their best shot for a championship in decades. Alfred Pupunu still haunts my dreams."

"By he way, in ~~1982~~ 1892 a touchdown was worth 4, a field goal 5, and a safety 2.  So the 4-0 score came from Hefflefinger's fumble recovery for a TD.  They must have missed the conversion kick, which would have been worth 2 points."

1.  In 1892, people who are 6'3"" and 210 pounds are nicknamed pudge.  I don't think that's even considered ""dad bod"" today.

2.  Heffelfinger's $500 payment was the equivalent of $14,200 in 2019 dollars.  Players making the minimum NFL salary in 2019 got game checks of $29,117.  Obviously, the players now make more, but considering how much the game has changed, I find it kind of interesting how close those numbers are.  (Heffelfinger got paid in cash, not by check, but if Randy Moss is to be believed, many NFL players do carry that much cash around.)

3.  The old-timey scoring system was whack.

4.  When I was a kid, it always annoyed me that the first professional football player was a lineman.  Now I kind of like it.

5.  College football was taken seriously enough even in the 1880s that somebody probably paid a professional ringer to play in a college game before 1892."

"If anyone uses the Telegram chat app and knows of a Steelers sticker set, please let me know. Been looking for one but no joy yet. 
Thanks!"
"Been watching his highlights , would seem like a good db."
And where in the draft do you expect him to go?
"This would be a very future-of-the-NFL pick, in my opinion. In some respects his skill set is duplicative of what you have in Minkah, but I feel like the way the NFL is moving, having multiple guys on the back end who can play that way can be incredibly useful and effective. The Steelers like to use Minkah in that robber role anyway when they are in Cover 1 and sometimes the hook in Cover 3, so having Holland playing the centerfield role behind him would REALLY make it tough on defenses down the middle.

With that being said, I think the Steelers fits at safety are going to push that down their board in terms of priority, so I don't see him being the pick."
"Obviously its not indicative of how his actual NFL career will shape up, but in Madden this year playing as the Jags I used a ""real life"" draft class and was able to snag Jevon Holland in the 2nd round about pick 13-20 idr exactly which one. Anyway, by 3 years he was like the #2 or 3 safety in the whole league and was amazing. 

Then I watched his IRL highlights and thought he was pretty good and as a Steelers fan would love to see him. I think we have a few more glaring needs we will need to fill early in the draft so I don't see it happening. I think he will have a great career either way."
Were getting Kyle pitts tho
"I'm a student at UO, so I've watched him play a lot, and I'd be so down for this. He's a ballhawk in the truest sense of the word and is incredibly versatile at least at the college level. If we drafted him I do wonder if we'd keep him at safety or if we'd move him to nickel corner. 

Dude's electric through and through though. Bummed me out when he opted out of the season, but it was completely understandable and definitely the right move for him."

Ain't happening if we repeat the last two weeks and have to play safe because we failed to stop the run. Hopefully Alualu being back will be the missing piece.
">  good to elite ass rushes

Righteous."
Not gonna get close to 7 sacks if they play the same bullshit defense they played last week. Seeing Tj Watt used to cover so much and constantly playing MLB is infuriating. Let him rush the QB like the All Pro he is. I really can‚Äôt stand Keith Butler.
Joe Burrow is about to look like Joe Dirt running from our d-line
If Butler tries to mail this in like in Dallas it‚Äôs going to be the same base D against five wide BS no sacks
Sounds counterintuitive but some of it falls on our offense. We need to get up early so that they're compelled to run more than throw.
"if we let TJ work rather than throwing him into coverage every play, yeah easily more"
I‚Äôm expecting maybe 3. This is trap game pt 2 and there‚Äôs no getting around it.

Jesus Christ we‚Äôre really in their heads rent free. I just popped over to that sub for the first time this week and literally almost every single post is about usüòÇ. I mean I guess when your favorite team is that awful franchise there‚Äôs nothing better to talk about other than how much you hate the better teams in your division.
I mean he isn‚Äôt lying on the Tomlin part.
"This pretty much sums up the Bengals sub in a single post.

Just a bunch of people sitting around sniffing their own farts and thinking themselves superior because they root for a historically shitty team. 

Analysis? Nope. Injury reports? Not really. Opponent discussions? Just post a 'Fuck ____' thread. Individual match ups? Just masturbate to a fantasy that is years away. Interviews? They don't do that there. 

The best part is they all go wild when someone claims to root for the Bengals just because of Joe Burrow. Bengals are just dying for some bandwagon fans."

"Try living in Cleveland, bruh.


Although I will say Browns fans have been chill this year. Can‚Äôt really say shit when we‚Äôre undefeated in week 10."
Hi fellow Ohio Steelers fan üëã Let's do this today!!!!!
I wear Dan Kreider‚Äôs jersey.  You see special teams players jerseys in the stadium.  I would say we are one of the fan bases that knows their team depth the best. Bengals fans aren‚Äôt allowed to talk about loyalty.  I currently live in central Ohio and you don‚Äôt see a bengals jersey unless they are winning.  Win or lose you see Steelers and Brown jerseys.  I even saw a Sipe jersey on a weekday near the end of last season.  It was a sight.
Holy shit thats just sad
"I didn't know that the Browns, the Titans, and the Ravens were bad teams..."
"Let's refer to Tomlin as ""Thou Dude"" from now on."
"Been a Steelers fan all my life. Never once called for Tomlins job, fucking amazing coach. I learn the names of every steeler who makes a play, and I DO love Big Ben. As a TRUE steeler fan, I know defeat. I know shooting ourselves in the foot. And most importantly i know the steelers can pull off any win if we show up. So, win or lose, steelers are always number one in my book. Best team in the NFL."
Ain't wrong about the fans and Tomlin though. Shit is annoying.
Something tells me that this dude only knows Ben also
"I'm 50

I sat in the Dawg Pound with my faced painted black and gold in 1991. 

I've been to a Pens / Flyers game in 1988 (before the Pens were really good) where Flyers fans were picking fights.

Hands down, Bengals fans are literally the stupidest fan base I've ever encountered in my life.   
Not even close.  It's an aggressive stupidity too."
"Damn I literally can‚Äôt name one other player besides Big Ben...

Someone help me- who else is on the team????"
Little do they know that I will full out ugly cry when Tomlin does leave and Pouncey and Heyward are the backbone in my opinion. Love this team through and through.
"Their wife-beater RB is out today, so its all down to TJ and Bud vs. Burrow, and I'll take our boys every day of the week.

"Who dey? Who dey gets knocked out of the playoffs every time they play the Steelers? Who dey has a packed escalator leaving the upper tier of their stadium (when the stands were allowed to be full) at the end of the 3rd quarter during a Steelers game? Who dey? The Bengals have been and always will be the Bungles. They might be in the lead, but they'll figure out a way to lose the game."
"I'm still waiting for Burrow to ""light up our secondary."" Is he not playing today?"
Being a bengals fan is detrimental to your health ü§£. Go Steelers!!
"A little bizarre seeing the Tomlin take, here, since the Bengals' fanbase and media pressure literally chased out a guy who posted winning season after winning season, and playoff appearance after playoff appearance...while coaching the fucking Bengals.

Marvin Lewis deserves HOF votes for lifting that team to the staggering heights of ""meh"" for so many years."
Check out their sub. The amount of whining about the refs ‚Äúhelping‚Äù us and the crying about how dirty of an organization we are is like every other post. We are living rent free and I‚Äôm loving it.

"Fan based gate keeping is the worst.

One of my best friends is a Brownie and I consistently know more browns players/coaches then her. However year after year, shit show after shit show she goes crazy nuts supporting the Browns. It wouldn‚Äôt bring me the same joy shitting on the Browns if she wasn‚Äôt a real fan. 

Just because you don‚Äôt know a lot about your team doesn‚Äôt mean you are not a fan."
"There‚Äôs a kernel of truth there. People around here call for Tomlin‚Äôs head weekly. However, I don‚Äôt understand how people are STILL saying we haven‚Äôt faced good teams."
The ones living in a trailer are probably the furthest away from steeler bandwagon fans
They put chili on spaghetti noodles so they can shut the fuck up and keep breathing out of their mouths.
They hate us cuz they ain‚Äôt us.
Fuck the tiger browns
"One time at a high school football game some kid was wearing a Joe Flacco jersey. My brother said ""why do you like the Ravens, you live in PA"" and the kid replied ""BRO YOU BANDWAGON I BET YOU COULDN'T NAME ANYONE BESIDES THE QB AND WRS"" and my brother proceeded to name the entire steelers roster. Then we asked the kid who on the Ravens he knew and he only named the stars."

That man‚Äôs been breathing those Jim Beam fumes out the river too long.
"It does suck living in Ohio and being a Steelers fan but on the other hand, I love it! I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about when he says bandwagonersü§£! I go shopping every Sunday and when the browns are on a losing streak I don‚Äôt see nearly as much browns gear when I‚Äôm out and about then when the week before they won a game or are on a winning streak(which is rare). That‚Äôs the definition of bandwagoners. It‚Äôs extremely noticeable too. I love it when browns fans say ‚ÄúSteelers suck!!‚Äù, like it hurts my feelingsüòÇ!"
"Tomlin has made some questionable decisions as far as challenges, play calls, etc. The main thing I can‚Äôt understand is why so many people are ready to get at his throat, it is after all the NFL. Most of the time it‚Äôs go big or go home and he likes to go big and I‚Äôm not mad at the man for it. The team wouldn‚Äôt be where they are now if it wasn‚Äôt for Tomlin and we should appreciate him more. Can‚Äôt wait for out boys to whip some Bengal ass today! GO STEELERS!!!"
Pff Bengals fans don‚Äôt even know bout the üêêDeaneglo Williams
Ohio shares a border with Kentucky AND West Virginia
"I lived in cincy for years. Nice city. But during the 2000s, it was more common than not for their home game to be blacked out due to not selling out seats. Say what you will about the Browns, but they have real fans. Cincy is fair weather as all hell."

"Guys.

"lololol I‚Äôm a Steelers fan, born and raised in Cincinnati, and they stay hating."
"Team has only faced bad teams this year.
Did you just trash your own team."
I've always found Bengals fans way more obnoxious than any other fans.
"We dey, bitch. WE ALWAYS DEY."
"Hm? Is this guy still talking now? I don‚Äôt hear him, or a third down conversion for that matter..."
When your franchise is as great as ours its hard remembering the names of all the greats that played for us üòéüòéüòé

"I have never called for tomlins job, I have never watched the Steelers win a super bowl cuz the last time they did, I was like 9 and was too dumb to understand football. I love the Steelers because my dad has loved the Steelers almost his whole life. You wanna talk about bandwagoners, look at half the patriots fan base that only became ‚Äúfans‚Äù after they started winning Super Bowls."
Ohio here. My browns fan in laws have literally made me not care about football anymore. They take all of the fun out of watching.
"Love the part of the Steelers only faced bad teams. As if the Bungles are a good team, lol."
TJ Watt is my fav but I really enjoy 99% of this team.
That‚Äôs rich coming from the fan who‚Äôs team hasn‚Äôt won a playoff game in like 30 years.
"Damn, sure speaking like a 66-35 all time."
What a clown
L.......o.....L
The tomlin part is facts though. I had to stop reading the game day thread because of that.
Those last 2 sentences tho üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I know more Browns fans than I do Bengals and they're a much more classy group of people. Basically the Bengals want to be the Ravens so badly they mimick their crowd.
Jealousy is unbecoming.
I‚Äôm not against going on their subs game thread if anybody wants to join
"Even in their shit talking posts, we have them admitting tomlin is the best coach in the NFL. They‚Äôre down bad & know it"
We got yinzers ready to fire Tomlin after any given bubble screen.
Well it was pretty brutal. That part was right.
Only yellow I like is piss
He‚Äôs not wrong about fans calling for tomlins job if they lose today.  The Tomlin haters will finally warm up their keyboards on that first L.
Psh. Do they not realize we also root for the Pirates?

First play: run up the middle with Conner. Probably try a short pass or screen after that. Then on 3rd down make Ben try to convert a third and long. And god forbid a screen actually works we‚Äôll be running that play for the rest of the game. I‚Äôm predicting we fall behind early and then rely on Ben to make another improbable comeback.
2 yard run up the middle with Conner as the first offensive play is a virtual certainty in this game.
Every yinzer thinks every play should go for a first down and every drive for a touchdown
or the one we all want 75 yard touchdown to chase claypool on first play and then we get vintage big ben
Is it just me or are we really not running that many screen passes this year? And the ones we do are usually successful
"1st play Conner left side.

2nd play Conner middle.

3rd play screen to Conner right side, 1st down.

4th play Ben throws it 180 yards into the parking lot. 2 yards past Claypool"
I thought CBS is the dedicated AFC network. Why is Fox showing two AFC teams playing each other? Does it have something to do with the game being flexed?
"CBS has The Masters this weekend, which takes precedence for them."
"Might be - I‚Äôm cool with it, though, since the Bills are playing at the same time, which usually means Western NY can‚Äôt watch the Steelers play without Sunday Ticket."
Yeah... it really doesn‚Äôt matter to me...I just found it odd that FOX was airing an AFC matchup.
I really don't care for Fox's drawings of players that they plaster all over every 30 seconds. They just seem so out of place to me.
"A few years ago the NFL decided that they were going to occasionally mix NFC and AFC games between FOX and CBS to maximize viewing availability. For the most part, they stick to their own networks. But sometimes you‚Äôll see them crossover like this week‚Äôs game."
They started doing this a few years ago. Its to maximize viewership. Usually starts later im the season as it gets closer to playoff seeding
"It is odd for FOX to have a game with two AFC teams, but not unseen. I think the whole CBS/AFC FOX/NFC thing is more of a guideline they use than a hard rule when they set the broadcast schedule. After all there are lots of interconference games that one of them has to take"
This game was supposed to be CBS at 1pm and got moved because of golf.
The masters are broadcast on CBS so it got booted to fox
"I'll miss Romo's astute analysis and objective commentary.

edit: just looked up the Fox Announcers for today:  Kenny Albert & Johnathan Vilma. I don't think I remember who they are.  At least its not Joe Buck."

It's currently just after 1:30 PM and the game in Cleveland was delayed. With both of these games on Fox we can expect the Cleveland game to run over and the Steelers game not broadcast for a minute, right?

"I think the PGH market theyll switch over to the Steelers game at 4:25. Rest of the country, no idea."
Use nflbite.com or sportsurge.net to catch the first part of the Steelers game. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna do

Idk why but I‚Äôm optimistic we‚Äôll be up 17-7 at the half.  I know we usually play down to worse teams but I‚Äôm feeling good today.

"I‚Äôve been hesitant on drafting an RB high this year after we‚Äôve spent 3 mid round picks on a row on RBs, and I think offensive line is a bigger need unless a QB falls to us, but maybe we should consider a Najee Harris or a Travis Etienne."
Thought Ben was gone bust out a run lmao
Steelers fans: Looks like Conner hype is back on the menu!
[deleted]
Shame we can‚Äôt rely on a run game to pick up 2 yards on third down
"Watt up to 9 sacks... Garrett only was given half a sack today... gap has been closed.

&#x200B;

Also jesus that slick sidline... I don't wanna see Burrow hurt from shit like that."
"Prevent defense is typically the bane of ever fan‚Äôs existence, but that is exactly how you‚Äôd want to run defense against their last drive of the half"
I wanna see a singing contest that really puts someone's skills to the test and their belief in themselves. Think you're the best? Prove it. Drink a poison and if you win the match you get the antidote otherwise it's lights out.
Haden is kicking all sorts of ass today.
u know randy was twitching at halftime knowing they haven‚Äôt gone run run pass on a 3 and out yet
Ben literally pump faked a defender onto the ground. Best pump fake of all time.
"Claypool is the next megatron 

Johnson is the next ab

Juju is the next hines"
I want the Steelers to drop a 40 point game on the bengals so bad lol
"Vilma: ""I WAS ALSO DRAFTED IN 2004 EVERYONE"""
Vilma must have money on cincy the way he was just crying
Vilma with a literal boner because cincy made a play down 30 points in the 4th
Baker Mayfield with a noose around his neck looking at Joe Burrow: First Time?
This commentator won‚Äôt stop sucking off the Bengals
"Hear me out.


4th quarter.


Nothing but deep pass until we complete one"
I hope I don‚Äôt get downvoted for this but I like Burrow honestly. I think he could become a really good QB in the future with more time and experience
"I return with Chinese food and bless the old lady's heart who took my order and included two sets of chopsticks and two fortune cookies thinking I was ordering for two.

I assure her and everyone else I'm just fat.

Chinese food is here, dogs and myself are in our jerseys, got a good Sativa ground up testing at like 25.5%, and a victory pre-roll on standby for tomorrow morning when I get off work.

Let's. Fucking. Go."
How the fuck is that not a safety
Conner isn‚Äôt very good
Don't you dare mention Rudolph
Another 3rd and 5 into the fucking bleachers
Dobbs seems like a good dude
Chase bb please be ok
Ben to Johnson looks exactly like Ben to AB when they connect
Watching strip fumbles in slow motion is honestly the best thing
Very smart by Ben. Give the ball back to the Bengals so we're closer to their end zone when they fumble again.
So we beat the Ravens and Cowboys by doing things needed to win?
I hate listening to Vilma so much
"Well, there‚Äôs that big shit the bed play"
Vilma hates the Steelers as much as y‚Äôall think Romo does
Why does our defense go from being lockdown and forcing a fumble to looking like Swiss cheese and completely confused.
Patrick mahomes is really good at cornhole
Alright we‚Äôre still up 5 we got this
Jonathan Vilma plz shut up
Burrow is legit very good. Hopefully the Bengals end up squandering his talent so he can find success somewhere else.
Jc isn‚Äôt an outside type runner. Why are we running stretch plays with him?
Can someone please...pleaseeee explain to me why. The. Fuck. Do. They. Run. Conner. Outside? Seriously wtf. It's never been his thing and never will be his thing. Fucking knock it off randy. Go eat a cheeseburger
Comments a bit negative for being up 22-7 at the end of the 2nd
Imagining TJ whispering to Burrow on the ground ‚Äúget used to this sweetheart‚Äù
TJ and Bud Dupree are the best pass rush duo in the NFL and it‚Äôs not even close
Those fox QB graphics are so weird lol
"Ok y‚Äôall we get the Bengals sub is bitching, just as we do when we lose like this, but leave them alone posting there is annoying and petty for us both."
"We need to finish this game with over 40 points. Weather isn‚Äôt ideal but who gives a shit. Step on their throats, leave no doubt how dominant this team really is"
Winning playoff games will be hard without a run game.
"For the rest of the game, the D needs to keep on blitzing.  The rook needs about 3-4 more sacks to truly be welcomed to Heinz Field."
Fox you fucking idiots. Went to take a break when shit was happening.
Claypool is the receiver Ben has always wanted.
LMAO at that CB talking shit to Claypool while down 4 scores
Watch me throw this over that mountain
Vilma so upset
I don't like to wear baggy clothes.  But if Tomlin doesn't look like the comfiest mf every week on the sidelines all layered up.
It‚Äôs really nice to see us beat the living shit out of an inferior team for once
Love that the party has already started on the sideline lol
The Bengals called a fake punt down 29 points so their#1 draft pick could get hit more times
lmao I love that the defense seemed to take that fake punt personally. If you're gonna pull some hoe shit at the end of a game that's over then we're gonna make you pay.
Is it just me or do we need an interception to make this complete
I actually am interested in watching Rudy play in a low pressure situation.
Mason looked good there
That chip on ben's shoulder has been our MVP for years
The Standard is the Standard.
Vilma he feels the loss either way I promise.
"No heart attacks this game, feels good."
"Thank you Steelers for not giving me a heart attack today. 

I love you"
That should be a safety?  It hit off him before the endzone
"So how is that not a safety? He touched it in bounds, then downed it in the end zone?"
"Wait, when he touches the ball isn‚Äôt it live outside the end zone and then he recovers in the end zone so safety??"
"3 possessions in 7 minutes, and only 3 points to show for it. Come on, guys."
"Hey guys, is it cool if I watch with y'all? People are being assholes in my thread."
Bengal took a knee to the head. How he's ok
PRAY FOR ELBOWS PRAY FOR ELBOWS PRAY FOR ELBOWS
"If these stupid networks don't stop making a mountain out of a molehill every time Ben touches his elbow, I'm going to go insane."
This has felt like the longest quarter in history.
The announcers are gonna run down on feild and suck off Burrow any time now.
"I love Ben's deep balls.....

You know what I'll stand by that statement"
"Unstoppable 

*when we get going"
I think that was bens prettiest deep ball all season
I‚Äôm confused what playaction Vilma is talking about on that Higgins pass
illegal pick but whatever
Was that not a pick??
"That's the ""legal"" pick play"
This announcer has been all sorts of wrong and it‚Äôs getting really annoying
JUUJUUUU! Idk how Ben got that off & threw it so accurately. Let's go!
Don't take Ben for granted Pittsburgh
Hella respect for Juju giving a fan the ball.
"Off tackle run from the shotgun: loses 6 yards

Fichtner: I‚Äôll fuckin do it again"
"Passing is working?

Let's run a stretch play and lose 5"
That was big them not getting any points before the half.
"TJ is killing it, Diontae is feasting more than fasting, and Large Benjamin is doing work. I love it so far."
"It really annoys me that he keeps calling him ""Schuster"". Juju Smith-Schuster, Smitch-Schuster or just Juju, but never ""Schuster"". Idiot."
Chase Claypool just scored from the Heinz Red Zone. We too can score big with Heinz thick and rich ketchup from our local Giant Eagle
Starting to sound like a broken record but Claypool is something special
TJ should've won the award last season.
Geez did this announcer put like 50 Grand on the Bengals or something
Vilma out here shamelessly rooting for the bungles lmao
McCloud is such an 200 IQ returner
Lol fuck the Bengals. They were talking mad shit before this game acting like they are actually on our level. Forgetting that we have beaten them the last 10 times. Hopefully those dumbass fans learn there lesson after this game that they will never be on our level.
My lack of chest pains right now is odd.
Teams from Ohio and Roethlisberger shitting all over them. Name a more iconic duo
Anyone who says we aren't a top 2 team in the nfl or don't have a shot at the SB is plain incorrect. We're incredible.
[deleted]
Honestly why the fuck did they even have Joe still in? Hopefully he‚Äôs ok.
"Bengals pls, pull Burrow, he doesn't need this abuse, he's going to be good for you guys, don't let him get hurt for nothing."
Post game thread?
Imagine being a Bengals fan üò≥üòÇ
"Ben: ""What if I throw the ball really fucking hard?"""
"So if power doesn‚Äôt come back I will have to resort to getting shitfaced in my car in order to charge my phone to keep the stream up.

This is the way."
Please can we make a rookie QB look like a rookie QB today?
[deleted]
"'Bengals had a 3 and out...'  

&#x200B;

No, no they didn't... get some better announcing here."
Yo my toup√®e just blew across the field
How was that not a safety?
Lmao I love how they won't even show the replay to see if it was actually a safety.
Announcers just going to ignore not telling us why that wasn't a safety? lol
"AJ green and fitzgerald have to be the best receivers held back by the teams they were on


Edit: how could I forget Calvin!"
"Is it me, or does the offense lock onto one WR to start the game lately?"
Lol Chase says yeah take it back to the 5 instead
Lmao Claypool...‚Äùima give that punt an extra couple yards‚Äù
Lmaoooooo claypool
Let‚Äôs go boys!  Defense and Special Teams are gonna have to step up today.  Make this a game of field position.
"Ben out front blocking?


Where are my rosary beads???"
Ben rubs his elbow every damn week
man it‚Äôs so FUCKING refreshing to see a completion in a deep ball holy fuck
Claypool plz be ok
Please be ok CC
C'mon Chase..shake it off buddy..please
F in chat for Claypool‚Äôs playtools
Ben trusts Dobbs more than his OC.
The defense has been saving their power
Sutton with the shortest redemption arc in history
we just not gonna do anything on these turnovers huh
Man I'd kill for a 2015 deangelo Williams right now
The fact that we can't run on 3rd and 2.....
Bengals fan made a post about putting the Terrible Towel in a urinal. This loss is gonna be on him.
Aaaaaaargh.  Why are they running Conner east and west?
I can not STAND stats like that TO margin stat. Of fucking course it‚Äôs better in wins than in loses. No fucking shit. They are very highly correlated. That stat means NOTHING.
"On the flip side, Berry has been punting really well"
"3 points off 2 turnovers. I know we're 8-0, but that's just really frustrating."
"Yo, offense, wake the fuck up"
Alright Randy can you pretty please challenge these 5th string corners?ü•∫
"Ben got a roughing the passer call?! BRB, going to check outside for pigs flying around"
JUJU HAVE MY BABIES
That‚Äôs vintage Ben there
When Ben plays like this we look like an 8-0 team.
It‚Äôs so annoying that the Bengals finally have a good Quarterback
"Lol Vilma just bodied that guy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a good backup, if you were good you‚Äôd be the starter‚Äù"
Ebron has been the receiving TE we thought LaDarius Green was going to be.
I don‚Äôt blame Conner I blame our run block
Minkah making a play that won't show up in the box score.
Tj fucked their field goal chance all up lol
Bengals thread is so mad right now lmao
Anyone else's game thread stuck on a bos pat?
Why does this color commentator hate the Steelers so much? Lmao He keeps bringing up how many yards they gave up on the ground to the Ravens
Man Joe Haden is the fucking man. One of our best FA signings ever
Ayyy got a yard from the run game. Better than usual!
"Tua, Herbert, Burrow.  That's a pretty good class of rookie QBs.  Gotta wonder, would you rather be playing and living in L.A., on a scrub team and living in Miami, or on a scrub team and living in Cincinnati?"
TJ can do it all
Are they seriously showing us a fucking ad when the ball might have come out?
Madness going on on the field. LETS HEAR FROM LOWES RIGHT NOW
JuJu haters are not having a good time tonight.
Yo it's 7 PM eastern and the 4th quarter hasn't started yet I hate these afternoon games
LMAO that cartoon of Ben with the super huge James Harrison arms makes me laugh when ever they show it.
Bens just practicing now
That second effort by JuJu.
Sucks to not be sure you can run for 1 yd
That‚Äôs some cool history on Spillane.
Bungles blaming the refs in their sub. Fucking hilarious.
Mason Rudolph is our human victory cigar
"Moving forward the Steelers should be throwing the ball to set up the run, not the other way around. Randy needs to stop trying to run the Bill Cowher offense. It's not going to work well with this team. We have a hall of fame QB who is still playing at a pro bowl level along with a really solid young receiving core that's been getting better every week. The offensive line seems to be a much stronger pass blocking unit as well. I hope Randy is able to figure all of this out before we get into the playoffs."
No idea why this thread got stuck. Have to go check some logs
I don‚Äôt know who the Bengals backup is but put him in and save your franchise
Solid game.  Good night all.
Damn Haden is blanketing dudes today
Just about time to go pickup Chinese food and keep this streak going.
James Conner looks lost every time we call an outside run
Maybe don't start Conner so far back on every single play
FG scaring me. Wind has definitely caught a few balls.
We need to establish the run. This wind is coming in huge gusts and ain't gonna let up. Glad we have Berry to boom kicks like that last one. I am real surprised they tried this last one with Bos and even more impressed he nailed it holy hell!
Praise be that was an elite kick in this wind
"3rd downs are either ""how much you wanna bet I can throw this over those mountains?"" or ""how many people do you think Connor can run through by himself on this screen?"""
"Is that not a safety, touched it outside the endzone"
How is it not a safety
That ball hit him! That's a safety
I'm confused how is it a touchback?
Why is that not a safety?
Hello? Isn't that a safety?
We're all happy to have Alualu back.
I love this defense so god damn much.
Jesus Christ these bengals are so undisciplined
This is the weirdest game
anyone else ever think about how nice is it to see a former divisional opponent's best player join us and then just be awesome for years? Haden is honestly one of my all time favorite Steelers over the years.
I‚Äôm tired of JC dunno about you guys
"1st and 20, we just got stuffed on the run, and Fichtner calls another run play.

Fuck's sake man."
"Come on Diontae, we know you‚Äôre better than that"
Berry is earning is job back
Alrighty TJ... its about fucking time you get a strip sack.  You are overdue on the season
Did Claypool just down the ball and try to throw it further back? üòÇ
Vance was never a major star but I've alway liked seeing him play.  Hope he's back soon.
We acting like Ben is literally made of glass
4 possessions. Good field position. 6 points. Not great.
Can‚Äôt run on Alualu
Alualu's effect on the run defense looks nice so far
Deep ball: Unlocked
THAT'S A LONG JOHNSON
James fucking Washington!!
TD!
Be ok chase
Oh chase please be ok
"Damn, what a drive. I was seriously starting to doubt our offense but they just shut me up."
My boy Clay be GOOD PLEASE
"I‚Äôm usually a fan of being aggressive, but I‚Äôm not a fan of going for 2 on that one. Take the points in all of this wind"
Hopefully claypool is fine
52 minute 1st quarter wtf!
Dammit Sutton you were gonna be the affordable resign this year
"'Bengals have kicked themselves in the foot.'

Nah they missed their foot and kicked themselves square in the dick. It's actually kind of impressive."
"I'm happy with the score, especially considering the conditions. But man Conners patient running game is not working rn"
What is up with the number of batted down passes this year?
"What on Earth is Chuks doing? You can't just let your man stand there and get up to deflect that pass, you have to engage him."
Is it just me or has Ben had way more balls tipped at the line this season?
"For being 6'5"" Ben sure has been getting a lot of passes batted down this season"
I hope to GOD that Ben will start calling the plays the rest of the game randy is ass
Glad we‚Äôre winning.  These announcers are terrible.  I hate getting the crap crews.
"Gotta love the Watt Subway commercials. ""MOM!"" ""KNOCK IT OFF!!"""
I love when someone tries to push watt he just puts their hand down for them
Why is our pass rush non-existent
"If he squares up and moves into him to initiate, how is it not OPI?"
That‚Äôs a fucking pick
"The drive we switch to zone instead of man and they pick us apart. We rush 3 instead of 4-5. Can we just stick to our strengths and what works, Butler?"
Did they change the rule about using the goalpost as a prop or was that ref just watching the bengals commit a penalty and not care?
These commentators are absolutely gagging on the Bengals dicks
It's better to be lucky then good wtf is this dude saying.
"Fucking Ben.  Wow!

Gonna really miss him when he's gone."
What a find Boswell was. He was like the 4th kicker we had the year we got him.
"That is insane confidence in the pocket, what an absolute dime from Ben"
"Seems like we score at least 1TD/game off of a long PI call forced by Claypool. Easy to forget about those yards, but they're just as good as receptions"
Bens been much better since he got dinged up
Are we gonna pressure burrow? So far he's had a completely clean pocket
Let‚Äôs get some QB pressure plzzz
I was told there would be sacks
TJ GOD DAMN WATTTTT
Ebron is fucking huge for this offense
Jonathan Vilma is in shambles that no one is establishing the run.
The James Conner special
Run the ball up the middle!!  Why do we keep running east and west like we‚Äôre playing college ball?!
I am so fucking tired of randy fichtner... Why do you not take the couple yards on second down? Wtf... Literally anyone with any football knowledge would call better plays
"Bosgod laughs at flags and eats them for breakfast. 

It's not really healthy but we can't stop him."
Lil John voice: TJ WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!!!
How does Watt end up in the full Nelson every game and no call ?
Didn't realize how big TJ was until I saw that Gatorade bottle look like a fucking baby bottle in his hands.
Alright we double the next half we win 44-14
Burrow already having a rough day out there and still a whole half left with a defense that is only just getting started.
Bingo bango bongo the Bengals gonna bungle.
"A 5 win team might make the playoffs.

O lord"
I LIFT WEIGHTS
"Aaah, the good ole try to run off the clock with 30 minutes left in the game"
Fuckkkkkkkk Randy Fichtner
Berry seems quite improved from last year
"When requesting Snell instead of Conner, please remember the fumbles"
NEW BERRY > Old Berry
"We have a stacked WR core, athletic TE, and a HoF QB, wish we would throw when up and bury bad teams instead of playing uber conservative."
Very slow game
Fuck fox and these commercials
Fucking lowes commercial during a pivotal moment
MAPLETRON
Imagine being a bengals fan and thinking you coulda won this game
"Vilma, SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP."
"Ben going for 400+ and 4 TD‚Äôs, unless they bring Rudolph in lol."
AJ GREEN IS IN THIS GAME?!
TJ Houshmanzadeh cursed this franchise against the Steelers.
"Vilma talks about him playing and being drafted in the first round every chance he gets lol. Relax bro, we know you played."
Anyone know if Vilma was drafted same class as Big Ben or not? I can‚Äôt remember?
Ben is throwing the FUK outta the ball. Calm down bb
They‚Äôve gotta get that connection going at some point. I feel like Ben always misses Claypool there
"Look , I know our run game sucks, but can we at least run a few plays to chew some time off the clock?"
Watching juju get tackled and 5 steelers by his side picking him up immediately makes me happy
Have y‚Äôall heard that Ben only went to team facilities to get his daily Covid tests??? They‚Äôve only said it about 15 times so far.
Bengals fans getting mad that the announcers are saying this is practice for Big Ben cause their team can't show the fuck up.
where are snell and mcfarland at?  Running game aint shit give em a shot
This is the best game Jordan Berry has had in a long time.
"kinda feel bad for AJ Green man, it‚Äôs sad to see a legend decline despite being such a huge rival"
MCCLOUD
"All I've heard this year is how amazing Burrow is, looks pretty ass today."
This is exactly what my heart needed this week
Ray Ray is gonna return a kick before this season is over
Burrow looks like he pizza'd when he should have french fried.
Is it just me or has Berry been killing it since his re-signing?
Rudolph time
"Games over,  now time to go watch SpaceX take off.  T minus 7 minutes.  In case you guys didn't know"
We should save Burrows from Cincy and have him as our backup lol
claypool is so fucking good. made up for his missed catches today
Vilma is not hip
Only the Bengals would put their fake punt on film during garbage time
Ladies and gentlemen: It's Rudolph time
Been a strange game. I haven‚Äôt been able to feel my heartbeat in my eyeballs even once!
What a catch by Hopkins...
Holy fuck Arizona
"So the Packers/ Saints/ Ravens/ Chiefs.

The only other 4 teams with 2 losses or less"
Wtf is going on with the broadcast right now. They had the camera on Tomlin for 2 minutes while they were talking about nothing.
I have to be honest..l Drank just a little too much and dozed off for a few minutes....is Ben OK? I kind of think that they put Rudolph in because the game is out of reach...but just want to make sure.
Ben looking like a snack in that graphic
"Burrow back out,,,,not smart"
Ok boys. Signing off. As usual enjoyed the hell out of bantering with yinz.  9-0.
They really should pull Burrow. We have been getting pressure with second stringers in there. There‚Äôs no need to keep him in there and risk the future of the franchise
"I know the game is a forgone conclusion, but watching back up D players come out and keep feasting is awesome to watch."
Bruh... kyler Murray‚Äôs bomb to Hopkins was insane...
You know you‚Äôre a Steelers fan when a 29-7 lead still isn‚Äôt enough to unclinch your cheeks
STOP RUNNING A FUCKING OUTSIDE RUN RANDY. ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING
I don‚Äôt know/care if it is Conner or the O-line responsible for the terrible run game. What I do know is that he cannot get any yards running outside. Put Derek in and go up the middle.
Can we stop using that stretch play please thanks
I really hate Vilma. He‚Äôs been so fuckin biased so far
there we go...no 1st possession 3 and out
Why does he keep saying three and out? The Steelers picked up a first down.
BOZGAWD
What a garbage camera work
"Ben didn‚Äôt practice all week, didn‚Äôt expect a fast start"
The wind is no match for Bosgod
If you've lost the endzone you can look and you will find him. Bosgod will be there.
How do we not get points from that????
That was a safety wtf? He touched it.
"Who welcomes Burrow to the AFC North first?

My money is on Watt."
"Man, I forgot AJ Green was even still in the league."
They need to tie a string on that Ref. He's going to blow away
Lol wow Bungles looking super prepared out there
I‚Äôm already very thankful our games are rarely on Fox.
Does Conner have eyes? Y
Great hands Diontae.
This offense is really frustrating
Claypool making the big plays moving that ball back two yards
The offense will awaken sooner or later just wait
The run blocking has been abysmal for most of the season but some of the blame has to go on Conner and the playcalling as well. Conner doing way too much dancing and the insistence on running these zone runs to the outside when Conner doesn't have the speed to beat people to the edge is simply baffling.
Haden balling out so far today
BIG BEN BLOCKING QB
Ben was like imma block imma block fuck that
LMAO Ben leading the blockers. That was hilarious.
Bungals fans will say that was a dirty play by Connor
Damn tumble weeds going across the field
Conner doesn‚Äôt even try to avoid tacklers lol he just puts his whole body down and goes down
I really don't want to see Rudolph in unless he's taking a knee at the end of the game with the lead.
I had surgery on my foot and have screws in it. If it get stepped on im in crippling pain for a few minutes. I would expect any surgical area to be sensitve forever
Playing the Steelers twice will drop that yardage
I‚Äôll allow those underneath passes all day
"Defense doing their job, wake up offense"
Imagine being a Bengals fan.
This game is gonna last til 8 if we keep this pace up lol
This drive is exactly why you don‚Äôt give up on DJ  after an early drop.
"Damn, I thought Johnson was killing us guys?"
"Get well Claypool, we need you"
Oh no no no no
Please don't tell me Claypool is injured...
"He‚Äôs just winded I reckon, give him a minute should be fine I hopeee"
I wonder if he smashed his nuts he was getting up like he got sacked.
I just want a burger and fries Domino's...
I get being up 14... but its the fucking first quarter... just kick the ball.   Unless it was suddenly gusting bad enough that even the extra point was sketchy.
Bengals really look like they‚Äôre half assing it
Still waiting on that first sack to keep the streak going
The defense reacted immediately to the audible lol.
FUMMMBLLLLLLLLLE!
Ripped that shit out like a Beyblade
How many times are we going to run that stretch play and lose 5 yards?
"Cam sutton is a strip sack artist, how many is that now, geez"
I hate Randy‚Äôs calling SO MUCH. You can tell when the dude some kind of sweep or some shit
I‚Äôm tired of Fichtner‚Äôs dumbass run it on first and 10 and get stuffed scheme
It‚Äôs only the end of the first? GTA VI is gonna release before this game ends
"Bengals ""kicked themselves in the foot""

-Jonathan Vilma

lol"
"If Connor is gunna run, it can‚Äôt be to the outside."
LoL...911.  only disaster they haven't had yet is an alien invasion
I live for silently watching the Bengals game thread comment meltdown. It‚Äôs one of my favorite Bengals vs Steelers traditions as of recent
"""Jersey Shore Family Vacation"" sounds like the absolute worst possible thing to ever go on television"
"2020, the year of the knock downs for Ben."
"0-5 on third downs. 

Alright, defense, you're up"
Every time Washington gets the ball I'm all smiles.
"""More turnovers than first downs...""

Gotta love that!"
"&#x200B;

That was less than optimal"
How on earth and Higgins be that wide open?
How is a TB Tampa team gonna get crushed 38-3 by NO at home but a depleted SF team stays ahead of NO in the Superdome?
Jonathan Vilma can eat a whole bag of dicks.
Haden playing A game coverage today
Better move the ball on offense here no stupid run plays
"Hey defense, you should get a sack

Haha jk

Unless....üëÄ"
Just a reminder that Vilma was drafted 1 pick after Ben
Claypool is a PI generating machine and I love it
Our receivers are really letting Ben down today
How the fuck did that ball get to JuJu?
When the steelers score I say yes
JuJu all day baby!!
Large Benjamin
I can‚Äôt stand Vilma announcing this. You‚Äôd think we were losing and 0-8 according to him
that's a big Juju in the stands there
Sack this fool
Stop. Playing. Base. Defense. Against. 11. Personnel.
Burrow has like 2 good throws and you guys start freaking out. We are ok guys promise. Nice sack by TJ by the way.
Ben should never have to practice again
need at least 20 point lead at the half to feel comfortable.
Just imagine if we were catching all of these passes hitting players hands. We would be unstoppable.
Everything is great except those stupid outside runs
JC running laterally is gonna give me liver failure
Connor ain't great but these calls are leaving him in a terrible situation
"You're welcome, everyone. I traded diontae johnson in fantasy this week and by law every move I ever make is the wrong one. I'm ok with this."
Run game fucked our whole drive.
Whole drive ruined because of Randy‚Äôs dumb fucking shotgun outside run. Thanks a lot you stupid fuck.
Conner averaging five yards per carry today.  Wait a minute.... what do you mean sideways yards don‚Äôt count?
Alright need out ‚Äú#1‚Äù defense to step up here
Holding on tj
"TJ Watt getting held every play, as usual"
Beautiful shot of TJ in a choke hold
Totally not holding TJ right there. Nope wasn't hanging on him at all. It was just defensive hugging. ~the refs probably.
"This game is great so far, but this season especially we seem to be Jekyll and Hyde with our halves.  Hope we retain our dominance and finish them."
How great would TJ WATT be if they started calling all the holding penalties against him.
Lol just a play to get Burrows numbers up
"Don't ever disrespect this d, they come to play every time it's important."
"Pretty good first half all in all, still room for improvement though. It would be nice to get the run game figured out so we can grind them down in the 2nd half."
I wanna win Terrys money :(
Should we run up the score because fuck the Bengals.
So weird looking at the stands and seeing them so empty. Goes for any team. Fuck this virus so hard.
Haden is having himself a ballgame.
Haden has been killin it today
God damn I love Joe Haden
"Have a GAME, Haden!"
What Steeler/former Steeler hurt Jonathan Vilma so bad?
Imagine if we started calling simple runs instead of these slow developing outside zones
"We should run 2 straight plays, that's sure to fool em!"
"Is it me or is Johnathan Vilma the biggest tool? Everything is all about him and he sounds so cocky when he talks. Man, I would hate to hang out with that guy..."
Who‚Äôs ready to be super conservative and blow this game like we almost did against Philly and Tennessee?
"Run, run, pass. That‚Äôll fool em!"
I've talked a lot of shit about berry but he's been money these last two weeks
Did Berry get laid?!? Great punt!
I'm sure glad the ad is way more important than a possible turnover in the game.
"might be a turnover

COMMERCIAL"
"There‚Äôs not enough commercials during an NFL game, gotta throw some in during it."
Power running with Conner. Who would have thought?
"Ben thinks all the WRs are 7'2"""
# Touchdown Chase Claypool!!!!
Claypool is a god damn monster...
Claypool is the greatest WR in NFL history.
"One of these days, I will learn what blue 80 means."
Now time for another TJ Sack... get him leading the NFL
WE NEED TO KEEP THIS CORP FOR YEARS IDFC
That pump fake is overpowered lol
Claypoooool. My man. Once he starts consistently catching these balls in traffic. Watch out
"Ugh they've got us right where they want us, up 22 with 4 min left in the third.  We're playing right into their hand."
"The Big Ben being a ‚Äúweakness‚Äù narrative dying in a fire today, and rightfully so. The dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen."
Now bens just gotta get Washington a TD
Bengals fans wishing for injuries on Ben smh
defense played shitty last week to honeypot burrow into thinking he was gonna eat this week wow tomlin really playing 4D chess
The Bengals Twitter post shitting on the terrible towel is clearly showing...teams still don‚Äôt learn the curse it carries. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This commentary‚Äôs career highlight was being drafted in the same year as Ben
No heart attacks so far. I like that
Did y'all know vilma was in the same draft class as big ben?
Washington is probably a wr2 on a lot of teams. We have the best 4 wr sets in the NFL
Fitzpatrick so close on that pick!!
"Hey, guys... I‚Äôm just posting to let you all know that Vilma was drafted in the same class as Ben. That‚Äôs a fun fact that you probably haven‚Äôt heard today."
Is it just me or is this game D R A G G I N G
"'What are they talking trash about?'

Been asking myself that about the Bengals' fans all week."
It‚Äôs 7 o‚Äôclock and there‚Äôs still another fucking quarter to go
Games like this make me remember how much I wish Ben could run
"‚ÄúFuck drafting a receiver in the 1st round.‚Äù

-The Pittsburgh Steelers organization"
Surely Ben will connect with Claypool on one of those sideline passes eventually
Holy shit stop talking about the Saints
Is that coach Randy with the mask up to his eyebrows lol?
Juju is hard to tackle
[deleted]
Jordan Berry is a fucking punter today
"Holy shit, when did Berry become good??"
If only a 1 yard run was something we could manage
my god that's huge lol
Berry on the Boswell redemption arc.
RAY! RAY!
Almost reindeer time boys!
COME ON RAY RAY
McCloud is the PR we‚Äôve been waiting a decade for.
Jeez man Ray Ray is long overdue for a TD
god i hope we can give Juju the money he wants
"If Ray Ray isn‚Äôt an all-pro this year, we riot."
Can we pull starters at this point? I don‚Äôt want people to get hurt
Who dey? The guys getting their asses kicked.
The bengals really thought they could win lmao
4 TD lead. Time to call off the dogs and see what Mason Rudolph has. We‚Äôll see if Benny Snell football can close too
We‚Äôve put up 36 points and we can‚Äôt run the ball worth a damn. This is some Kansas City shit lol.
Juju made some fucking plays today. Nothing super flashy in the stats but he made several first downs and a TD of course.
"Ray Ray Facts.  He was a star Running back in high school. 

He can throw the ball 60 yards in case we ever want to use him for a trick play."
Something‚Äôs not right.. there‚Äôs 10 minutes left in the 4th and I‚Äôm not sat up straight and shaking like a mentalist.
"""Footballs only fun when you win"" 

Ain't that the truth buddy, having the time of my life this year."
Ben is done.  At least the Rudolph flashback to 2019 will not be as painful watching him be a starter.  As a backup... I'm fine wit dat.
What we learned today is that the ravens will always be a tough game. But we‚Äôll always put the browns and bengals in their place
Prediction: Mason will throw a 55 yard touchdown to claypool
SPILLAINED!!
Why r y‚Äôall so butt hurt over the announcers every week. Goddamn. They get excited when football plays happen... relax
They should of took Burrow out the game was over now he is more hurt good job guys.
Welcome to the AFC North Joe
Soooo they punt faked to get their QB to injure his ankle more ??? Uh ok
FYI TJ houzyourmama tweeted the terrible towel shoe shine today. When will they learn
[deleted]
Man if we can just get this offense going. This defense is SO fucking good
[deleted]
Maybe offense will wake the hell up now. Should have at least 20 points by now
"Steelers: score

Fox: here‚Äôs how burrow is best."
Ben looked great today no lie
"The ""Fire Tomlin"" crowd sure is quiet this year."
"What is this weird feeling? No chest pain, tachycardia, anger? This is weird. Good job boys. WHO DEY!?"
"Fans of other teams dream about winning seasons and playoff appearances. 

I just want an offensive unit that doesn't start slow 15 games out of 16."
Whelp. Turnover wasted because Fichtner‚Äôs stupid calls put us in 2nd and 16.
Break out the nitroglycerin.
We need to establish a good run game and not resort to 5-wide on every play.  Hopefully having Watt back will help.
"Good Morning. I have to work at our off site storage today. My company doesn‚Äôt allow people to work by themselves so I need to support my colleague while she is on the forklift. 

I will be watching the game cold sober, by myself, in a weird warehouse office, next to a mulch factory."
Carson Wentz is fucking trash
Imagine being a fan of any other team. Here we go.
Lfmaooo Conner is so slow üò≠
Cmon Conner. Just run straight and don‚Äôt hesitate
Conner just run the fucking ball stop tip toeing
Unable to convert hopefully the wind won‚Äôt mess with the fg
Gotta crank the motor on offense
WIZARD OF BOZ
"It‚Äôs ok guys, once we start losing backyard Ben will start playcalling"
Why was that a touchback and not a safety
Shouldn't that be a safety?
That was def a safety
Why is that not a saftey
Ball fielded outside the endzone fumbled back into the end zone recovered and tackled. What's going on here?
Why wasn't that a safety?
come on lets murder this rookie.
praise the legend joseph haden
"i want to see big play ray ray take it all the way!  EDIT: at some point, apparently im a few seconds behind lol"
Our running is piss poor
Running on 1st and 20 makes me want to punch a wall
Run blocking is not a strength of this offensive line
Yikes Conner
Conner does not have outside speed
"Quite honestly I think Dotson has been playing better than DeCastro this year, specifically on run blocking."
Damn DJ just catch the ball
This game could end 3-0
Maybe next possession the offense will wake up.
Steelers and slow starts. Name a better duo
Settle down boys. This wind is atrocious. The ball is gonna be going all over. It‚Äôs hard to catch when the ball is moving around.
Yeah that was very obvious claypool üòÇ
Man I wish we signed bell for that minimum deal like KC did
Ben‚Äôs ‚Äúblocking attempt‚Äù lol
Decastro and Okorafor just parted the Red Sea
"Lol give Ben a break guys, he‚Äôs on two bad knees"
Now THIS is NFL level playcalling
No injuries :/
Why take a commercial break when he is literally jogging off the field?
Ben to Enron 0-4
"Swear to god, they fucking know that us fans will always get stressed the fuck out over seeing the slightest bump to bens elbow."
"Thanks for putting that voodoo on Boswell, ya bastard."
‚ÄúMason Rudolph has played football before‚Äù
Why do we keep wasting 3rd and 5 by overthrowing deep?
Announcers really trying to jinx Boz. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs never missed a kick against Cincinnati‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs made 22 straight field goals‚Äù
"""Joe Burrow wants to move the ball, and wants to win games""

Wow"
I don‚Äôt want to know about Joe‚Äôs open relationship.
Perfect throw by Ben
#TOUCHDOWN!
LETS GOOOOO
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BEN CALLS THE PLAYS
Come on Chase. Be ok.
"That was a good catch by Johnson, focus had to be on 100 to make that. Ball was right there"
He got the wind knocked out of him. Hopefully.
The ground made a needed adjustment on his elbow
Chase no!!! Please be okay!
That was some drive! If Ben can connect that deep ball this offense can do so much more.
"Dionte, Chase, and JuJu are just incredible to watch."
I think he took the pylon to the jewels
Think he got the wind knocked out
"The wind has pissed Ben off and now he‚Äôs going off. 
Great fucking drive boys."
This game won't be over until midnight
Lol that looked like me in Madden
">Injury Report: No. 21 Mackensie Alexander has been taken into the locker room to be evaluated for a possible concussion. His return is questionable

looks like they will be playing with 2 CBs the rest of the game"
Ball!  Ball!
"Pitt had Aaron Donald, JC, and Boyd (they both played big time as freshman) in 2013 and won only 7 games.

That program is cursed."
"""Kicked themselves in the foot."""
"I will give the Bungles a bit of credit here...they are doing pretty well against the pass rush. Burrow, I don‚Äôt think,has been hit once...yet..."
"Connors vison is his biggest downfall, he just can't seem to find that hole"
Missing Vance hardcore rn üò≠
4 WR set on 3rd and 2.  I guess our own coaches don't trust our run game.... it's that bad.
That‚Äôs like 15 knockdowns this season for Ben.
WIDEEEEEEEEEEEE OPEN
Well that wasn't really fucking cool of our secondary...
Why tf is TJ playing in coverage
THATS A PICK PLAY
Well....fuck....
I hate knowing exactly what's coming and watching the defense get roasted by it. We always get owned by these rub routes
How is that not a pick?
Also the non play by play announcer is annoying af
Burrows > Mayfield
Pass rush gotta get home.
"Watching on delay: these announcers are trash. Can anyone explain why the muffed kickoff was NOT a safety? Hit him in the field of play, then recoct in the endzone and forced out of bounds.... Announcers didn't even bring it up"
Fox sports. Please stop showing me this picture of what Ben Roethlisberger would look like in the Take On Me music video. I hate it.
Announcers always give randy props. I really think his play calling is terrible.
"Juju, you have redeemed yourself"
Way to make up for it Juju
#JUJU!
"""There we go"" totally unbiased commentators"
Claypool. Good to see he‚Äôs ok.  That‚Äôs our first 3rd down conversion.
"I like Colin Cowherd (I know, sue me), but I giggle to myself whenever he points out ""Ya know, I think Ben is the weak spot on the Steelers roster!"" He's done it like three times over the past month."
This taco bell commercial is messed up because taco bell has literally annihilated everything good from their menu
"Throw it to Mama bear, JuJu!

You love to see that."
"Being in England, this game is gonna fuck my sleep up"
Burrow is gonna be a damn good QB
The sack streak is alive and cooking
"watt hasn't done the high kick in a minute, he must be excited about that one."
I do believe that it‚Äôs Dionte Johnson‚Äôs week. You just can‚Äôt cover them all...good problem to have.
James Conner looks really bad today. Running to the side and backwards.
"Conner struggling today


Keep those legs churning young money


He'll break free"
"PUT WATT IN AND RUN IT DOWN THEIR THROAT GODDAMMIT


Stretch is not working, bring Derek Watt in and go up the middle"
Dionte hit them with that Okie Doke.
james Conner going laterally makes me want to gouge my eyes out
"It‚Äôs not even on Conner it‚Äôs these shitty outside run playcalls with a back who isn‚Äôt fast. Not to mention that side of the line got blown back before he could get around the edge. Get under the ball, put watt in a run that shit NORTH!!!! Stop with the East/west calls"
I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Connor‚Äôs fault. The o-line is not helping him at all
All I want for Christmasssssss is a new OC
Retire outside zone and sweep and don‚Äôt let it appear until next season.
Instant flag thrown... 'no flag on the play'... the fuck did they think was wrong?
Why is Boswell such a chad
Tj watt literally getting fucking choked..
Ahh yes let's zoom in on the headlock Watt had been in all season
TJ WATT IS MY DAD
TJ WATTTT!
TJ I'm happy you got the sack but maybe don't dance when they're about to spike it and catch you off sides. Too close
"I hope Watt whispered in his ear 'the rest of your career baby, you and me' when they were on the ground together."
"Lol Mondeaux has a VIBE. That hair and that little mustache, with the pretty flower sleeve üå∏"
"Mondo ate that double, well done to allow tj up the middle"
game breaking play there if they can hold them off here
Please don‚Äôt let them get points
Credit to Mondeaux on that play
Bungals rolling over and showing their belly early. I was expecting a closer game.
Big stop by the defense
"Strong half. 

Defense stellar outside of a busted play, offense woke up. Looking like a great overall team right now"
"Wow.

A first half without any cardiac problems.  We should do this more often!"
"Game ball for Haden, unless disaster strikes."
Haden looks like he can play at this level another 3-5 years
HADEN CAME TO PLAY TODAY. THANK YOU REFS FOR LETTING THEM PLAY.
That's such great coverage by Haden.
Joe Haden is in rare form tonight
"I knew when Devin Bush got hurt our run D would feel it. It took time, but you can see it now."
Haden looks 4 years younger on the field today
Conner needs to be put in timeout for a few plays
Conner's definitely getting cut next year.
Wow. Our running game is SO BAD
Steelers have no running game. None zilch
"The good ole ‚Äúrun, run, pass, punt‚Äù"
The classic Run Run Pass
A fairy dies every time the Steelers run on 2nd and 10
looks like giving Berry a few weeks vacation lit the fire under his ass lmaoooo let‚Äôs go man
Incase you missed it James Conner had 2 ineffective runs stalling our drive again
No way that's actually Berry.
LOL come on dude you gotta call fair catch on that when the hounds have been released
Can someone tell me how the hell we can run the ball against good D-lines like the Giants and Eagles but suck against the 31st and 32nd ranked run defenses in the league?
Would really like Williamson get some run today. Not sure why he hasn't seen more action to this point.
Wait. Runs can go for MORE than 1 yard? Pretty sure thats illegal
Do the Steelers still do play action on offense?
"Watt will never get a call, might as well just hold the fuck out of him"
How the fuck does this broadcast team not show one angle of the play before commercial
ehhh he kicked up grass lol he's in
Fumble. Let‚Äôs hear from Lowesw
That ten yard opposite hash mark out route throw  is exactly why Ben is a franchise QB
That 11 yard run felt like a 30 yarder. lol
Ben is just playing Madden.
nearly doubled our run yardage with an 11 yard play lol
No QB has a better pump fake than our very own Ben Roethlisberger
Ben broke that dudes ankles with the pump
Ben‚Äôs gonna be like ‚Äúcan I just stay at home every week?‚Äù
"he literally pumped their linebacker to the ground lmao his pump fakes are always so good, and it was to see some more of it this drive. I love when he gets the camera man, too"
I hope we hang 40+ on them
We running up the score i guess
"STOP THE COUNT!
-bengals fan probably"
I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre still in the third quarter
just peeked in the Bungles sub and their fans are seriously blaming this embarrassment on the refs. Is there a dumber fan base in the NFL?
Is that the 4th or 5th time they had to coddle Vilma and his draft class next to Ben?
"AJ Green, did not know he was playing"
Can we get Benny Snell in. Rest up James
"Bungle fans hoping Ben gets his knee wrecked. What a sad and pathetic team, city, and fan base"
our receivers keep getting separation but he just can't hit em. breaks my heart
See flair
"""If I lick my fingies maybe I do better.""

- J. Burrow"
Should we pick up Ohio States quarterback this year
How does tj watt never get these holding calls bro. I‚Äôm so tired of watching him get mugged
"If we score, even if its just a FG, I'd say take Ben out"
Bad adjustment there Chase.. that is one you should have had
"Randy... that play was read so fucking hard... stop trying to outsmart people, YOU ARE NOT SMARTER THAN OTHERS"
Berry has been great since coming back.
**Ray Ray** **McCloud**.   He‚Äôs GOOD.
"Juju is really doing a great job of channeling Ward.  Get ball, move forward at all cost.  When not a target, what blocking or contribution can I do to help someone else."
"We fucking hate the Browns and the Bengals, don't we? The only games that we trully dominate"
I didn‚Äôt start Chase Claypool in fantasy. AMA.
Can we pls sit Ben now?
"There we go, now Mason can go in. Pull as many receivers as possible too. Don't need to be creating any new ABs today."
ok i think its time to sit ben. for safety
I hope the coaching staff realizes that we are a pass first team by now. Any success we've had on the ground recently has been set up by gashing opponents in the passing game
Someone please send me the video of Juju and Ebron dancing
I want Mason to throw 2 touch downs just because.
Nice tackle Ray Ray at least
Well... guess we had that coming.  Bengals can practice things too
Cinci looking to get that touchdown that's worth 30 points.
Bungals. Stop trying. Youre down 29. Just take it.
Why waste a fake play when you've already lost
This Jonathan guy has a large boner for the Bengals.
Oh my god bengals you're just going to get your new franchise QB murdered
Alright put Rudolph in the game lol. Don‚Äôt need Ben taking unnecessary shots
Why do we have TJ in there? For stat padding?
"Yo im happy we are winning, but seeing Burrow hurt sucks"
Bengals are fucking up their qb the same way the colts did.
Bengals still the Bengals.
Who Dey?
"Holy shit, D Hop"
That cards game though
He got off the field fine. So hopefully dude is okay. You hate to see someone get rolled on like that. Always scares me.
"time for benny snell football

here we go baby"
Can Mason throw 18 yards?
This Snell guy is pretty good...
Washington Football Team‚Äôs Super Bowl is on 12/6.
Why not let Rudy try to make something happen? The guy needs some confidence and this is the game to get him some.
First game in a long time that I haven't had incredible stress or crushing chest pains. Gg. Especially Haden. Hope he stays on fire.
Lol everyone‚Äôs blaming the defense like they didn‚Äôt force 3 straight 3 and outs and a turnover. This is on the offense.
"The Bengals subreddit worrying about dirty hits from us, as if they aren‚Äôt fans of the team that continued to employ Vontaze Burfict, the dirtiest NFL player of our time, after he single-handedly lost them the wild card game that was their 7th consecutive playoff loss.

Mind blown."
Still think that was a saftey
"Any rules experts know why that wasn't a safety? NFL.com says it is a safety:  

>when an impetus by a team sends the ball behind its own goal line, and the ball is dead in the end zone in its possession or the ball is out of bounds behind the goal line."
Derek watt is back in now. It‚Äôs no excuse for these damn shotgun runs now. Give Conner a FB to run behind
Haden looking good so far
Let‚Äôs give it to Conner so he can try to find bengal defenders and run into them.
"Juju still real good.


Still want juju.


But also: dam, diante making some big plays this season"
üÖ±Ô∏èUüÖ±Ô∏èU üÖ±Ô∏èmith-üÖ±Ô∏èchuster
3rd and 15.  Better throw a 2 yard pass.
Idk about you guys but I‚Äôm terrified of the 1-8 Jags next week
Hopefully Burrow is okay
Piss poor run play ruined the drive.
"lol @ bengals sub all crying and calling Ben the r word, I just couldn‚Äôt imagine talking that much shit if my team hadn‚Äôt won a playoff game in 30 years"
Let‚Äôs go joe Haden
So glad we picked up Haden.
Classic pick play. Never penalized.
"Can't touch the crossbar on a td celebration, where's the penalty refs?"
JuJu is WR1
Weathers going to be nuts for this game. I‚Äôm hype.
Are they going to make us watch the end of this windy nightmare in Cleveland or is the game going to be aired on time?
I know we joke about heart attacks but my sister is an avid runner. During the baltimore game her apple watch said her heart rate hit 200 bpm lol
"Couple passes to start the game, just like the opposite of what everybody guaranteed would happen."
Love me some Johnson early in the game.
"That damn wind, he had him beat too"
What‚Äôre the stats of attempts/ completions of ben‚Äôs deep ball this season?
Wind carried it.
Ben hasn‚Äôt completed a long pass like that all season. Stop doing them on 3rd down ffs
Benny Snell Football
LETS GOOOO ULTIMATE FOURTH DOWN PLAY
That punt counts as a long pass. This is still the same drive.
LOL no need to make first downs if you can force a turnover on a punt
Run Run Pass?
"Fuck it, go for it"
"Could've zoomed the camera out on the FG there, Fox."
Obligatory Boswell fucks comment
Zoom more please
Does anyone know how windy it is?
"Great kick, especially considering the wind."
Welp already annoyed with Fichtner again
People worrying about the offense now probably shouldn‚Äôt. Game today will probably be mostly defensive with the wind and we are much better equipped to pivot to the run.
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
*ball rolls away sadly*
My man was so confused
Lmao wtf just happened
They are losing their minds in the Bengals sub game thread about special teams and it is a lot of fun to watch lol
Can someone explain how that isnt a safety.
Bungles gonna bungle
Why was that not a safety? Is that a rule I‚Äôm not aware of?
How is that not a safety?
You can tell it‚Äôs windy because of the way it is
How are they not even gonna show a replay of that?
"They should give the head refs Daft Punk helmets on windy days like this, so they can call penalties"
That‚Äôs the kind of defense we need to keep running passing downs. Press man and let our D line eat
"Now here's a team who can't play football, Jim"
"I'm not trying to hate on Randy but man it'd be nice to have an OC that can call some explosive plays, instead of nickel and diming our way to a 4th down"
"Bengals are 29th ranked run defense, come on Steelers let‚Äôs get it going"
It‚Äôll be nice to have a real running game again someday
Our offense is seriously buns
Offense has started like 2 games well this year.
What the hell kinda run was that?
DJ just broke his own ankles and got in the fetal position ‚ò†
This run game needs some serious help man
Catch that Johnson. The Steelers needed that and so did my fantasy team
"Offense struggling early, defense doing their job, no surprises.  Have my beer in one hand and my blood pressure tester standing by.  Go Steeler football!"
"If Diontae didn‚Äôt have stone hands, dude would be one of the best receivers in football...Well too bad because he does have stone hands."
"Ben we need you at QB, you cannot be lead blocker too."
That snap was yikes
"Run down the clock offense, let the defense rest up some so they aren‚Äôt gassed"
"Just keep going North South with Connor... legit, its working... he has never been great at designed east west runs... Use Edmonds for those, or Claypool on that jet sweep design."
I wonder how much of the elbow rubbing is soreness or Ben just worried about it.
"Bro just get the damn first down, Jesus"
Every week its something
[deleted]
"I think the announcer just jinxed Boswell for later in the game, fuck."
Putting Rudolph in would be a sure-fire way to lose this game
Gonna hit the Bengals with that classic 2017 Chiefs field goal only defeat.
Do we just not use the middle of the field?
I just don‚Äôt get this playcall at all. it‚Äôs not fluid or dangerous AT ALL.
Are the Bengals even trying?
What about that deep ball
is that the first deep pass that ben has made this year lmao
WE CONNECTED ON A DEEP BALL GUYS
Who said Ben's deep ball was gone? Who said it?
Strong pass on the wind with DJ
LETS GOO DEONTAE
But. But. But muh elbow
What a drive üî•üî•üî•
DJ caught a pass AND Ben completed a deep ball
Fuck the wind apparently
LETS GOOOO
Kick the XP
Chase my baby boy! Nooo
"I'm getting sick by the way of them making a big deal every single time Ben touches his elbow. It happens every game where they point something about, and it's always nothing."
"I am enjoying this game

edit: well shit as soon as I say Chase is shaken up

FUCK"
Did he catch the pylon to the nads?
how the turn tables with DJ
Remember 6 minutes ago when bens elbow was done? Lmao
I hope Claypool is okay
YESSSSS
Cam Sutton a fucking animal
Let‚Äôs go Sutton way to bounce back.
Ugh. Can we put a FB and just run forward??
Sutton is based
I love strippers!
"Did Vilma just say ""kicked themselves in the foot""??..how exactly do you do that??"
lol they kicked themselves in the foot
I was talking shit on Sutton for what seemed like a weird tackle but he shut me the FUCK up quick
"Bro, they have to put Watt in at fullback, wtf did you bring in him for if you‚Äôre not going to use him.¬†"
how about give snell a chance at a zone run for once instead of running out Conner to do the same shit over and over or send either of them on hb dives right into the line lol
I don't sweat when the play breaks down I get EXCITED
Imagine if this team had a run game
12 points with 6 drives with great field position. We should be up at least 3 possessions. Without those turnovers we're probably sitting on 0 points.
No points off turnover there. Brutal.
We still need a sack
Thank god for Minkahs speed.
I have no idea why we're content to sit back and rush 4. Their OL is terrible and their QB is young. Force him to speed up his process.
At least Fitzpatrick was able to catch him
How do you get hit by those 3 guys and not spontaneously explode
"alright ben, get us some points"
What happened to the pass rush?
NEVER BE FLAT
Textbook pick but okay
Literally no point of taking the ball out of the end zone. You‚Äôll hardly ever reach the 25
"Vilma: ‚Äúhe‚Äôs big and tall so his ball‚Äôs don‚Äôt get batted down‚Äù

Are you commentating the same game we‚Äôre watching?"
JuJu's first drop of the year
Stop stopping my heart Steelers!
There ya go Juju
GOOD SHIT JUJU
JUJU GREAT CATCH
JuJu showing up big time.
JuJU standing there waving his hands WIDE OPEN
Vilma is literally cheering after bengals defensive stops can we replace this guy with a can of soup or something
Did Claypool call him a bitch?? Lmao
Hell of a throw by Big Ben let‚Äôs go!!!!
Great drive Ben
Ebron mean mugging the fuck out of him in that replay.
TD JUJU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
JUJUUUUUUUUU
Always Juju. Always.
Great fucking throw
YES JUJU!!!!!
Wow Ben looked sacked great play
fuckin classic ben dive into the jaws of the beast to take it down lmao
Outstanding from Ben
Vilma hating more than this thread in the first quarter
That juju celebration was so wholesome. I love that guy.
Ima need to see a sack here soon.
Pretty sure that was jujus family
Time for a sack
i feel like there‚Äôs gonna be a fight at some point during this game
Finally a sack!
If our sack streak ends against the fucking Bungles I‚Äôll be very sad LOL.
Did we forget they call us blitzburg? Light this dude up.
TeeeeeeeJayyyyyyy
"TJ Watt is gonna get your ass. It's inevitable, just accept it"
Watt weclomes Burrow to the AFC North properly.
TJ WATT!!!!!
Lol this color guy saying the top teams I. The afc north run first. Has he seen a single one of our games?
Bearded Ben is my favorite Ben.
"That stat was like:


Wayne gretzky and his brother have more NHL points than any other family"
Did you guys know this is our best start in franchise history?
Big Ben making sure all the rookies in the AFC North can answer who their daddy is and what does he do.
Lmfaooo Ben is torching these guys.
I really like Diontae Johnson
god we can‚Äôt run the ball
JC needs the day off lol
Connor is really not having a great game
If I were to try to tackle Dionte I would have two compound fractures at my ankles.
"These runs just don‚Äôt work. Flush that part of the playbook down the toilet, please."
Who the fuck is calling these run plays ??? My god ...
Connor needs to start cutting those up inside
Just abandon the run. This secondary is doodoo.
Don't run the ball ever again lol
Lets just keep going 5-wide all game and keep Ben SLINGIN
ENOUGH WITH THESE SHOTGUN RUNS. FOR FUCKS SAKE
I can't believe Diontae hasn't broken 100 yards befire
Once again... stop calling east west designs for Connor... that is not his strength.  He is a north south workhorse and that field is fucking slick from rain today.
"Alright, who put that stick of butter on the field? Not cool"
"Man, this run game is legitimately embarrassing. Not even trying anything new either, just the same stretch zone runs that lose 4-5 yards almost like clockwork."
Leveon in his prime was something else conners not even close
Conner going to have 100 yard game...Sideways
Why do we keep running outside for a loss.
"Anyone else just see Ben say ""I knew that was gonna happen"" after that run play lol"
Connor is not an outside runner please stop scheming him like this Randy ffs
Bengals defense is hot garbage.
Looking forward to more McFarland when he gets healthy.
we just hate first downs don‚Äôt we
"We need to find a solution to the running game, Connor running to the outside is just not cutting it. Run up the middle or try giving someone else the ball"
BOSGOD üôè
Berry showing some pro bowl talent with those FG holds.
Those suspenders are the real MVP
"The return of BosGod, 5th most accurate FG kicker of all time"
Villanueva is a massive human being.
yep.....play that prevent and let this plug pad his stats
"Nfl rule book: in order to call holding on TJ Watt, he must be held 13 times before a flag can be thrown."
TJ just took them out of field goal range
Arm around the neck holding the collar isn't a hold?
"""hold deez nuts"" -TJ Watt"
I love how the replay shows a hold on TJ
TJ WATT DPOY
TJ just MAULED that rookie.
HOT DAMN... gorgeous stunt play there TJ
The Dline woke up
Great half of football boys.
Fuck the bungles :)
Has Avery played at all?
God that NFL clothing in the commerical looks cheesy
Haden is having a great game
Haden having a monster game
Did Vilma just say Ben's top receiver today was Antonio Brown?
Plz put snell in
Imagine if we go up 30-7 here üçÜüí¶
Run is just not working it seems
Our ‚Äúrun game‚Äù is making me depressed
"Ben's been killing it, throw the damn ball."
3 and out
fuckin randy man lmao
I can‚Äôt watch James Conner run the ball any longer for FUCKS SAKE
Back to back weeks against bottom feeder DL‚Äôs. Nothing. Sigh
C'mon get back to being aggressive... Letting off the gas is how we get burned
cant advance far in the playoffs if you are one dimensional even against the worst of run defenses
It's like we just waste every other drive with shit playcalling
"Ok, I've been shitting on you for years, but that was a great punt Berry."
FUCKING AMAZING PUNT
Maybe Berry taking a couple weeks off was all he needed
THERE YOU GO
"Don't see punt returners get slaughtered much anymore, but when they do..."
Maybe Berry just needed some competition to get it together.
"James Conner runs:

5,
1,
7,
1,
16,
-6,
-5,
1,
1"
"Everyone knows that when the Steelers are playing, the definition of a catch becomes very fluid."
Can this broadcast crew be fired
Yeah let's play an ad now...
Running game is absolutely awful.
The Claypool jet sweep is becoming predictable.
Kyler Murry > Lamar Jackson
Ben is calling the plays !
Big Ebron fan
Lol this should be a 500 yard game by Ben but Randy HAS to run the ball
This offensive line has sucked for what feels like weeks now. I mean why else are we having to throw it 98% of the time?
JuJu is WR #1.....
Conner making positive yards?!
Steelers now entering the Heinz Red Zone
"Wait wait wait. SO YOU ARE TELLING ME WHEN WE PASS A SHIT TON AND MAKE THE DEFENSE GUESS, OUR RUNNING GAME WILL OPEN UP?!?! IM SHOCKED RANDY"
Oh jeez look what happens when you let Conner run down field.
Perfect pass
The steelers need to forget how to dance. And remember how to love
holy hell that's a nice in traffic catch right there
Guys. Are we good??
Is this enough of a lead for the Chicken Littles to calm the hell down?
Lasered that bitch right into to quadruple coverage to find Claypool.
"Ben spreading the love. Juju, Johnson, & Claypool all having a good day for us fantasy owners/Steelers fans lol"
Mapletron sends his regards cinci
Ben gonna request to not have practice anymore
"Expected a tighter game, but glad I was wrong

## 9 - üôÇ"
Ben better start getting at least mentioned in the MVP conversation.
Minkah almost had that
Burrows looking shaky
Ben running the offense is all we need based off that last drive. What tf is the point of Randy and his shit calls?
r/nfl is in shambles seeing there king Joe Burrow play like shit.
Still in the 3rd...!
"Look at TJ Watt.  Look at him

*B R E A T H E*"
Is it me or is this the longest game ever?
Ben is having all day to throw
If Mason comes in...I won‚Äôt pout
Can this guy shut the fuck up about his past and talk about the game?
Dammit Ben you had him
The Bengals are a bunch of dickheads not matter their record lmaoo
Bince‚Äôs hit was pure AFC North football there
That dude almost got deleted from existence.
that hit did not sound pleasant.
It‚Äôs insane how Sutton isn‚Äôt even our best slot corner
Ben absolutely should win comeback player of the year so far
somebody gonna get hurt going for these balls Ben come on keep it tight.
Blowout trivia: Dwayne Woodruff was the only active NFL player who was also a practicing attorney.
Claypool with a hammy issue...
"I love having a really tough receiver again. JuJu really reminds me of Hines Ward sometimes, and he blocks really well like Hines did too. I hope we can find a way to sign him."
ugh lmao
Smh can‚Äôt even run the ball on 3rd and 1
We're so bad at the run we need to pass on 3rd and 1?
Vilma sounds like me on madden lol
Berry is having a great game
"We're talking about sitting guys to save from injury.

Meanwhile... Bengals thread is bemoaning the announcers for acting like the game is over"
Everyone in this sub is bipolar lmao. Furious when we run the ball and malding when we pass
"It's finally the 4th quarter, boys and girls!"
I‚Äôm one Steelers score from not being able to see the end of this game.
Goddamn ray ray is SLIPPPYYYY
God damn it he‚Äôs always so close
McCloud is so fucking good
WOW that return... boy he makes me hate Switzer so much
he's so fuckin explosive it's wild when he just decided to go he's at top speed almost instantly.
McCloud got a big dick.
we luv to shit on division opponents that are orange and start with ‚ÄúB‚Äù
Ben's not going out until he gets his 4th quarter TD.
"when you're thankful for getting a three yard run, that's a bad sign for your running game lmao"
"GG guys, have a good night."
Do yourself a favor and go to the bungles sub and read the thread. The tears are flowing. Don‚Äôt be an asshole though.
Ben throwing it 50 times in a game is insane.
I love not having heart attacks on Sundays
"The way he's throwing a ball to everyone this season.

Banner 100% would have gotten a catch"
4 TDs today for the Benster.
chase is just a touchdown machine lol
Remember when people were saying Ben was holding us back? Lol
OKAY CAPTAIN FAT FUCK HANG 4 ON THEY HEAD
Ok now the game Is officially out of reach time to pull the starters
Time to bring in red nose?
Rudolph incoming
This Claypool guy is fucking amazing. I love him
"Defense with the great stop. Mcloud with the huge return. Juju with the tough third and 7. Claypool with the TD.

Like clockwork."
9-0 > Heisman QBs in AFCn.
Okay Juju and Ebron stuntin on em üò≠
"Ray Ray is a serious weapon in the kicking game. He can be a game changer in the playoffs, and he seems to get better as the season goes along."
Undefeated against Heisman winners this year.
"I mean, I‚Äôm not happy bout that lol"
Lmfao that steeler running the opposite way.
Imagine if Devin Bush was healthy. Spillane has been incredible but Bush is obviously an incredible player.
Bungles 0/12 on 3rd down rn
I mean good job on the Bengals for not just giving up completely I guess
Defense just wanted more sacks! üòÇ
Uh oh... we broke Burrow.
That was Alulu‚Äôs sack
Spillane for President at this point lol. This dude is awesome.
Jeez TJ landing on another ankle
When a meaningless field goal after a fake punt fucks up your parlay
Deandre Hopkins is a god
Nuk is a fucking amazing Receiver
Bill O‚ÄôBrien in shambles watching the end of that Cardinals game from the couch
"See ya next week, Ben. Thanks for a good game."
Nice run by Snell
Makes me wonder if we could‚Äôve had a good run game the whole time if they used Snell more
Int pretty sure Burrow already felt this loss lol
Hopkins is not human
"Well, we secured a winning record! Lets make it 16-0!"
Grande Benjamin
The Steelers haven‚Äôt played a good team /s
"Here we go. Here we go. Here we go, Steelers, here we go! Pittsburgh's going to the Super Bowl!"
There is too much negativity
Can we just all agree CBS has better production than FOX?
How was that not a safety on our kickoff after we scored the FG?!?!? The ball hit the returner In the field of play then the ball went in the end zone & he got tackled in the End zone. How is that not a safety?!?!?
Wtf is this run offense? Looks like they never played before with each other.
Are we going to win 3-0?
McCloud rides the wind!
Don‚Äôt forget guys Ben hurt his elbow last year so if he touches it it probably means he‚Äôs hurt
How the fuck do you not know Burger King has breakfast?  It's not like they just added it.
"Ok allalau has helped out the run d, but let's be real. Bush was the key I think."
Honest question. Is there an offense as conservative as the Steelers when we have a lead? Like we look like a bunch of pussies and it‚Äôs so fucking annoying.
I think I‚Äôd give Ben the 4th quarter off. Let the old man rest.
"Even though it‚Äôs not exactly connecting right now, I‚Äôm glad to see Ben throwing deep."
"snell just FEELS like he's faster. like instead of Conner who looks like an 82, snell is like an 88 or something. enough to make some progress."
"This is Ben‚Äôs flu game, shame to waste it on the Bengals"
Might be time to move on from Conner
Wtf is conner doing?
Haden has really become a quintessential Steeler. Love that guy.
Ben‚Äôs so slow lmaooo
Playing with backup fucking CBs and Ben has been killing them.. STOP CALLING FUCKING RUN PLAYS RANDY. IDGAF IF WE PASS EVERY DOWN. IF IT WORKS DONT FUCKING STOP.
"There was one blown coverage that drive. I'm not worried, just a fluke."
FINE HIS ASS!! DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR FROM THE BENGALS IN OUR HOUSE!! /s
Walmart showing us how they are profiting from people being stuck at home. Ah the holidays.
Aaaand the Conner special üôÑ
Okay can we stop complaining now? We are up two scores at halftime against a division rival in an NFL game.
Just took a glance at the r/Bengals and holy hell there is nothing but cancer and herpes over there.
Y‚Äôall want to know why teams always come back against us? It‚Äôs because we play so fucking conservative when we have a lead and give it right back to the opponents offense. We HAVE to be more aggressive when we have a lead or we are going to blow one when it matters most.
"Damn I missed the Big Ben pump fake. Hasn‚Äôt used it a bunch lately, but it‚Äôs still the best in football"
I actually really like Burrow. I hope he can continue to grow and so does our rivalry.
Prayers up to Burrow. I really like the dude.
Hopefully burrow is okay...
Steelers have 1 less win than the NFC East
"The Panthers definitely aren't gonna come back, but they just sacked Brady on 3rd down and any time Brady gets sacked it's a time for celebration"
Anyone at the stadium can tell me how the weather/ wind is? Forecast didn‚Äôt look too good
"Ok, I've got about 45 minutes of normal heart rate left before the game. time to pre-pour the victory / misery shots"
My heart is not ready yet.
"Come on Duquesne Light, let's get the power back on in time for kickoff."
"My Sunday ticket feed is music , anyone else‚Äôs?"
"As is tradition... Polamalu jersey on, Minkah jersey on the wall. Renegade blasting. LFG"
No other fan base I would rather be stressed with than y‚Äôall. Lets fucking destroy the Bungles today
"Dude, can someone give me a solid stream for this game? Crackstreams has fucking ice skating on. I'm about to pop off right now."
I‚Äôm just thankful we don‚Äôt have to hear Joe Buck. I was expecting him to be commentating.
Two afc teams on a fox broadcast is weird
Here we go! Expecting a tough game. Cincy has been competitive.
Ok there we go!
Hopefully Vilma is better than he was during Eagles game
"Steelers will receive to open the game 

HERE WE GOOOOO"
Don‚Äôt be a trap game. I beg you. LFG
"I think the high winds might actually help us today given that the Bengals strength is through the air, and they still don‚Äôt have Mixon back from injury yet."
Another week another heart attack let's goüòé
I've got the defib on hand.  LFG
Lets go man please win big for once
Good screen
How bout not throwing lobs in strong winds
‚ÄúReally quiet crowd right now‚Äù fucking idiot
Clutch ST play!!!!
Wind stole that one
BENNY SNELL FOOTBALL
JORDAN FUCKIN BERRY GOT IN THE PILE FOR A SECOND THERE
We meant to do that - it was just a special play
Conner does better when he doesn‚Äôt pull a Lev Bell. Stop hesitating so much my dude
No mans land is gonna be deeper this game.  We need to be efficient on offense.
The wind is not fun. . .
Are these plays scripted?
"Nice camera work, jagoffs"
It looks so fucking windy
"Offense needs to tighten up, but turnover converted to points is what we love to see"
Anyone get the idea that Vilma doesn‚Äôt care for the Steelers?
"Honestly I thought the playcalling was good, that's mostly on Ben and the blocking"
Why is this on fox?
Connor has looked like he‚Äôs overthinking things mid-play for a few weeks now. Keeps hesitating instead of committing to a hole
At least the hail stopped for the game
Lol the bungles
DROP IT AGAIN
Safety?!?
jesus lmao ball blown off the tee is hilarious
"Well oiled machine, these Bengal special teams."
I don't like the FOX announcers
I think the wind might be a factor today
That touched him out of the endzone right?
I feel like the bengals should have -3 points after that
man cant even hear the refs lol
So holding against the Steelers D is now not a penalty anymore
Ok 3 and out defense nice
"This game is going to be as slow as that browns game, I can feel it"
Brooks and Allen out there on that 3rd down play
wow the bengals really suck
Fine him!
Please score 7 now. Playing with a solid lead in this condition would be huge.
Man I miss having a running game.
Outside run to start it off. I am SHOCKED I tell you
why cant we run the football
Sub Conner out.
Inverse holding?
Put Mcfarland in
another drop for DJ
I miss Heath miller
fox is fucking trash. I wish every game was on cbs.
Just glad we didn‚Äôt turn the ball over there. This games going to be like 13-7 and wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a pick 6 or special teams play decides it
Anyone else surprised to see Brooks getting so much playing time?
I ‚ù§Ô∏è Ray Ray
Fox McCloud is gonna go all the way with one of these returns soon. You can just feel it in the G-Diffuser.
I really hope they can resign mccloud for cheap because I really love how he plays. I know he had issues holding onto the ball everywhere before us but he's looked super solid and reliable so far. that was 100% dead with a fair catch with Switzer but Ray Ray got a good return out of it anyway.
please put the ball in the hands of someone explosive for the love of God.
ben with the business decision block
Ben got tired
Ben really just stopped in place.
Ben with the read option
That last play made me giggle like a school girl.
Conner built different
Ben sure can't run like he use to.
Don‚Äôt the Bengals only have like 3 available CBs this game?
BEN ILL GIVE YOU MY ELBOW
Not that right elbow.  Why do all my hopes and dreams lie on an elbow?
I can‚Äôt stand these commentators bringing up Bens elbow every goddamn week.
Boz mvp!!
"Bosgod fears no wind factor


Bosgod works in mysterious ways"
Slow start was expected after a week with shitty circumstances.
I'm pretty sure wincing is Ben's resting face at this point.
Not getting tds is going to hurt us later in the game
Does every game have a ben elbow watch? Jesus
Bos 21 - bengals 10 my final score prediction
These Mayfield commercials are so stupid
We take end zone shots way too often on 3rd and mid to short. Remember that happened a lot in the 2nd half of the Titans game.
THATS THE DEEP BALLS I WANNA SEE
Beautiful
"The craziest thing is, this wind is insane. Throwing a bomb like that is insanely impressive."
James Washington runs like a damn running back lmao
Beautiful
Finally
EZ TOUCHDOWN BOYS
Good throw and catch
"DJ caught one

Ben hit a long ball

what is going on"
Am I the only one who clenches and tightens up when Ben throws the deep ball? üòÇ
Yessssssssssss
Our wideouts 1-4 are the deepest in the league man. Our 4th best dude is good as shit. I love these guys.
lets go boys!
Looked like he was surprised that the pass was there.  Glad he pulled it in.
LETS GO
lol barely saw it
Wind doesn‚Äôt  affect bens bullets
LETS GO TD DIONTE
Why throw a fade if you're gonna go for two
Wind be damned!
Damn we smoked them that drive
bens deep balls and johnson are looking good today
Chase please be ok :(
"01 offense, empty set, Ben calls the shots. Unfortunate but that‚Äôs all that works."
Ben faking a injury is like when Lewis Hamilton on team radio goes ‚Äúmy tiers are finished‚Äù Then turn to god mode.
I hope was just landing on his hip vs landing with arm extended and it be the shoulder
I think they told Burrow to just get rid of the ball.  Don't let TJ smell you.
Bosgod has made 24 straight FGs and that's the longest active streak in the NFL as per Bill Hillgrove
Whoops
jesus spillane that was one of the most obvious ones I've ever seen lol
FUMBLE
LFG BOYS !!!!
Nice strip!!!!
2nd of .......6 turn overs
GIMME DAT
LETS GOOOOOODOODODODOROTOTHSVERBDBD
tyler Boyd is a big strong maaaan
HAHAHAAHAH BUNGLES R DOG SHIT
"Cam Sutton said ""gimme"""
Rip Conner
‚ÄúKicked themselves in the foot‚Äù?
holy shit what a clean strip lmao
"Im goin to say, Cam Sutton has been legit with the opportunities he has been givin."
Jesus this is a high school game basically
How is this team so bad at blocking for the run? Conner is almost always getting hit behind the line.
Our run blocking is so ass
these run attempts are absolutely brutal
‚ÄúKicked themselves in the foot‚Äù
boy I sure love that they keep running the same hideous power runs and getting destroyed over and over again
This run game is trash oline has really regressed this year
Ben getting warm. Curtains for the league when this happens
All day to throw
Well my heart came to a full stop on that one.
Berry good
Ben needs to throw some more pump fakes to avoid the passes getting batted down imho.
"Wait, you don't have to just fuck around in the backfield?"
"Anyone else think it's a total fucking dick move that ads try to hijack your in-home AI? 

I don't even use that sort of stuff and I find it annoying as hell. Like imagine if an ad just opened Google and looked shit up."
DL not getting enough pressure for me. They need to send another guy
Damn classic slant td
"~~I was hoping for a sack but I'll take a throw away so they settle for a field goal.~~

Or we can let them score on 4th down..."
time for the offense to look alive
Fuck off
It‚Äôs Benny snell football time
Never seen anyone love anything as much as Burrow loves licking his hands
JUJU!
That's good JuJu
"I don‚Äôt really agree with that penalty tbh, but I‚Äôll take it"
Don't rough up Ben unless you want him to do even better.
"Personal fouls and bengals, name a better duo"
Wrapping claypool up because you can‚Äôt handle him
Knock knock knockin' on Bungles' door
Claypool draws insane contact I swear. He is owning these rookies.
Very nice of the Bengals defense to help us march up the field this drive. Thanks bengalbros.
"I know it's vilma's first year but he makes me miss chris simms, and I don't like saying that."
Just plain do not want to run power. Brought Watt on for that. Fuck this play calling
Jumbo Package. Lol
"Sam Hubbard‚Äôs face was more apologetic than argumentative. I think it was a case where he knew he fucked up. Hell, when he was lying on his back, he was grabbing his helmet...he knew he drew the flag."
Juju ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I don't know why, but that pass scared the shit out of me."
And that‚Äôs just one reason why we‚Äôre the best in the league
I thought that was a terrible pass when it left his hand. Glad I was wrong.
Respect my quarterback
Juju for the win.
He just did that HE JUST DID THAT
"This MFer just said that DPI play was a smart play by the defender. Yeah, brilliant to give your opponent a new set of downs on the 5."
ben Roethlisberger is a big maaaaaan
What a fucking throw
LETS GOOOOO JUJU
My stream is like 3 years behind the actual game.  I see Juju comments from. 5 minutes ago. Nice TD anyway!
Okay so can we start seeing some pressure from our Dline?
Is that mason rudolph sitting in the stands
"Juju scores


Give ball to fan


Mark Madden punching the air"
Kenny Albert is worse than every CBS play-by-play announcer
Lol I guess its too much to ask the broadcast to recognize Juju's parents
Everytime the ref turns on his mic I think my door blew open.
"There it is, streak intact."
There‚Äôs my sack
COOK HIS ASS TJ!!
Diontae Johnson is good at football.
Joe burrow is learning the hard way lol
"Dread it, run from it, TJ Watt arrives in the backfield all the same"
Diontae having a day today
That Ebron route would‚Äôve literally killed Heath at that speed.
This is a 9-0 team!
EBRON!
Did the Bengals just forget about Diontae on that play?
"He just keeps talking about how the successful AFC north teams can run, meanwhile we have 200+ passing yards and like 30 rushing yards. Maybe stop talking about it?"
Stop. Running. East. To. West
Ben is fucking slinging that ball.
for literally one second I thought ebron broke something and I got scared
Deonte is a fucking stud
Ben's on pace for 55 freaking throws this game..this run game needs figured out.
DJ is fucking on it today
Johnson is already over 100 yards today. God damn!!
im so done with these connor stretch runs
Put Benny in man
James Conner is just a false start penalty back us up another five yards
Joe Burrow looks like Pennywise the Clown without makeup
Man Connor needs to learn to cut up field and take a yard over these 5+ yard losses where he runs backwards to get around a block.
This isn't just Conner's fault y'all. Their DL is swallowing us
"Drive was going great, then a shit run to the outside. Just let Ben throw 60 times a game, it's our best shot."
This running game...No words actually.
Why not just run up the middle with Conner
You know...Maybe let Conner run it up the middle.
Hey so maybe try runs that aren't lateral 5 yards behind the Line of scrimmage?
Run game sucks but lateral runs def aint it
Conner when given an option or zone takes it outside 9/10 times and it almost never works
See see these shittt runs just give Ben more space to throw. All part of the plan boys.
Let's let Connor the slower of the backs to try and run outside the tackles and then let little Snell be our short yard down back? What is that logic
Why do we not have Snell in there 50% of the time???
I‚Äôm gonna go to the Steelers bench and rip every running play out of that playbook
Boswell is just fucking automatic
Shout out to Bosgod for kicking 3/3 in a tornado today
Our guys just smacked heads there. Hayward looking jarred
How do they not call that hold on Watt all year long?
Ugh cmon call something aggressive
I'm confused offensive lineman allowed to wrap their arms around defensive players throats?
Whats up with the holding on Watt
Burrow didn‚Äôt tried the experience of an interception today? He should try now...
this soft ass coverage makes me wanna throw up
Mondeaux does not make me comfortable
How is that not called a hold every time?!
Watt saved points if our D can stop them on 3rd
Huge sack
I wish TJ would tell at a red every once in a. while. he's being put in a fucking sleeper hold and it doesn't matter
HELL YEA WE NEEDED THAT BOI
"every time my stream freezes, the bungles do something big and its pissing me off"
WOOOoooo TJ!!! My man.
Lmao that was a classic Bungles play
Very solid half of football
Good half despite the shit play calling. Hopefully we can replicate the defensive success and let Ben call some plays in the second half
"DAE Tomlin should be on the hot seat for taking this long to go 8-0??????


/s"
Uhhh why isn‚Äôt TJ in?
way to wrap it up Haden!
Joe Haden is a great tackler for a DB
Haden having himself a game.
Haden is an animal
Outside run for a loss time üòàüòà
Run run pass punt
Our run blocking is terrible
FUCK THE RUN GAME ITS NOT WORKING THROW THE BALL
We love not converting don't we?
Beautiful fucking punt
Run run pass should be our nickname
That was a nice hit off the punt.
Best kick of his career.
It's actually unbelievable how bad the run game is.
"Beautiful punt, beautiful tackle...well done."
Very pleased with Berry since his return.
"911, yes. I just witnessed a murder"
Not sure why were still trying to run the ball so much. We've had like one good run all game. Our passing game has been FAR better.
I think he caught it
Falcons sub gotta be the only other team to act like us when we in the lead lmfao
that‚Äôs a catch
Thanks for all the replays fox.
That ball bobbles big time. He got the toe dragged but he never has full possession.
two great replay angles thus far.
Seems like a catch to me unless they say he didn't have control for the first foot
"Ball moved a lot, but then this is the NFL and no one knows what a catch is"
"Honestly at this point, I don't think I know what a catch is"
"Did anyone ever explain why the play from the first half was not a safety?

Because he touched the ball in play, outside of the end zone, and then had to go into the end zone to get it and got tackled, I thought it would be a safety.

Can someone explain it to me just so I understand?

Thanks!

Finally a Steeler game that I have not had to take any tums :-)

Go STEELERS!"
"He got one foot in, then he adjusted and got the other foot in. I don't think it's a catch"
im cool with whatever
Fox is Almost as bad as ESPNs NFL coverage. Almost
A potential turnover and fucking fox has a commercial on.
"*and now this, from Lowes*"
These first down play calls are abysmal.
STOP RUNNING THE FUCKING BALL. ITS NOT FUCKING WORKING
[deleted]
Get Randy the fuck away from this team please
Please for the love of all that is fuck STOP RUNNING ON FIRST AND 10
FIRST DOWN BABY
[deleted]
"""Alright Ben, you can have your Superbowl, but we'll have to have two terrible running plays every set of downs.""

-NFL probably"
STOP ASKIMG ABOUT THE RUN GAME WE DON'T NEED IT
"Vilma is so annoying, we heard you the first fifty times"
like....imagine not having Ben this year....holy shit what a waste it would be with this D
Eazy-E with THE catch!!
This fucking announcer is aggravating. He's done nothing but talk shit on our offense not being good enough to beat good defenses. We literally just beat the ravens.
Man Ebron have saved our bacon a few times
Remember all those colts and lions fans saying ebron cant catch?
"Ebron only has 2 catches, but both were big time 3rd down conversions."
Ebron the type of dude to drop a 2 yard pass but make the hardest catches
god that first huge touchdown for Claypool this year has led to me expecting it to happen more and my balls are blue for it.
"So happy with Ebron this year, can live with a drop here and there for his production. Great signing"
That spin was fucking smooooooth
Vance better be available for the Baltimore game... cannot run anything outside with him not setting the edge.
God this camera work is fucking terrible.
"Wow, a rare running gain. Nice."
What a throw and catch
Conner checked this thread at half-time haha
James channeling his inner Mendy with that spin
AIR CANADA üá®üá¶
TOO EASY!
Is there a better pump fake than Ben?
Bengals sub is about as positive as our running game
I think this claypool kid *might* be good at football...
The guy who sells me my heart attack pills is furious right now.
MAPLETRONNN
The combat catch!
Maple leafs out for ya boi üçÅüçÅüçÅüçÅüçÅ
Mapletron!
We are seeing tonight why we are undefeated. We are a good team when we do what we have to do. This game has been our best game in a while
Maybe everyone panicking when we tried that two point conversion was overreacting.
"Mapletron!!! K, enjoy drinking the rest of this game away Nation. It's over."
"Bengals: How are we gonna get out of this hole?

Taylor: We'll dig our way out!

Steelers: *Scores*

Taylor: Not like that! Dig up stupids!"
/u/thedudeabides50‚Äôs kid predicted that TD in his pregame analysis
Chase Claypool is such a beast goddamn.
Let us thank the Bengals for a less than usual stressful week of Steelers football
Bengals giving every Steelers fan lower blood pressure.
Mayfield just hoping we believe this bullshit that ain't his body.
Hold them here get another one and sit Ben
"The way the scoreboard marker is, it looks like the Bengals have -7."
i like how im not stressed out too much right now. i could get used to this.
CAN THIS MF SHUT UP
"They interfere with our receivers almost every play, luckily they are calling it today for once."
"Yeah if we score here, rest ben and free mason"
Johnson was gonna get nailed if he caught that
"He slowed down, rookie mistake"
"Big Ben and over throws, so hot this game."
Jesus Vince Williams hits people like a fucking train.
"dolphins game over

buf az under 5 in 4th

den radiers 10 min left in 4th

steelers 1 min left in third."
I heard that hit all the way from Germany!!
defense having FUN out there
That graphic of Ben was a bit generous tbh
Hadens hair is really something
Haven't checked yet... have Bengals fans pivoted to the usual groveling for the moral victory yet? Whining about the refs and how our players are all criminals bullying their gentle mom and pop club of boy scouts?
Looks like Washington needs a TD now
I don‚Äôt think Claypool is great at locating the deep ball.
We'll get a deep pass one of these days...
Time for a James Washington TD
Did JuJu just stand up a LB that was trying to light him up?
Juju took a helmet to helmet hit and just kept trucking.
"Juju is a beast man, ate that hit and got him some yds"
I‚Äôd Let Ben rest after this drive
Juju is STRONG and we been using him on 3rd downs akin to AB‚Äôs old go to role. Wonder if we kee Juju after this year :/ I‚Äôd like to
Juju is tough
RUN THE BALL
this Bates kid is a problem
WHAT A PUNT
"Holy fuck if he catches that, we have a game again."
Berry‚Äôs having such a good game
Punting has been stellar today!
Wtf that wouldve rolled to the line!
The punting has been incredible. He is getting serious power in these kicks.
Good punt.
3rd week in a row Ben dodged a bullet with that kind of throw.
Berry! Is! A! God!
LETS GET A SAFETY
Why's he throwing these fade away floaters?
"Let‚Äôs get a safety!! Let‚Äôs go TJ, Bud, Cam, Tuitt, somebody!!!"
Can these announcers please fuck off
Vilma relax you dweeb
Who is our guy without a mask ...gonna get fined
Berry is suddenly a great punter and I love it.
Imma miss Bud
"This is more of a general NFL question than a Steelers specific...but why, when games are pretty much in control, does Ben not come out of the game? Seems like it‚Äôs NOT the norm for the NFL - qbs play the whole game - but it‚Äôs not the norm in other sports. You see aging players, Lebron etc etc, take a seat to avoid injury and wear/tear in ‚Äúblowouts‚Äù

Anybody know why this doesn‚Äôt happen in the NFL? You think this would be a perfect time for the 2nd team QB to come in for a few series."
Rayrayrayrayray!!!
It seems like he is so close to a touchdown every single return
The man so nice they named him twice!!!!
My goodness McCloud is a beast.
We sure got the short straw for the commentary crew.
What I‚Äôd give to have Myron Cope doing the color.
Ryan Switzer in shambles once again
Juju on 3rd down‚úÖ
What is that hand thing Juju keeps doing?
"Damn Bengals suck chant

Our fans are some savages hahah"
I love Hines Ward 2.0
Bengals sub in shambles
I‚Äôm now designating 3rd downs as 3rd and JuJu!
We love the sweeeeeeeep
Now...Rudolph time
Ben Roethlisberger is the Cincinnati Bengals‚Äô father
we are the best football team in history
Fucking Claypool. This dude better plant his ass on our roster and never fucking leave.
Man I am so glad we drafted Claypool!!
chase is now at one touchdown per game
God damn. Claypool already has NINE TDs this year.
I think I speak for everyone when I say that I would much rather see Dobbs than the reindeer
Such a good game all around. Only thing is the run. We have 32 total running yards
It's time for the Mason handoff show
I would like to thank the gods for giving me TWO games this year i can be relaxed in the 4th Qtr....they have spoiled me this year & I appreciate them for it
It‚Äôs nice not to have a stroke this week
"I‚Äôd really like more sacks

Edit: there we go"
Mason time
My heart appreciates this performance this week
Williamson sighting!
"has avery even, like, played this game?"
Stop that. You already lost. Let me get ready for work in peace.
Woah not gonna lie... that was cool lol
Spillane baby!
Free sack stats baby
#SACK NO. 4
Why tf would you kick a field goal there lol
HAHA BUNGALS YOU THOUGHT
oof for burrow. I wonder how many qb hits there have been because I've seen him get up off the ground waaayyy too many times.
I hope he‚Äôs alright
That field goal is them officially throwing in the towel
HOPKINS HOLY SHIT
We have lit the victory cigar.
Are the Bengals' rush defense good or is our rush game that bad?

Two trains of thought?
Anyone else think we should give the ball to Snell more?
"Let's be honest, steelers needed this, you needed this I did, hell everyone needed this....except Bengals, and I'm ok with it."
My cardiac doctor thanks tthis team this week.
Ah yes. The classic Steelers move of dominating the game everywhere except the scoreboard
"I'd cut off my pinky to never see another ""at home with baker mayfield"" commercial"
Why does it seem like Ben has had so many batted passes this season? Does it have sometime to do with the way he throws now post elbow surgery?
How the fuck is the Masked Singer still a thing? Especially during a pandemic.
"Imagine a high powered offense paired with our defense. 

I have to stop thinking about it..."
I hate our playcalling so much
"It‚Äôs not a safety because the returner didnt have possession of it before the end zone.  Dumb rule, but that‚Äôs what it is"
Can someone explain why that wasn‚Äôt a saftey
"I'm getting close to my ""not wanting to see James"" run phase"
RAY RAY!!
So glad Switzer isn't returning punts anymore lol
"The cumin, the coriander, it's so tender. It gets me hard. Then I cum. It's bomb steak"
remember like 7 minutes ago when all you guys were shitting on the offense. just have some damn patience.
"Bengals are so bad, we‚Äôre doing everything better statistically but are struggling. Only the Steelers"
Outside run to Conner for a loss of 4 comin up üò§üò§üî•üî•
Go forward James. FORWARD.
"Why do y‚Äôall keep blaming Conner? Lmao pay attention to what‚Äôs going on. The OL was blown back before he could get around the edge. He‚Äôs a north south rb, blame the OC for calling a stretch play with a slow back"
Diontae either making a huge play or falling down
Can't run against two of the worst run defenses in the league. That's fucking pathetic. What's the excuse?
"Oh the pass game is working for you? Let's go back to run, run, pass to show how anemic our offense can be. Every week Fitchner"
Lol idgaf what anyone says. Ben not in the MVP conversation is ridiculous.
[deleted]
Can we RUN THE FOOTBALL? Our star receivers getting up limping because we refuse to even try to run the ball up 22.
"'He's making us old guys look good.'

Do you mean the old guys still playing or the ones who haven't been playing for awhile?"
Anyone else kind of want to see Mason come in sometime soon?
Announcers actively rooting against our boys at this point.
I hope Burrow is ok. I still don‚Äôt like the Bengals but I like Burrow. He‚Äôs the best college QB I‚Äôve ever seen
"That's stupid feel these losses

Vilma saying nothing but bullshit"
Can one of your mods please fucking ban all the morons from here that are spamming the game thread in r/Bengals
Imagine risking our players health in a blowout
"Wanna see me overthrow Claypool?


Wanna see me do it again?"
"The victim complex in their game thread is fucking hilarious. Every Steeler is committing a penalty on every play, the NFL sucks our dicks, the refs are letting us injure them, and on, and on, and on."
Can we get an OC that knows what plays to call at the right time? For fuck sake.
Anyone that defends Randy is a joke. It‚Äôs 1st and 20... why not try to run a play where they can get 10-15 yards to make 2nd down more manageable...
Was Randy Fichtner responsible for that drop?
It's so disappointing that we can't run the ball
Idk why we treat DJ as our WR 1. Juju is our best WR.
Alright let‚Äôs get a damn touchdown now. Great field position. Let‚Äôs go!
Love Ray Ray
"I have the Steelers -7, why do I feel like this game is going to end 6-0?"
I hope Bens elbow stays ok.
"Notice how Ben holds the tablet! His right elbox is clearly hurting because it is at a slightly shallower angle than the other!

-Fox, probably"
I still think Dobbs is better than Mason.
Did Ben‚Äôs throwing motion change? He has so many balls batted
Steelers football it‚Äôs never a easy game shame if you thought otherwise
lmao wow. Another Conner run to the outside and another loss of 5 yards.
I‚Äôm not sure that Randy‚Äôs experience as a QB coach really lends itself to calling good run plays
Yes GMC. It is so common for people to buy cars for each other on Christmas. . .
"Randy...for the love of god please pass the fucking ball and don‚Äôt be a conservative bitch. If you are going to run a running play, please run it into the middle and not outside. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Man If Fitzpatrick would have caught that, he would‚Äôve looked just like Palamalu with that dive!"
"It's been 8 weeks now, Ben should be better with his deep throws but he's still overthrowing by a lot."
Vilma gets paid per word.
"We get it, Johnathan."
Why does this 3rd and 1 scare me so much?
"Vilma saying ""we"" in reference to the bengals. Jesus christ the bias"
What do you mean ‚Äúwe‚Äù Kemosabe?
"Cincinnati is really trying to get burrow killed.  Just put in the 2nd string man, its over."
Seems rude to put Rudolph in and not even let him throw the ball
"Back to back 3 and outs vs the Bengals. Why does Randy Fichtner have a job? 
Edit: Already forgot about our lone first down."
[deleted]
"Why did Fichtner allow the pass to be blocked >:(

FAHR TAHMLEN"
Yo this classic smooth jazz on buffstream is legit. Do this during ads.
"Little Joey Burrow about to be sacked 10 times. I guarantee it. Double digit sack day, or I riot."
Crackstreams has figure skating on? They have the NBC feed up??
The weather here in Pittsburgh is windy as fuck but it stopped raining at least. Let's go Stillers!!!
Bens beard is perfect at this length.  Looks full and  great  while not making him look like a homeless man.
My heart is pounding ugh.
That's not how you wanna start the game.
Ben already calling plays?
"Of course, punt"
ST redemption run
P L A N N E D
Is that the wind orrrr
Snell is such a gamer on special teams
3rd and manageable...chuck it deep
Lot of yinz acting like wind isn‚Äôt a thing.
We have some of the worst offensive play calling in the nfl I'm so fucking sick of the hail marys on 3rd and short
Was about to complain about Ben trying a deep ball with this wind... but then the Bungels cough up a punt... so whatever.  Stop the deep balls in this wind regardless
"That out of bounds moon ball on third down was all part of the plan. Ben used his mind powers to force the punt returner to fumble. Therefore, by the transitive property, that was a completed pass."
I gotta stop checking the thread watching my slow streams. Ruined the surprise.
Conner looks amazing one game and not-amazing the next.  Never know what to expect.
Please score a TD here
"If we‚Äôre going to run east/west, use McFarland. Use Conner and Snell for North/South. Conner has the best hands for pass catching"
"With it being so windy, they really need to establish the run game."
I feel like he only gets yards on those this year. he looks like hes running in mud when he has to go horizontally on the field
Our third down offense is just.... something else.
I‚Äôll take it
"Bungles gonna Bungle.  

Good start!"
That was soft not going for it on 4th and 1 there.
Bosgod lmao I like it
"Yeah I guess its pretty windy outside here also, im like 2 hours from Pittsburgh"
[deleted]
I just don't like Kenny Albert.
So it's going to be one of these games....
Lmao what took them so long to get down the field smh. Could‚Äôve had that
Bungles gotta Bungle
When did the Bengals player touch the ball? Doesn‚Äôt that determine whether it‚Äôs a safety or touchback
This game is FOR SURE going to be a shit show.
Bungles are a disaster
well that was the stupidest touch back of all time lmao
Wasn't a false start... People just getting blown over
"Looking at that wind and rain, I‚Äôm sure glad I‚Äôm inside with a cup of warm black tea."
it seems for the first time my stream is actually ahead of the others in this thread based on the comments lmao
i love how that ref pronounces ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù especially when he says it against the bengals
Wish we could over turn that
"With the wind blowing, need to run and run some more."
Ben looking for a block to throw gets me everytime
they call that hold but not the rear naked chokes on Watt. right.
The oline needs to get space for Connor.
"Quit throwing to receivers hands, Ben!"
DJ has to catch that
This offense reminds me of last week. You think they would come out doing a little better
Why does our offense suck
Dionte has so much potential but bad drops and injuries have really held him back
Also once. And only once. Conner how about you don‚Äôt put you head down and see what happens in the game when hitting the gap. 0 game intelligence and awareness
Why do they let the play continue
Ben was like nah chill lmao
"Ayyy, exotic run"
These guys have obviously not seen the blocks Ben has laid the past few years
Big Ben pretending like he's gonna throw a block.
"Yes, more runs like that JC"
Good shit JC
Fix the stream come on fox
Do we love Connor now or do we hate on him some more?
BOZGAWD
Hopefully we don‚Äôt regret these field goals.
ill take an all fg game
This fucking game man
Hope Ben will be ok
Somebody should tell Ben you don‚Äôt need a TD on every third down lol.
So sick of commercials
It's gonna be hard to throw a touchdown today with these conditions
Juju was coming open and probably would've had a TD there.
bosgod remains infallible
"Never missed against Cinci, I like that statistic.  Really sticks it to them"
Vilma is starting to piss me off
All the youtube videos I've watched have made me expect players to step out of bounds and touch the ball in that kickoff situation. Whew
"Today's fortune cookie reads:

> Many opportunities are open to you, if you seek them out.

Sage words during a pandemic."
how do I add a number and player name to my username?
That was nice Tomlin gave the bengals player a little butt slap lol
3 straight 3 and outs and the pressure still hasn‚Äôt really gotten there. This is a really good signZ
a catch!
[deleted]
YAAAAAAS DJ!!! There‚Äôs that deep ball baby
What a fucking pass
Deep ball alertüö®
Let‚Äôs go!!!!
That should shut fox up
Still 1st qtr? Almost been an hour lol
"So much for ""Ben can't throw a deep ball anymore""."
HOLY SHIT IT WORKED
Such a great play. Opens up the playbook.
FUCK YEA DJ
YES
DJ !!!
BeNS eLbOW
So we should go deep on 1st not 3rd? Okayyyyy
And you guys were just making fun of Johnson
Yesss! The passing game has woken up!
Diontae's sigh of relief was every collective Steeler fans' sigh of relief.
"Dionte is a monster, Thank you coach drake. All love"
Ben said fuck this wind
Didn‚Äôt someone earlier say Johnson had stone hands? Looked good snagging that throw
WE DEY
Let's go! That's the Ben we know & love. Looked better than any drive last week.
HE CAUGHT IT!
QUICK HANDS
"Fuck, hopefully Mapletron is ok."
Finally thorough the scripted plays?  Let Ben do his thing
God no
Claypool didn‚Äôt even try to jump on that jump ball
Looked like he just got the wind knocked out of him. Hopefully
3 play TD drive
josh dobbs and ben :)
Jeez it's still the first quarter? Wow this is going to be a slowwwww game
"Sometimes, it‚Äôs just a timing error"
Sutton was like 2 inches too short
This is what happens when you disrespect the terrible towel.
LMAOOOOOOOOOO
 No Avery Williamson today??
FUMBLEEEEEEEEEEEEE
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO! CAM STUNTIN ON EM SUTTON!
GOOD FUCKING PLAY CAM SUTTON
Textbook strip
Riiiiiiiiip it out
Noice
"Oh, wow.  Our boys are feeling confident today."
WHAT A STRIP
Did we just lose 8 yards on a first down run?
Connor what the hell are you doing?
And that‚Äôs why we should keep Sutton over Hilton
"Sutton been stripping the ball a lot lately, good play. And way to make up for that mistake"
I'll say it once again they never should of messed with the terrible towel this is what happens.
I'm listening to the radio broadcast - who are the announcers? One of them is literally Captain Obvious stating the most obvious things and it's quite annoying but it's better than the shitty fox announcers
why does Burrow have the biceps of Thor in his cartoon drawing LMAOOO
I love this Defense.
Sutton having a great year
How many Bengals does it take to bring down James Conner?
Fichtner: ‚Äúwell the passing has worked very well so let‚Äôs just keep running it‚Äù
"Just a friendly reminder, fellas. 

Defense. Wins. Championships"
I haven‚Äôt seen him but if this game continues it‚Äôs current trajectory I expect he will make an appearance
That whole sequence from the Defense sniffing out everything Burrow was trying to do and the strip right after was just... *chef's kiss* I love Steeler football.
I really wish Dotson could play LG I like Feiler a lot but Dotson I way better
That first quarter was hella long
Our WR core are just work horses.
How the fuck is Jersey Shore still relevant? Who is watching this shit?
Damn Johnson was open too
I fucking love James Washington
THREADING THE NEEDLE
Jesus flying Christ is Ben telegraphing his throws or something?
That was a vintage big ben play
Berry has been pretty good since he came back
did anybody see Claypool out there on any of those plays?
It seems like Ben is pretty regularly arguing with DJ?
Uggghhhh
How?
We rush 3 and that guy is that wide open???
I'm amazed this line has kept Burrows clean so far
Sack him now
well thats not optimal
Could we get some fucking pressure?
"Bro, these fox announcers are the worst"
Have we even come close to a sack yet?
What‚Äôs going on with the pass rush? Bad game for the front 7?
Burrow‚Äôs being smart. Getting rid of the ball very quickly. We need to make him feel the pressure
Is it me or did the 49ers look so bright that they were glowing? lmaooooo
:(
Fucking Ocho Cinco
Well fuck
We got worked there
"Horrible, too easy of a 4th down"
"Girl: This is better than what I usually eat in the morning.

Interviewer: What do you usually eat?

Girl: ... Nothing..."
At least it looks like Claypool is back
"as usual, the announcers blow"
Nobody cares about this guy
MAPLETRON!
Can ben start calling the plays again please?
Good play call be them. Let‚Äôs get back on offense and control this game
For some reason I picture Chase Claypool jumping out of a plane with a parachute.
Claypool is becoming our go-to-in-a-crunch guy.
"What do you tell your defence to prepare for 11?


Chase claypool


I'll see myself out"
Johnson is weird
Thats Mr. Smith-Schuster.  He deserves respect.
I swear people trying to hurt Ben now
Nice catch juju
JUJU
JuJu nice climb baby
Don't rough our passer bro.
Do we like this P.I. ?
"Wow, big Ben never gets that call"
Cmon chase
Should‚Äôve caught that bullet
I thought Ben might run that in for a moment
"Ben is taking me the fuck out, I just wanna see big man rumble and use the hit stick üòÇ"
"Dpi and Claypool, name a better duo"
That route was FILTHY
There's a special kind of pleasure that comes when you realize the radio is perfectly synced up with the tv audio because the refs lips move in time to what you're hearing. I'm sure there's a word for it in German.
"Bro, I swear every team pass interferes with chase almost every time he doesn't catch the ball. They usually don't call it either."
"If you‚Äôre gonna bring in your FB, give the FB the damn ball. Fly sweeps are too easy to notice otherwise"
LETS GOO JUJUUU
Alot of balls right through hands today.
"Right thru his hands

Edit: Wow I‚Äôm really behind lol"
Fichtner is so laughably bad
"With all these penalties, I really hope this doesn't turn into the Burfict/Pacman Jones meltdown 2.0 game. As great as it was to see them implode, I don't want any of our guys getting hurt."
These calls are terrible. They have no faith in our run
Damn. Great play.
And here comes a touchdown.
Ben threw that with some heat on it
That guy tried to hit Ben late
 LETS GO
Let's goooooooooo!
Damn Ben I see you
That is what Ben needs to do!
 VOODOO JUJU
Vintage Ben moment. What a job!
"If you‚Äôre initially willing to go for 2, you should be going for 2 a second time. Part of the calculus of going for it is your confidence in making up for a miss by going for 2 again, no?"
Ben looking so clean right now
"So that sweep call was really bad... in general its done well all season... but you put Watt outside like hes a Tight End... and run to him.  There is no disguise or mystery doing that, it was painfully telegraphed.  

Aside from that, it was a good drive."
Ben with 180 yards already üò≥
Cam Sutton has forced a fumble in three straight games. Dat boi showin up
Assist to the Bengals for generally being undisciplined. Some things never change
That dude was so pissed he didn't get the ball
Kenny Albert looks like his headset is way too tight.
"That last drive woke Burrow up lol, defense gotta get some pressure on his ass"
Burrow is pretty good
"Pressure is not getting there, and burrow is simply hitting the first or second read."
"Burrow will be a problem for us in the future, maybe even now"
Sack streak is extended
SACK STREAK ALIVEE
There we go.
LET TJ RUSH LETS GO
Ya'll need to relax with these spicy takes of doubting we'll get a sack this game. IT'S THE SECOND QUARTER
Streak alive
There it is
YES!
FINALLY DLINE. ITS TIME TO FUCKING EAT.
About time we got a sack
"Watt saying,""hello, and I'll be right back."""
Smart move by Ray Ray not to touch that ball
**TJ!!!!!**
First sack of hopefully many today!
Let's put the dagger in here
Do we get another 7 on the board before the half?
DJ having a game
DJ awareness 99
Benjamin Todd
Be is really slinging it
Ebron with a helluva catch
KEEP FEEDING EM
They‚Äôre CLICKING
Im liking this no 3rd down drive
"Hey Ben, I dare you to throw for 500 yards again."
Ben is starting to light it up
Ebron is a fucking beast.
The run designs are not very great
the amount of weapons Ben has makes me sick
"'WIDE OPEN JOHNSON""  well he was 3 yards behind the line... not crazy tough to be open there LOL"
Are we allergic to running it up the middle?
"Jesus, Johnson and Mary!!!"
Run between the tackles... geez.
I think our WR core Is better than 3 or 4 teams WRs combined.
Why the actual fuck are we running?
James is just lost right now
Why does he bounce so far outsideüë∫
Conner running sideways on every play... just pound the rock guy
Idk who is calling the plays (Ben or Fichtner) but I'm glad we've seemed to finally accept the fact that we can't run the ball well lol.
Fichtner and really bad run calls. What a team.
"Lets gooo, Johnson has 116 yards in first half"
Where's willie parker when u need him
Line isn't really giving Conner much of a chance so far
Our run blocking is not great..
Just run it up the gut if you‚Äôre gonna run it
We need a run game coordinator. Munchak leaving two years ago has really shown it‚Äôs effect on this team‚Äôs play designs on the run game
Somebody tell Connor he isn‚Äôt fast. Run forward my man
That outside run isn‚Äôt working with the grass this wet. Stahp pls.
"Where‚Äôs that Steelers fan that got into a long argument with me claiming that Conner is good? Crickets man, the dude is so ineffective"
I wonder how many times a game fichtner thinks ‚Äúit‚Äôll definitely work *this* time‚Äù
Lol they told the line to make sure Conner had a bad year so we can sign him next year.
Got. Away. With. That.
"I dont care if Boswell needs to kick 10 FG this game.

A win is a win."
Bozgawd
Man a TD would have been great there
What is Heyward doing in on the offensive field goal unit?
Just stop running the ball it‚Äôs a drive killer every. Time.
"Who started false?

Edit: brillint"
Is the game thread not updating for anyone else?
"66 straight games with a sack, fam. 

TB currently has the record with 69 (nice)"
"Ayy guys, were winning, so don't get to annoyed."
Bet cam's concussed
Defense wtf
Did Heyward just get concussion on that collision?
Who is brooks?
Watt being held around his neck hah
This is some horrible defense
Sakurai turned tripping on this week.
Fuck this soft shit
Cam laying in him lol
"If you can't have a beard like Kiesel, have some flow like that."
Choke hold on Watt uncalled... its like Harrison is here once more
TJ¬°!!!!!!!!!
TJ WAAAAAAAT
Lol holy shit TJ
Sack
Why did we just let them drive 50 yards in a minute
maybe we should have some O Linemen drag the refs across the field by their throats to see whether or not it‚Äôs a penalty
TJ GOD DAMN WATT AGAIN!!!!
"Watt says, ""told you I'd be right back."""
Lol so annoying watching our guys get held ridiculously every play with no calls
TJ like shit I gotta get back
TJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
GREAT PLAY TJ YES
fucking hell yeah TJ
They should retire 25 but not in a good way. Makes me nervous seeing a DB in it
Cincy is gonna throw a sideline pass about 10 yards . Force a throw into the middle
Pick 6
Man the Bengals are embarrassing
Panthers you had one job...
16 rushing yardsü§Æ
Wtf happened to our Run defense?!
Come on put them away this half
"Vilma has one thing to talk about, dude just repeats himself constantly"
Joe Haden having a night
But our secondary is trash
haha keep throwing to haden if ya want I guess.
We‚Äôre gonna get a block this game.
"Ok offense, your turn."
That kick was almost blocked. That ball probably almost split atoms with how close that was.
Can we stop running it holy crap
"We need Fitzmagic.

He would bolster our RB unit.."
These announcers are really annoying me
STOP FUCKING RUNNING
The line men need to be in a three point stance to fire off on the run blocks
The ole run up the gut for one yard. Run outside for no gain. Short pass behind the sticks.
We should just go empty set every play.
Our run blocking is abysmal.
[deleted]
Winds at Heinz blowing covid out of PA
The amount of people here who think the coaches are out there running the ball or telling Ben exactly who to throw to is too damn high.
I‚Äôm personally thrilled we ran on first and second down for a combined two yards
Jesus Christ that was a hard hit
How do you not fumble that.
Special teams KILLING IT TODAY
Not watching the game but keeping up with the thread.. how‚Äôs our O-line and linebackers looking ?
Aside from Berry's first punt this season... hes been quite good
Wind must be behind him
Berry has been good
"Ah, the Steeler's Special: run, run, pass, punt."
Justin Lane would be the absolute coolest running back name of all time
Why is the last play not updating on this thread?
Why hasn‚Äôt the score/time updated here yet?
Do we know we‚Äôre only up 15? In the early 3rd?
We clearly can‚Äôt  put teams away lmao
That‚Äôs a catch unfortunately
I dont think he had control
"He had to resecure the catch, might not be enough to overturn but what a grab"
LOOKS LIKE IT BOBBLED!!!
The Steelers seem to do very well in these slow tempo games
HE BOBBLED THE BALL WHEN HE HIT THE GROUND
Feet are in but he had no control. Incomplete
Looks like the ball hits the ground.
The ball isn‚Äôt secure. Not a catch.
My guess is this call stands
Two feet but not control with two. Great effort though
Hard to tell. The call should stand in that case
No catch
Incomplete
Plz no fumble. Fuck these commercials
Please no. . . .
Love the smell of failed challenges by the Bengals in the second half.
These run calls are terrible
"Wow, fuck you Fox"
Run blocking is non existent
YEAHHH LOWESSS WOOHOOO
Imagine if we could secure a block outside the tackle box...
LETS GO OFFENSE
i really don't know what some of you are watching. there wasn't a single replay that definitively showed his right foot in bounds.
Wow we cannot run the ball for shit lmao
For the love of fuck. GO FORWARD.
I swear fox interrupts game flow more than cbs. So many breaks and side by sides.
Steelers rushing at 1.5 yards a rush
"Well if they‚Äôre not going to run the ball, those quick passes for some yards will work lol"
Big boy Claypool
LETS GO OFFENSE
Good to see Ben still using the pump fake.
Fist down baby
"That pump fake even got me, I really thought he threw it for a second"
EBRON
Good catch
Ebron was a amazing pick up
So did the bot die?
Backyard Ben is the best Ben
Ebron falls to the ground so hard. Haha. No grace
EBRON!
"Vilma, he got the foot down but dropped the ball. How bad are you"
good fuckin catch ebron
What a play Ben and ebron
Ebron has such great communication with Big Ben and just being able to read how a play is going.
Why am I still nervous??
Just a casual one hander
 Ebron. Nice!
LETS GO OFFENSE
Ebron is my favorite offseason pick up
Ebron you magnificent bastard.
"I swear, if this commentator says empty package one more time..."
Jujujujuju
The weekly abandoning of the run game is alarming. We are not going to win in the playoffs if this is our approach.
hell yeah Juju
Love the passes... we run to protect Ben ...
"Why do they speculate so hard about Steelers potential injuries, but they don‚Äôt tell us about Bengal DB being out until the next half?"
A GOOD RUN!
A JAMES CONNER FIRST DOWN
We had a good run?????
Finally a great run by Conner
Easier to run when there's a hole huh.
JuJu is the answer to third down conversions. It took AB a few years to get that role.
JuJu is such a security blanket on 3rd down.
Ben taking over as OC and I‚Äôm so much happier
"Conner is like, -3, 1, -4, 2, 1 -5, 20"
Juju so clutch.
"I know this is killing Randy since he loves to run the Bill Cowher offense, but the run game isn't working. It's ok to abandon it to keep the ball away from Cincy."
LETS GO OFFENSE
THREAD THE FUCKIN NEEDLE
I love Claypool
Ben throwing darts today
Just run the guy straight up the middle
Holy fuck
I reeeeeally like our WR room.
Dam what a catch claypool!!!!!
BIG CANADA BOI
Oh wow see Fichtner That‚Äôs the kind of running lanes you can get when you pass first.
Whew...
MAPLETRONNNNN
STRONGGGGGG MAPLETRONNN
Now james washington just needs one
Gimme more Mapletron!
OH MY GOD. Ben threw a fucking laser bolt right there.
"It's _STILL_ just the third qtr.

C'mon, clock!"
this is how I thought last week was going to go
Where‚Äôd all the complainers go?
CLAYPOOOOOOOOOLLLL!!!!
Ben's pump fake is still one of the best in the game
It ain‚Äôt over until it‚Äôs over.
Losing never heard of her.
Kenny Albert looks like a guy who we're supposed to praise for his determination in recovering from a horrific accident.
So I thought we were worried about Burrow guys lmfao. I told you guys those 2 good throws earlier didn't mean anything.
Another three and out for the Bungles? Whomp whomp.
LETS GO OFFENSE
I do believe this is the first time in 8 games where I haven't been freaking out at this point...
Nvm I dislike Vilma now
[deleted]
Bengals have ZERO pass rush holy shit
Why do they let those plays continue?
Please just I do love Claypool just laughing in that guys face
Saints fans getting a monkey paw finger to curl with Winston in the game now.
Man if Ben can connect on these deep balls we would be such a hassle for defenses
I dont think I've seen a sadder live game thread than the bengals sub. Crying for obvious DPI calls and just all around sad people. Honestly feel bad for them
damn its still the 3rd quarter
Once again our games take SO long
Vince just killed a guy
This Fox graphic makes it look like the Bengals have -7
"Did anyone else hear:

""NO! IT'S NOT FAIR!""

After that last broken up pass?"
Defense is eating today
Time for the Mercy Rule sheesh
You guys think we should take Ben out for the 4th or not up enough?
"Goddamn, we have some talented receivers but their hands are sus as fuck."
Claypool turned the wrong way
Dammit that was close
LETS GO OFFENSE
The LB led with his head all the way...
I swear I haven't seen tomlin once
Can someone smarter than me explain why I haven't been hearing Steven Nelson's name this year?
Probably would have been 6.
Don't throw that Ben
Bruh that ball was gonna roll to the one
just get the 1 yards come on
LETS GO DEFENSE
TJ trying to finally catch up to Derek's safety stat.
Get a safety
Such a long game wow
Jonathan Vilma is fucking annoying. I dont even hate him because he is hating the Steelers. Any clear bias against another team as an announcer is annoying as can be.
"Joe Burrows...welcome to the NFL, today was your baptism"
What kind of throw was that Burrow lmfao
WHAT A FUCKING RETURN
Ray ray is the chosen one
Rayray!!!
"Damnit, I thought we were gonna see it there."
Ray Ray!!!!
I love Ray-Ray!
He's gonna get in there one day this year
Ray Ray's field vision is so fucking good
"Was gonna say McCloud was pissed bc he lost a gem of a punt when the flag was thrown but lol, Bengals gave him another gem"
Rayray is the Leveon Bell of returners.
why is Ben still in the game
LETS GO RAY RAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ray Ray is gonna house one soon enough. He‚Äôs been incredible all year returning
So good they named him twice
"Almost there. If he doesn‚Äôt get a special teams TD at some point this season, it‚Äôll be a travesty. He‚Äôs been awesome"
McCloud is perhaps the best last name to exist
Ray Ray should be an all pro. What an absolute god send this man is
Ray Ray should make the All pro PR team. What a great pickup that was
"Love Conner, but where are the other RB‚Äôs?"
Ray Ray a simple juke then wham afterburners
JuJu punishes everyone
Have my kids juju
Honestly I cant blame Conner when he's constantly hit in the backfield every time
Juju is a touch son of a bitch
11 mins remaining my lord
"Juju is so tough, man just has that spirit"
 Not good for the other guys when the announcer says the game is practice for the Steeler offense
JUJU ü§ô
"When you're so bad, multiple commentators have referred to the game as ""practice"" lol"
Is this the best receiving corp in the game?
MAPLETRON AGAIN
CLAYPOOL AGAIN?!?!?
# MAPLE MOTHER FUCKING TRON!
Mapletron
[deleted]
MAPLETRON
Time to call in the reindeers!!!
"Someone in this thread commented that Ben was going to reach 400 yards and 4 TDs, lol. And we're not even playing from behind."
"I know it's the Bengals, but this pass game can beat almost any team. It's just the run game that will hold them back."
Feels weird to me that it only took Cinci 5 years to go from playoff contenders to bottom feeders in our division
Take notes Joe. Big Ben handing out free lessons
Juju and Ebron lmaooo
Just need an int now
"Jesus, this game is taking forevs"
avery williamson finally getting some snaps
0/11 on 3rd downs? Jeez
Space launch in 5 minutes
That‚Äôs not even a bulky jacket. That‚Äôs just Ben in a T-Shirt
Let's surpass our shit pushing in of the Browns here and hold them to 7 here and get at least one more score
Big shout out to the boys that took Pit at -7 today.
BRING OUT MASON!
0/12 with a sack *chefs kiss*
"Defense is eating lunch right now and making the Bengals pay for it.

Edit: Naturally I make this comment and the D makes me eat my words lol."
Fuck garbage time points
"Uh oh, Bungles getting uppity

Guess Mr's Watt and Dupree need to turn it back on"
Is that what you want bengals. More sacks on burrow
man imagine if they tried to run it on us this game lol it might be a whole other game
"""They're going to try to make a game of it""

Yeah, no."
SPILLANE!!! YES!
"Whoa, didn‚Äôt realize Spillane was a football bloodline."
There‚Äôs the sacks I was looking for
They need to take burrow out. Were teeing off
SPILLANE
Their offense wanted to stay on the field knowing full well what it is we do to outsiders 'round these parts.
T.J Watt seems pissed for some reason... He keeps hitting every Bengals player near him after plays. Hadn't noticed that about him in previous games
Now we get to watch Rudolph
Hopkins is a fucking monster
Looks like Rudolph got to play after all....
Gonna be kickoff for night game soon...
A lot of backups b playing
If we don‚Äôt blow these clowns out
Lotta Roethlisberger passes getting batted at the line this year.
Why does FOX always come up with shows that never make it past the first season?
"I hope that series made y'all realize it isn't Conner's fault the run game is bad. 

It's the O-line. We had a jumbo tight end AND a fullback and they couldn't block. They suck at blocking."
"Some of our ""fans"" like to only comment when the other team scores. Just so they can complain.

But when we do something good. They silent."
IM FUCKING DONE WITH RANDY. LIKE HONESTLY FUCK THIS GUY. THE OUTSIDE RUN ISNT FUCKING WORKING..BEN IS HAVING A CAREER GAME AGAINST THESE BUMS
Third and medium? Go deep!
What was that? Into the arms of JuJu who was already getting tackled?
Kudos to Tomlin for not giving up on Boz after his awful season. He‚Äôs really come through.
EDMUNDS CANT CATCH SHIT BRUH LMFAOOO
Might have been a bit of PI there
"Oh boy another uninspired run play.

And a penalty too."
I really dislike the reliance on little dink and dunk short plays
Conner is painful to watch at times
lmao chase with the savvy veteran move tossing the ball back a few extra yards. I appreciate him taking the swing lol
This play calling is ridiculous but I swear sometimes it looks like James Conner just has no idea what he's doing out there. I love him but he'll bounce it out when he should just run hard forward and vice versa at the worst times.
The secondary came to play today
Good return ray ray
This game may drag on for another 4 hours
Ray Ray is so shifty
"üö®BREAKING NEWSüö® 

JOE HADEN GOT A PBU AND IT WASNT CALLED DPI

I REPEAT

JOE HADEN GOT A PBU AND IT WASNT CALLED DPI"
"Lol I love Ben and has a history of being the toughest QB in the league, but after decades of abuse dude can‚Äôt even give himself up without risking season ending injury"
"I swear to God, this offense is fucking impotent when it comes to closing out a drive."
"Ok webmd boys, how fucked is claypool"
"Wow.

Is this the Bungles home announce team?"
Only rushing 3? Burrow finding open receivers over and over again.
What the hell is Connor doing
I don't know what Conner saw there
What's the big deal about Burrow? Am I missing something?
Conner is cheeks
"Idk why everyone‚Äôs so mad at Conner, he‚Äôs not asking for these plays."
16 rushing yards out of 256 total yards so far. Man our running attack is anemic to say the least. I‚Äôm honestly impressed that we‚Äôre able to pass so well with defenses basically putting everyone in coverage since our running game isn‚Äôt a threat whatsoever.
Why is Watt never getting calls for holding? He‚Äôs always getting held it seems
Burrow fell into a bench
This game feels closer than the score suggests
Ugly but that's how we do. Great first half!
"Have to find out a way to get the run game going, literally anything positive."
"Every time I flush a toilet, I think of where it goes....   Downstream to the Bengals."
Joe ‚ÄúSavy‚Äù Haden
Pity we can't call a decent run play for Connor... but anyone see that pancake block he just did?
lmao what the fuck is up with this announcer? TJ Watt just saved a 15 yard gain? You could say something like that about every fucking play...if he doesn't make that tackle its a 15 yard gain! If he throws that ball accurately that would've been a completed pass!
"Big Ben and over throws, so hot this season."
Fans need this shit. It‚Äôs been a rough few weeks
Mapletron GOTTA be leading OROY candidate
Now the game is looking like it is supposed to and keep the foot on the gas through the end of the game.  Not the usual one foot on the gas and the other on the brake when ahead.  Probably the only lesson to take from Belicheat.
AJ green has had his career wasted
SIT BEN OR RIOT
"Ok, I guess I can stop complementing the special teams group today :/"
Welcome to your future joe
"If Gordon Ramsay was our OC, he would‚Äôve kicked Conner out of the Kitchen already."
Since 2H of that titans game the offense has looked like a bottom 10 offense.
This stuff is exactly why no one takes the Steelers seriously even though they‚Äôre undefeated.
How is it so windy inside a stadium?
The Masked Singer is such garbage. Television can't die soon enough.
"Wanna kill the drive, hand the ball to Connor"
"almost 200 yards for Burrow from playing horseshit zone and prevent. Pressure him, bury him into the turf."
Is Bradshaw drunk or something. He can barely speak
And James Conner just tanked that drive in one play.
"Punt it again!!!


It's free downs!!!"
Terrible playcalling
Fox is using the cartoons as a test for when they air their newest show: NFL anime.
We really find every way to waste an amazing O-line
Offensive playcalling literally the only thing holding them back this year
Our offense needs to take advantage of the short field here
McCloud good
That was a great throw but just a better defensive play by Haden.
McCloud is the shit
"I swear, RayRay is just getting closer and closer to breaking one off."
"Guys, this game isn‚Äôt going to be offensive football that we‚Äôre accustomed to until 3rd/4th quarter. Get comfy and expect some 3 and outs the rest of the first half."
With these winds it‚Äôs likely that our defense will score a td before the offense
Lmao they‚Äôre lucky Ben didnt try to nail anybody. He would‚Äôve killed someone
"Ben shakes hand


DEFCON 5!!!!"
BRO can Vilma shit the fuck up
That‚Äôs Ben‚Äôs first long pass in two years!!
They stopped forcing the run.
"Either catch it or it breaks your ribs asshole!

\- Ben to DJ, probably"
"What‚Äôs the word on Derek? Do they just not fancy him on offense or what? 3rd and 2 should be a power run, not 5 wide."
"We have 1 of those per game on defense


All normal here. It's ok"
Didn‚Äôt they ban dunking on the crossbar?
"That throw was peak Ben, if he can channel that energy combined with the best regular season the Steelers have ever had, I just don‚Äôt think we can be beaten."
"Soooo, they are saying the AFC North is full of good teams.  Except for the Bengals.  Reality must sting."
[deleted]
LMAO he practically handed him the ball and he still dropped it HAHAHAHA
Hilarious to see the Bengals sub crying.
Conner is simply incapable of getting yards
God I hate Fichtner. Run run pass. This offense is clearly not built for running the football. They need to be using the passing game to open up the running lanes but Tomlin and Fichtner refuse to understand that.
"Ok, we *might* win this game."
I‚Äôm happy we have a great lead.... but all I can think of is 19mins of game clock remaining lol
"29-7 is nothing guys, we could blow this lead do not think it‚Äôs over"
"Amazing catch, absolutely immaculate throw"
"A Stress Free Sunday!

outside of the stress of finishing grad work but still."
"If the Bengals have to punt, probably should take Ben out.  

They won‚Äôt though."
Can we put Dobbs in to see how he does pls
Ray Ray has to be top 5 returner in the league right?
Vilma saying Burrow is gonna do a better time next time. Like wtf bro.
TOUCHDOWN CLAYPOOL. GET THE FUCK OFF THE FIELD YOU SCUMS OF THE AFC NORTH.
Get the Boswell Photoshop ready.
What is that celebration that Juju keeps doing after his good receptions?
"There was nuke dropped in Buffalo just now. 

Pray for the mafia."
Burrows was grabbing his knee..shit.
"I'm fine with giving Snell the ball for the rest of this game, but he's not the guy moving forward. He's had his opportunities this season and he's fumbled them away. None of the Steelers backs are going to be great because the offensive line is not good at run blocking. The Steelers need to lean on the passing game if they want to win a championship this season. Throw to set up the run, not the other way around."
I told you guys that Conner ruins the momentum once he touches the ball
"3 and out


Blow it up


Fire Sullivan"
Great gameplan on 3rd down again.
hmm we only scored a field goal...FIRE TOMLIN
Why did we go for 2 in the 1st quarter? Just kick the fucking XP
this game is going really slow compared to all the others. there are games at halftime or about to me and we're still at 10:30 in the second
"in spite of us winning currently, it is infuriating seeing this team with no run game."
"BENCH BEN.

SEND OUT RUDY."
Fuck it put dobbs in .
"In Dallas, how can I watch game?"
Predictions?
[Thoughts?](https://i.imgur.com/sLCDgIm.jpg)
the bungles are pulling CBs off the practice squad... so Ben should be bombing all day. no excuse not to.
Browns are about to win.....
Ok hope so .. only 4 min to go
We‚Äôre winning and that‚Äôs it boys!
HERE WE GO
HERE WE GOO
Would love to see us come out 5 wide Ben hurry up
Game time! Let's get this W
Opening drive touch down incoming?
Windy game I guess we got this do nothing but score touchdowns are on two point conversions
LETS GO BOYS
They‚Äôre sending pressure early
LETS FUCKING GO
Not the greatest drive to start the game.
"Don't worry Rocky, you go when you're ready."
LETS GO
I like it.
+1 Already LFG
"Let's be honest, ben has lost some accuracy. Still love that man tho"
Ben missing practice this week could hurt us
Benny Snell Football
OKAY NOW SCORE A TD
Bungles showing up early.
Typical bungles
"LETS JUST SAY BEN MADE THE PASS TO CLAYPOOL, FUMBLED IT, AND SNELL RECOVERED IT"
Special teams out here today
We should punt more often
Ola
BENNY SNELL FOOTBALL BOYS
It‚Äôs always funny to me how you can tell who is streaming the game (vs. watching on TV) based on the delayed reactions haha
Bengals already turning things over.  Steelers have to capitalize off this and score.
"First game I've only listened to for awhile since I'm not home today.

Worried about Tunch. His speech has noticably changed :("
"Big special teams play, thats a good sign"
Looks windy AF out there
Someone is definitely going to blow a tire on the garbage blowing around Heinz Field right now
Boswell that ends well
Clutch.
Ill take it
I don‚Äôt like seeing berry‚Äôs knees.
Danny Smith chewing up the bengals today
3 and out twice but three point..I‚Äôll take it
That were honestly 2 pretty bad drives. At least we got 3 points out of this.
lmaooooo
Wait what?
"Wait, why?  It hit him?"
sound like a damn hurricane there
"Need TDs, don't want the Bengals hanging around"
LMAO what the fuck
Buttered the ball
"Not gonna be a lot of passing today, I believe"
"What blows harder, the wind in Pittsburgh or the Bungles?"
Nice play 23 :)
Watt being hugged
Is mike Hilton back?
BUNGLES LOL
Was that fucking Cat Stevens in a dodge ram commercial?  Fuck...
Think there‚Äôs going to be a lot of turnovers and botched plays with the wind
Come on Ray-Ray! I feel a runback coming!!
Connor stop bouncing it outside....
There‚Äôs not even 5 minutes off the clock yet? Damn.
Can't even gain a yard on a run even with the hold.
Weird... looks like Ebron was getting held there... nah... Steelers wouldnt be getting fucked on calls in a game.  That never happens.
"That kickoff sequence still seems odd to me. The only reasonable explanations for it not being a safety to me, is that they either ruled he didn't touch the ball or that when he first touched it he was already in the endzone. I'd tend to believe it was the latter, since it looked obvious to me that it was touched. Still would've liked to gamble with a challenge there"
I hope we have a backup plan because Ebron is the worst run blocker out there
Not a fan of these outside runs
Catch it DJ
Been ugly for both squads so far
Geez
We will get it going. Need to key in on the plays on offense
I want to see Ray Ray get a ST touchdown so bad!
Surprised to see Antwon Brooks getting so much playing time.
"Ben, plz don't lol"
I want the other half that Oreo ad where Santa has to kill the guy and the elf to keep his secret secure.
Taking a page from the Ravens there
"I was like...whaaaa.... Benjamin, you no block"
Claypool!
THATS more like it. Gj Conner
I love seeing Ben as a lead blocker but it also scares the hell out of me
That‚Äôs how you use pre-snap motion to open up the run game
"Here we go, JC"
I'm always scared of Conner.
Go Connor!
Now we're moving!
Wind knocked out of him
Let's get a td here please
üòí
Of fucking course he did
Don't do this to me...
Come on... Get the first down... didn't need the endzone shot...
Should we blame this on wind??
It‚Äôs a definite difference between Randy and Canada/Roethlisberger.
Holy fuck if I have to see ‚ÄúELBOW WATCH‚Äù one more time
Bosgod to the rescue.
Damn. Washington was wide open
"'Trying to make something out of nothing.'

Hey I resemble that remark."
"Washington was wide open. Not a bad call against a man blitz, and the mesh worked. Had a touchdown"
Ben is still human. Bonking your elbow hurts no matter who you are. Chill out announcers.
They do this elbow thing every single game.
Praise be
What spiritual bondage does this team have with going deep on 3rd and medium???
We should make an effort to get juju the ball
Hints of Boswells 2016 game against KC
BY GAWD ITS BOZGAWD
I swear the gals have no CB's but the crap weather is gonna not going to let the steelers take advantage
Why are they talking good about Rudolph lol
It would be cool if we didn't call asinine plays on 3rd and short.
Why did the commentators say Bozgod has never missed a kick against the bengals...
He picked the absolute worst place on his entire body to land on there
He's probably lucky he just fell down
Tough game but I think we‚Äôre looking much better than Cinci
Can our offense get us a lead?!
Stupid penalties.
‚ÄúHopefully he completes this first down‚Äù...I don‚Äôt want to be the guy complaining about announcers not being impartial but like wtf?
DJ!!
There we go!!!
Wait is it 3rd quarter already
Keep er going boys
 It‚Äôs smellin like TD already
So 38 year old Ben is a Warrior going for the extra yard.  But landing on his throwing elbow.  Big fella that‚Äôs why they invented the slide so you don‚Äôt have to do that shit to yourself.
Beautiful deep ball by Ben with the wind
Yeah his elbow is going to be just fine
T U D D Y
DJ!!!!! WHAT A PLAY! THERE U GO BABY. I FUCKING SEE YOU 18
"Sheesh, that was perfection by Ben!!!"
"If anybody wants to have a laugh, just visit the Bengals subreddit"
There‚Äôs that farm boy strength there.
LETS GOOO
Now that‚Äôs a drive.
Ez
This receiving corp. üî•
Best drive of the year
PI?
They heard y'all complaining about a long quarter.
Fucking finally.
"Johnson making it look easy. 

That's what I wanted to see from the offense."
Damn that was fast
So hopefully r/nfl calms down after we played a bad game against the Cowboys
Spilling over the lane
SPILLAINE wanted Borrows
Spillane went like three yards over on that lol
A glitch in the robo code
oh my god the Bengals running offense is so bad
What do you guys think. Should we be worried about Joe Burrow or nah?
Another take away baby :)
Burrow did not like what he saw from the defense.
Fox‚Äôs graphic packages are so fucking lame
Ripped that ball outta there
thanks higgy
Sutton a beast
"Friendship ended with Mike Hilton

Friendship started with Cam Sutton."
HELL YES
HAHAHAHA GIMME THAt
STRIP THAT SHIT BOI
Jesus fuck. What are you lot drinkin' on?
LETS FUCK GO D
Man Sutton is playing out of his mind the last few games.
Sutton has stepped up big time with Hilton out.
nice strip
He‚Äôs going he‚Äôs going he‚Äôs zuhhhhhhhhh
Avery Williamson teaching his new team some tricks
I don't get it. We get the ball back and then the offensive line is nowhere to be found.
Bungles gonna bungle
How is it only the first quarter still?!?!?
cartoon ben is jacked
Uh guys you gonna block like one person?
Do we have a FB?
Classic Ben play right there
Stop fucking running powerruns. Yeah o line is not helping but for fuck sake.  Let‚Äôs sell the power run.
Playing against our defense is a great test of your grip strength
Did it get a lot darker or is my stream messed up?
Play calling is ass.
"We so desperately want to throw these behind the LOS passes it's scary, any chance we can do more of those... >2 yard passes instead?"
with how their offense is going shouldn't have let that ball go out the back of the end zone? maybe he saw the way it was spinning or something.
Can someone tell me why so many passes are Bering batted down.
damn I‚Äôm working so I‚Äôm not able to watch the game but I see the score on ESPN and this shit wildin
"'We met over a century ago.'

Fuck I know I look awful for my age but I'm not that old."
Burrow had a pick6 this year yet?
Inconsistent
Damn they left him wide open
Hold 'em for three boys.
Damn he got sandwiched.
We use our base defense too much when other teams have 3 or 4 guys out wide
Hold em off boys
Lame.
Damn.
:(
What is the sack streak at?
LET‚ÄôS GO OFFENSE.
The Bengals special teams are actually pretty good
 Juju bro
The ball is going to be thrown hard to beat the wind. Our receivers need to know that and catch the god damn ball.
Empty set Ben moving the ball. Same stuff different week
Didn't drop that!
Drops are killing us
Yay claypool
WHAT A CATCH
Made up for that drop jujuuuuu
56 celebrating as if he actually did something.
That was innocent.
Why does Diontae keep trying to juke?
""" there we go ""

listen to Vilma. jesus christ"
"Damn, that could've been bad."
"Personal foul, roughing the Ben."
"First down by interference.

OK by me."
Chsse is mad cuz that dude cost him a td
Typical cowardly Bungle shit from Hubbard
Carson Palmer would die from that
Thinking about just muting the tv at this point
That was shades of Kimo von Oelhoffsen
You cannot defend him
"Fuck Sam Hubbard, punk ass"
Dpi vs Claypool
Claypool draws flags like a maniac
Claypool sold that like a grizzled veteran
"I mean I'd hug Chase Claypool too, though the Bengals should wait until after the game or even the play itself"
Wth was that
AUTOMATIC FIRST DOWN
That was a fucking missle
Right through his hands
THATS WHAT BEN FUCJING DOES
JUJU!!! HOW I LOVE U
JUJU TD !
Bungles gonna bungle
Classic Ben
Bengals game planned for that Claypool sweep
Yes!!!
Well that was ugly as fuck.
Big Benjamin
Dude did you steal my rooster!!!!
Damn that would have been sick if he could have caught that
Can we stop with these runs?
JUJUUUUUUU
JUJU!
Ju Ju!
Juju!
Offense looking MUCH better now
Ok let‚Äôs get a stop defense!
"TRY AND DMCA CLAIM THAT ONE, TWITCH"
"Fuck, I lost signal smh. Saw on Twitter that juju got a td tho"
"Beautiful pass, beautiful catch. Let‚Äôs go JuJu."
üòé
Let's good! Great play by Ben. That was huge.
Glad to see Boz and the kicking team get it back together even in tough weather.
Big Ben let‚Äôs go!!!
Let‚Äôs keep that sack streak alive.
"Aww yiss, nice to be up 7 - JuJu"
Anyone else see that dude in the stands give away the td ball?
So is Higgins just going to win the matchup all day like whatshisname did for the Eagles?
Yikes. We‚Äôre in trouble if Burrow has these open receivers all day
oh that was juju‚Äôs momma?
Good holding call. I like that.
FINALLY A SACK
There's Watt!!
These announcers polishing off the tip of Burrow and the Bungles.
The streak continues.
"Has Burrow held the ball for longer than 3 seconds yet this game?

&#x200B;

Nevermind... just over 4 seconds there and sacked"
Hells yeah
EAT THAT DIRT
With how many flags the Bengals have been drawing they might want to be careful with what they are wishing for in hoping to see a flag come out.
There‚Äôs that sack!!!
Sack!
I mean we can play defense but we can‚Äôt really run for shit more times than not so that‚Äôs not exactly true
There it is!!!
"lol, they show Myles instead of Baker"
What is the streak at now?
Finally thank you TJ
ok time to get some points before half.
Hehehe TJ ......
It would be great if we could score a touchdown here
Anyone know what the strap hanging off of Bud is?
Now we're cooking!
Let‚Äôs score now boysssssss
Way to hold on to it ebron.
So many drops today...
Ravens and Browns are so mad we stay undefeated
"Fuck that wind, we throwing that thang today"
I missed seeing him take intermediate throws
That tip scared me. I'm scared of the tip.
DJ didn‚Äôt even put two hands up there...
"They'll keep sleeping on us until we're in the Super Bowl, I guess"
Ebrontosaurus
"When Ben and his receivers are in sync, running games are optional."
Let's go EBRON
Great run and pass
Shotgun? Shotgun anybody?
"Jesus Christ, WTF was that play?"
"Great play by DJ, but I don‚Äôt know what that DB was thinking with that lack of effort to force him out of bounds"
Why call the run if no one can block today?
bruh fuck a run game. just let Ben sling it for 60 minutes.
Johnson is unfuckingreal today
Great to see the offense is clicking early
DJ IS GETTING BUSYYYYYYYYYY
DJ is coated in oil
"I‚Äôm liking the offense, but these outside runs are not working. Pls stop"
What‚Äôs going on with all these outside runs
Every fucking time jeez
Are we technically an Air Raid team this year?
If we stopped running Connor to the outside we‚Äôd have a much better run game
We cannot run the ball
Ben looks pissed about that call
Literally our dudes are pass blockinn there run up the middle let Conner get 1 or 2 instead of -5
"Even if that‚Äôs the play call, how dense is Conner to run backwards 10 yards on three handoffs now? Just get back to the line of scrimmage if the blockers are pushed that far back. Obviously you‚Äôre not getting anywhere going that way"
"With how slow this game is, I‚Äôll be surprised if the game is over before SNF starts"
Of course I have conner starting against DJ in fantasy this week
For fucks sake just run at them
Conner enjoys going backward.
Lol Conner runs outside for -yards. I have seen this one before
"This might be a stupid question, but could Conner have thrown the ball forward out of bounds there? Like when a quarterback scrambles out of pocket they can throw it away out of bounds."
Should the pregnant lady being coming over and hanging out with friends during a global pandemic?
I'm glad Juju has been putting up numbers the last few weeks
"I see everyone bashing Conner, and he's part of it sure, but the play calling is just bad. The shotgun run game and too many pulling linemen are making it nearly impossible to get a clean hole."
All hail Bosgod
and then we have the give up short pass on 3rd and 15 lol oof
Thank you BozedGod
Some games are already almost to the 4th quarter.. and here were are still 1-2 drives from half lol
Not a Pittsburgh fan but a Conner owner in fantasy. He did really well now he's giving me duds the last two weeks. What's going on?
Ben has more passing yards right now than in 5 other games this season
Edmonds didn‚Äôt do anything there
Prevent defense ... smh
Not a DB on this roster that can cover Higgins
WATT!!!
It is amazing how much a difference Mike Hilton makes in this secondary.
Terrell Edmonds doesn‚Äôt miss tackles
WHAT THE FUCK DEFENSE ?????
"I mean I get that they are trying to call less holds, but how do you miss something so blatant?"
What a beast
Look at mondeux and then look at TJ. You cannot tell they are both professional athletes.
Bro they held Watt right there.
TJ WATTTTTTT
TJ!!!!!
Lol bungles
Bend dont break!
This half is never going to end
"Jesus, Haden got fucking trucked lol"
Our defense keeps hitting each other
It‚Äôs lucky that was overthrown
Anyone notice Bud‚Äôs tail
Great stop
Just woke up from my nap falling asleep in the first quarter what‚Äôd I miss
The defense has Burrow's number.
"happy feet, can't commit."
The defense is good at stopping the run
I feel like there really is no pockets for running
Man Conner
I really wish we would stop with these runs.
"Not gonna lie, I'm excited watching Miami find some rythem. Hope that team does well. They deserve it"
how are we supposed to beat good teams if we can‚Äôt run and can‚Äôt convert
I see we started the conservative approach already
Juju looks great today while Conner not so much...wonder if either of them are kept around after this season.
Our running game brings nothing to the table.
Where would you guys rank Haden in terms of best FA signings all time by Pittsburgh? #2 behind farrior? Or #1 perhaps?
"Run run pass 

Why the fuck do they go out of their way to stop doing what works??"
BOOOOOM
 BERRY GOOOD
WHAT A PUNT
Maybe we are tanking our offense to try and get TJ more sacks?
Jordan Berry is back!!
Holy fuck berry boomed that shit
Do we have another back today?  Like to see em
"Jesus what a tackle on the punt returner, timed to perfection"
Who is this punter? Lol
WHAT A FUCKING PLAY
Great punt and coverage
Seems like he didn‚Äôt have full control of the ball and had to adjust but we‚Äôll see
Looks like a catch to me
That‚Äôs a catch.
No catch
Didn't maintain control? Anyone know if thats a thing anymore?
Did he bobble the ball?
BALL MOVED. INCOMPLETE
Catch
One more TD and we are good to go.
Probably a catch
Can go either way.
The ball was still moving the entire time.
Iffy. Not enough to overturn. On with the punt
Ball is loose
It's gonna be a catch from me dawg
Anyone been keeping an eye on Antoine Brooks? How's he played so far
The call is incomplete. There‚Äôs not enough evidence to overturn it.
Incomplete
The ball came out?
"That‚Äôs a coin flip call. I could see it going either way. Although if you are unsure, the standard is to defer to the ruling on the field"
Hold on to the ball Ray Ray got lucky there
OH SHIT....
Bengals down a timeout
That‚Äôs a bad call that benefits us. My favorite
"Almost a fumble, still not missing Switzer."
Our run game just isn't there at all
They called him down already dumbass
That definitely looked like a fumble to me. Was it actually the Steelers that recovered?
It's like every fifth play a  jet sweep at this point
WaOew
Ah let's go to another jet sweep when the last 2 didn't work
Imagine running the exact same sweep expecting different results
Bengals don't even have a challenge anyways.
I don't recall us ever having a running game this bad.
Stop running!
"If it‚Äôs not working at first, just keep doing it until it works"
damn it. The run game is just not on today.
Claypoooooool
LETS GO OFFENSE
Please stop running sweeps 10 times a game. Just please stop
Overusing the WR run. Claypool is a WR.
our running game got snapped out of existence like 4 weeks ago....like it don't exist anymore
i like how he sat on the bench lol
"‚ÄúThe Steelers have tried everything possible to get the run game going‚Äù ummmm no they haven‚Äôt? Every run has been to the left side where Villanueva has been getting owned all game.

Run to the right"
Can‚Äôt run the 2 yards
"Fuck the run game. It's not working. We either keep passing the ball, or give Cincy more possessions and time to try and get back into it."
LETS GO OFFENSE
Its almost scary how bad our rush D was without Alualu... now how bad our rushing offense is with Vance out
"Vilma really needs to look at our pass success rate and run success rate before saying we must run the football. I agree it has to be better, but it‚Äôs not necessary if something else is working better"
This announce doesn't know anything about our team  lol
Haha Ben faked the Camera man with that Pump
I love watching Ben move backwards
"Not to continue shutting on the run game, but Conners best play of the game is a 6 yard reception. God damn"
" 4 plays of 4 WR, 1 TE, empty. 4-4 for 98 yds, TD"
Soo y‚Äôall explained to me how ass our O-line is.. so who do y‚Äôall see staying on this line next year ? Cuz all I see is Pouncey (aging hard as well) and DD
"Chase Claypool is having a ton of fun playing football, and you love to see it"
Ben threw him open
I could‚Äôve sworn CC got both feet down
Ebron is a freak
4th read there... 5th read?  That play was definitely never meant to go to Ebron
EBRON FIRST DOWN BABY
ebron only makes spectacular catches it feels like lmao
THANK YOU EBRON
Ben pumping the ball always gets me a lil wet
if only they could rush for 2 but they are averaging 1.5
That was a fantastic fucking catch.
the O line has put ALL....ALL of their energy into pass blocking...like they monstard themselves
Claypool was so open there
"Wow, total yards are that close?!"
"ebron did a  great job of getting his legs up and away from that tackle, too many injuries getting pinned by defenders"
LETS GO OFFENSE
Go to JUJU
jujujujujujuju
Large wounded quail
Finally
There u go conner
Take that Connor haters.
Did I just see a running play go for positive yardage AND a first down?!
Juju keeping the chains moving!!
Oh shit! A positive run!
Laser!
yeeeeeee
Mapletron strikes again!!!
That‚Äôs threading the needle there.
MAPLETRON TD
Wtf is this camera work
This is the game we needed.
Love it
"Once again, that Ben pump fake is still elite."
Fucking laser beam
"My FF team thanks you, Chase"
I‚Äôm sensing a takeaway coming up to seal the deal.
Easy win baby I‚Äôm not even gonna watch the fourth quarter
Ben finding his rhythm is so fun to see. Love it.
Mapletron!!!
Ben baby why you try to kill me this way
I'm starting to think this one might not come down to the last drive!
Name a better duo: the Steelers and beating the Bungles
üá®üá¶üá®üá¶üá®üá¶üá®üá¶
honestly thought Ben was going to hit Conner over the middle on that td play
This game is awesome!! This gaaaammme is awwweeesooommmeeeee....YEAH!!!
I think we‚Äôre starting to rattle Burrow
What happened to AJ Green? Injuries?
"Roll, safeties. roll!!"
LETS GO OFFENSE
How many yards is Ben at?
Automatic first down
Bet Bengals fans say that wasn‚Äôt PI
"The pass blocking is still pretty good, but I think the difference between the Mike Munchak unit and the Shaun Sarrett unit is the run blocking."
LETS GO OFFENSE
Dionate almost got killed there
B I N C E.
LETS GO DEFENSE
Bince.
Bince go boom
What's the Bus up to these days? Maybe he can come in just pound the rock in these games & at least pick up 3 yards a carry
Holy fuck
Don‚Äôt risk Ben anymore. Trash time is coming. Need to find a way to run though
"Gotdamn, Vince!!!"
BINCE!!
Vince laying the wood.
Bince that guy has a family!!
Damn Bince chill lol
What a hit jesus.
Williams about knocked the soul out of that guy.
Vince Violence
vince Williams followed by Where da hood at lmao love it
VINCE!!!
HIT STICK!
These Bengals are really bad eh?
gotta love big ben's six pack in that drawing lol
0-10 on 3rd
Burrow looks like he's not wanting to put that much weight on his right ankle. When getting helped up he kept it extended like he was avoiding using it getting up. He might be hurt.
Watch for a fake here.
Ben with his Brian Shaw forearms in thee graphic.
Alejandro is so sunburnt today lol
This has to be last series for starters right?
LETS GO OFFENSE
"3rd and 1, think we‚Äôll try to run for a first down?"
LETS GO OFFENSE
Berry having a career day
1st and goal lol
At least our Special Teams are doing a lot better this week.
I don't think Pittsburgh is the orange team ref
Berry has been on point today. Special teams really bringing it today.
this game is SUUUPER slow. I'm happy about it personally but it's crazy it's this late with a whole quarter left
Bud needs some sack love today.
I know this isn't about the Steelers guys but did the announcers say that Drew Brees got hurt bad?
JUST a tad short.
Safety would be quirky
Great stop there
9 and fucking oh baby!
It's weird to hear Vilma keep calling the Steelers a good running team.
"You know I want to see.

I want juju on his twitch to go to Burfict's house and tackle him when he opens the door..."
"Burrow is definitely hurt, his throwing mechanics look fucked and he doesn't have the power or accuracy he did earlier cause he can't put his full weight on his right ankle."
Not the first game Zac Taylor has conceded this year
Man this game has been unbelievably slow with these penalties
Haha nice one
Almost took it the house. He will break one some day
LMFAOOOO FUCK RAY RAY. I FUCKING LOVE YOU
MCCLOUD!
Ray Ray has been such a difference maker this year.
I love Ray Ray. He‚Äôll get one before the season is over
GOD HES FAST
Ben still here?
Damn. Ray Ray has been so close to busting one multiple times this season. I hope he gets that TD at some point.
"They couldn't let McCloud finally return one for a touchdown? 

So fucking close!!!"
McCloud is a problem for special teams.
"Damn punter, mcloud was so close to breaking that"
"Steelers now entering the Heinz Red Zone!

Thank you, Ray Ray"
big play ray ray
Just give Ben some rest. No I‚Äôm not just saying that because I picked the under
Ray Ray is so close to housing one this season. It's coming.
RAY RAY STRIKES AGAIN!
Ben doesn't want to come out it seems
LETS GO OFFENSE
Shades of Hines Ward there
Lmao we really can't run the ball at all
FIRST DOWN JUJU
Juju you fucking madlad
Finally a graphic without those horrible drawings
LOL THE BUNGALS
Lets bench some guys I guess!
CHASE x2
9 touchdowns in 9 games what a tank
Cryingbengalslady.jpeg
6 of the 9
We sweep more often than a maid
The sweep worked .... once this game.
MAPLETRON X2
It‚Äôs easy let‚Äôs go boys
This soon to be win is so much better with all the trash Bengals fans were talking a few hours ago.
Claypool is a fucking magnet to the endzone
Let's gooo Claypoooool
WOW! An easy win!!!! WOO HOO! Let‚Äôs enjoy the rest of the game!!!!!
I swear these pants fit when I put them on this morning
Anyone else ready to see Rudolph for the rest of the game?  And you think you hate Randy's  run calls so far this game... just wait till that is the majority for the 4th quarter now.
"Okay, now we can start thinking about subs."
Game over! Let's call it a day and move on.
we should just put an O-liner at rb and pass every down
"Entered the game as 7 point favorites. I get the questions with who would be available due to COVID, and the shaky performance the past few games. But how disrespectful lol"
"Yeah Bengals, go all out the last 10 minutes of the game, only High IQ plays from Cincinnati..."
Williamson sighting
Please rest all starters
Ok now... let‚Äôs pray for no injuries!!!!
Mason warming up.
ANOTHER SACK
Haden playing a young mans game today. Love to see it.
Lol
More sacks more sacks!
What are we at 3?
"that should be a full sack for bud I think
 also yikes lol"
You should expect anything...
Ben needs to go out and run through them for that
LMAO
All that effort just to kick a FG. Yikes
Spillane heard Nance and Villa lolol
Has Avery Williamson played at all?  I don‚Äôt recall seeing him at all the last two games.
its gonna be Mason time here
Damnnnn that DHop catch was crazy lol
Human victory cigar.
9-0!!!!!!
Here we go Steelers here we go!!!!!!
bEn iS wAsHeD uP
"&#x200B;

Woot Woot.

&#x200B;

Steelers 9-0"
pounceys been blowing snaps again lately and it's upsetting.
"Conner looking for contact, he could‚Äôve got 2-3 more yards if he went more upfield instead of running toward the defender lmao"
Thanks Conner
James Conner honestly isn't very good. I hope we get rid of him this offseason
Fichtner is a genius. run run pass punt. beautiful
WHY GO FOR 2 OMFG
"WE DEY

edit: First comment! Noice!"
Ben cannot complete a deep-ball this season
The only thing I hate more than chucking the ball deep on third and manageable are teams that line in the shotgun on 3rd and short.
Terrible playcalling
"Disappointing outcome, but man what a hold, great job by Berry."
[deleted]
LMAO
Well now we have to fucking chuck it on this series
ebron kinda being not the guy so far
I know it's not conners fault but this is just agonizing to the eyes. lmao
Getting tires of diante johnson dropping balls
Apparently Roethlisberger shouldn't have been removed from the throwvid-19 list.
[deleted]
Acura: Compared to the wild west our cars are fast.
It's crazy how bad our run blocking has become
Bit ballsy to decline it but we‚Äôll see
Alright Ben... unleash the beast
Some more running woes... offensive line getting bullied.
Just when I was gonna complain about Conner
Wind must have affected the shot gun snap
Why do they make Ben‚Äôs elbow a thing every week? He‚Äôs old
This is guy is talking like Ben is already out of the game
Seems like edmunds dropped enough picks to finally put on a pair of gloves
I was talking shit about DJ on the last possession. As you can see there's good reason I'm not a NFL GM or coach
WTF Spillane. Literally no one was moving.
This run offense is a joke so far against one of the worst running defense in the league. Looks like they are playing together for the first time ever. Poor.
Is claypool good?
Connor gives me heartburn.
hold em to 3 fuckboys
This is what happens when your offense can‚Äôt score touchdowns
Jesus christ defense. Plz no more blown coverage
I thought dunking the football on the crossbar was a penalty now?
What the fuck happened to our defense over the last four weeks
[deleted]
No pass rush is just gonna further expose this secondary
Please catch the ball.
Alright that‚Äôs enough drops for the day guys. Catch the ball and take it to the fucking house lol
"FFS, catch the ball!"
"Yo if we don't score here, more heart attack football"
Oh shit! We converted a 3rd down
Vilma should be fired. Just said ‚ÄúBen never has balls batted down‚Äù and he‚Äôs had like three this game already
How‚Äôs the game going? Power is out here for hours
Is the chat happy now?
Fire Keith butler
Conner seems to really overcomplicate things for himself
My heart can't keep stopping like this. It can't be good for my health.
3rd and long can I get uhhhhhhhh wr screen???!
"What a way to kill a drive.

How does Tomlin not sit down with Fichtner and get this play calling sorted out?"
So glad we traded for Avery Williamson to not play him
Lol that Karate Kid guy was totally checked out for that commercial
Dam. What a catch
Wtf are y‚Äôall watching?!?! Did y‚Äôall not see the ball move a shit ton when he hit the ground? Also looked like the ball touched the ground also
ROUGHING THE FUCKING PASSER MAN!!! CALL IT REFS
Hey I think I'm hearing Abe Lincoln speak... because we're up by FOUR SCORE BITCHES
Why do I still feel nervous?
Sip a beer every time these announcers say covid...
"Claypool has covered how many deep balls so far this year

1"
Old man needs a nap. He deserves it. #LetBenSleep
Jesus christ. Fell for a fake.
Watt hasn't been on the field. Anyone know anything?
Definitely did not see that coming. That‚Äôs a bummer
Make a game of it? Is Vilma on crack?
at least the bengals are putting on a comedic performance
We broke Burrow.
"Snell showed more heart in that last run than Conner has all day, tbh."
9 AND OOOOOOOOOOOO
Run game is not working with Conner. Let snell run one or McFarland. At least mix it up because it‚Äôs predictable
Doesn‚Äôt feel like we had a dominant first half
this game feels like an autism simulator where the world moves in slow motion
"Any hate on Connor shows you have a bad football mind.  Steelers have been weak on zone blocking for years, and Connor has never been a strong outside runner.  This is play designing at our own weakpoints and its embarrassing."
Why are we so bad in the first quarter?
Our offense is bad
Tomlin playing 4D chess by declining the penalty and letting Burrow's accuracy stat take a hit! /s
2020 Pittsburgh Steelers and settling for a field goal: name a more iconic duo.
"His whole career, I‚Äôve seen Diontae Johnson as WR2/WR3 similar to Markus Wheaton or Darrius Heyward Bey. It‚Äôs time to start realizing that Diontae Johnson is more than that. He‚Äôs a better Martavis Bryant."
If we struggle this game ima be really concerned about this team
This defense is a bit overrated. They do shit like that instead of keeping their feet on the gas.
only the steelers would allow the bengals a season long 90 yd drive
People are freaking out because they're \*checks notes\* up 5 on the Bengals with 10 minutes left in the second quarter.
Conner stinky poo poo
Maybe Conner is just average
Tf is up with James Connor
Great half and our offense even had 5 bad drives.
I‚Äôd put in Rudolph next series.
There‚Äôs the berry we know and love
"9-0 is nice, but imagine if we had a scrappy gym rat lunch pail working class Steeler FOOTBALL FULLBACK head coach."
"Watching the replay, they could've called a PI on Haden"
Steelers football üòç
Did we really just give up a fake punt? That‚Äôs it. Fire everybody. Don‚Äôt know how much longer I have to say it. Do we even care about winning? Do we even care about our season? I‚Äôm really starting to consider rooting for a new team that doesn‚Äôt allow things like that to happen. Ridiculous. I hope that I can find a new team to root for that is actually good.
LETS GO BABY
He was wide open. Another miss of the deep ball by Ben smh.
Way to convert a fourth down.
3rd and 5?  We need at least 30.
Some of y'all already need to chill
Just ordered some WingStop...it's gonna be a good day
That was hilarious
"Who wants to bet we keep taking deep shots, despite Ben's accuracy issues this year AND the wind."
Offense is an absolute mess so far. Why am I not surprised?
Drop by Johnson.
we should get jamaal williams next year
Johnson needs to stop trying to do too much and just run straight
Diontae has the most stone hands on this team lol
DJ‚Äôs sixth drop of the year
Ok another 3 and out. Nice. Now offense fucking score a touchdown man
Alright offense. We have great field position here. Score a TD
Good D
Gonna need the D to show up all game this week
Wind is no joke either.  Just saw garbage cans fly through the alley behind my place.
Conner just doesn't have that break away speed man..
Ben is rusty. Hopefully warms up a bit
We NeEd To WoRrY AbOuT BeN's ElBow
Can we just take the points early in the game? Why go for 2 in the 1st q????
Diontae is so good
almost time to see how many points the Steelers will almost let the Bungholes score in the second half and make it another close one.
"I remember last week someone was like ""Why can't we strip the ball like that?!"" And I said we're really good at it."
Offensive line and Conner both not good
Currently me wondering why we cant get efficient yards against a team thats trash against the run
Can Big Ben please get the ball over the defensive line
Have we had a sack yet today?
Terrible coaching. Tee Higgins is Burrows‚Äô guy. Unreal
Dang juju has a drop now.
juju's first drop of the season  I think and it's a big one
"Jesus FUCK Fichtner, why?!"
Ju-FUCKIN-Ju
"can‚Äôt watch the game, is burrow carving us up?"
Conner ain‚Äôt it. We need a running back
Conner ain't it. With any luck the steelers will cut ties with him after this season and use one of the first 3 picks next year on a running back.
Great play call
"The killer Bs of today, Boswell and Berry."
Yo happy we‚Äôre winning and all but anyone else kind of wish we‚Äôd get more TDs from these possessions
"Watching James Conner run is like watching someone trying to squeeze water out of a rock. 

I still don't understand his insistence on trying to run everyone over like he's Christian Okoye, not to mention that his entire philosophy around stretch plays consists of trying to run circles around the d-line until there's no room left for a 1yd gain."
Can we see another of our well paid running backs?
"""Alright guys, how should we go about neutering the offense and keeping this game close? Conner runs until we're forced to throw on 3rd and long? I know it's stupid, but it's our best option for accomplishing fuck all without literally kneeling every play! Whatever, we're doing it."""
The ball moved a lot at the end
We have been getting some good calls this year
"How will the Steelers win against good defenses that can shutdown juju and claypool? Oh idk throw to ebron, dj, or james washington."
Connor ran forward holy shit. Xbox record that
I say we sit Ben until they get back within two scores
"Bring in Andy Dalton, Burrow blows"
Ben put too much on em
That‚Äôs that good D
">The left hip still bothering Claypool. He was slow to the sideline after that last deep ball.

I think they are good...push Wash in the game now"
My heart dropped. . .
That was too close
"Let it roll to the 1? Nah, pick it up at the 4."
"God I hate fox announcers (except romo)

Edit- romo is cbs. So yes. I hate fox announcers."
SACKSBURGH
I think spillane is just happy he got off a block for once lol
Sign Fichtner to a 5 year extension
If we struggle with the Bungles I‚Äôm going to be pissed
Just dogshit play calling.
Yea jet fighter pilot in today's 'wars' ain't super hero material.

"every motion is a run

how about sometime you motion and pass"
Score should be like 30-0 right now.
Put in Anthony McFarland or Benny Snell in
Imma say it. I like hearing Vilma and Albert on air. Maybe it's just a change of pace but it's like I actually listen to what they have to say.
Welcome to the AFC North bitch
Well gg guys! FTS! But 2 of my bandmates are from pittsburg and you guys are alllright folk
I just can't believe how many of you here don't understand that we HAVE to run the ball sometime to keep the defense honest. It't just that O-line is shit and Conner is even worse. I'm guessing he's done after this year
[deleted]
"our undying loyalty to James Conner will cost us some games they shouldn't, start developing Anthony Mcfarland as fast as you can. His speed and explosiveness adds another threat to this offense.

His only major flaw is he isn't very big but there have been runs where if we coach him up he would've had huge runs that Conner simply couldn't make."
How do y'all think Ben is gonna play today?
Got my cardiologist on standby!
Hopefully it‚Äôs all TDs and no field goals today with that wind...
Laces out Dan.
Pistol formation? I think that‚Äôs the first we‚Äôve seen them use that all year
can anyone pm link?
Claypool was so open there man...
Ayeee lets gooo
LETS GOOOO
Lol
"We should do that more often, great way to move down the field"
How did I know we‚Äôd go deep so unnecessarily
LOL Bungles gonna Bungle
AYYY
Ola!!!
LAID THE WOOD
James Harrison still got it!
Berry is going to get fined for his socks for sure‚Ä¶
Wtf was that pass
Nice
Fumble!!!! Let's go!
Calculated.
BALLLLL
YESSIRRR
LETS GOOOOOO
OH YEAH
STEEELERS BALLLLLLL
Benny Shell football
North south James.
Hey field progress is what I'll take.
Wtf happened?
Why did Connor cut back so far after the hand off?
God our offense is so bad man
Butt
Holy shit that ball just kept rolling
Lol
Bungles showing up big time today.
if that happens on a punt isn't it a safety?
This wind is insane
God this wind is going to make this game all running today huh
Bungles gonna bungle
So windy
[deleted]
man why do we start slowing that a maple syrup pour in the middle of the winter in Alaska....yesterday I predicted Burrow will beat our secondary up. hope I am wrong
Lawson was holding on to Ebron.
Too windy mane
I can only see that man as Arwin from the suite life
"Alright, time to cash in on good field position"
so manyyyy commercials
BLAZIN BEN!
North south baby.
You too can score with Heinz thick and rich ketchup from your local Giant Eagle
Middle is open why is he throwing that ball
Wtf man. This is just bad play calling.
I am sorry but anything over 10 yards for Ben is basically moot at this point.
"Even without the injury though, landing on your elbow hurts"
Baker needs to do more commercials
These kicks are funny
There you go D
"We need some offense, our d isn't gonna be able to shut them down like this all day."
There we go Benny
"Yes, please."
Yes
FINALLY
"Wake the offense up, wake them up inside. Save me from this boring offensive gameplan.

And Johnson comes in big."
And suddenly we're a good team again
everybody tryin to jinx us by talking about our record.
Damn. That deep pass felt like it was never going to drop
A deep ball?!! What is that
Let‚Äôs go man this game will be a blowout
Ok fine. Lock onto DJ
What a play by Worshington
Great Catch!!
DIONTAEEEEEEE
Finally
Boom suckah!
HELL YEAH
Now that was a great drive.
That sequence of plays seemed too easy
Finally a connection on a deep ball and a follow-up TD.  Time to school this rook and show him how it's done.
Here we go Steelers!!
Well that was a mistake
 Why not just go for the xp lol
I wonder how Burrow will be when he‚Äôs going in the direction of the wind
Lol
"Anyone else notice it was Josh Dobbs asking questions and working with Ben there?

I know its a quick glimpse with little other information."
Can someone explain to me why Mondeaux is on the kick return unit?
He slipped oof
"Anyone have a link to watch the game?
I have a subscription for CBS sports, NFL, ESPN, and Fubo.. none of them are letting me watch the game."
The penalty is. PShhhhhhhffffffshhhhsnd
don‚Äôt you dare scrap with 97
Won't shut the fuck up about the lack of a Bengals first down until they get a first down.
HAIL
Is it just me or do our games always feel so much longer than other teams?
I missed it. What happened to Claypool?
this defense came to play
LETS GOOOFIIOIIIIIISKAWKISAKNSJDWJN
MY BALL BITCH
That was a long ass first quarter
That was fucking beautiful. Another.
Let's goooooo
They didn't earn the name Bungles by accident.
Fumble! Steelers recover
Fuck yeah!
The Bengals are shit.
Definitley don't recover the ball the run towards the bengals goal. You'll end up on Come On Man
Abused
CAM!!!
LETS FUCKING GO!
The old Cincinnati Dropsies
This defense is going to win is a super bowl
Hell yah Sutton! Earning that playtime with big plays after big play.
Can we just run some power right at them?
Beautiful cross body throw from Ben there
Anyone have a picture of Ripped Roethlisberger the broadcast is using?
"Ben just pulled the entire defense with him, that was great. He knew he was going to Washington the whole time."
Why didn‚Äôt we just do a 3 yard out with Johnson that play? It was wide open
Steelers are mucking the game up... and I love it!
I hate going 5 wide there and giving away that it‚Äôs a pass on 3rd and 2.  Would have preferred a fake end around or a shovel pass or something.
"I love Perine. He's the cousin of the one on the Niners.

That's my QB."
Nice defense
We‚Äôre winning the game but it feels like we‚Äôre losing the battle in the trenches.
Jesus
Burnt toast
Rushing three is not working
Can someone explain how that was not our ball? The fumble
"Maybe that will wake up the offense. We need to score and then get a couple sacks before half. 
We need to dominate and then not let up."
Well that‚Äôs the most arbitrary bullshit I‚Äôve ever heard
Let‚Äôs get a third down conversion.
Let‚Äôs go!
Finally converted as third down
Oof if that was any lower that could‚Äôve been a tuddy
[deleted]
Johnson is by far the worst player I‚Äôve seen once he catches the ball. He never knows what to do with it lol
They going after Ben‚Äôs knees? Same old dirty bengals.
Steelers now entering the Heinz Red Zone
Imagine the stats Claypool would have without defensive pass interference
"I hate that rule fr, it‚Äôs so weak"
I saw the season flash before my eyes on that one
Can‚Äôt be touching Ben like that
"Flag on the play, gotta hold that guy cause he'll burn you."
Great route there
Claypool loves shit talking üòÇ
They‚Äôve seen that end around a few too many times on film
Ya love to hear it
"Goddammit, come on."
Ben's a little shifty in the pocket
Finally
Disgusting
What a shocker
Winners keep winning
Big drive.
The Bengals came off a bye week but they look really unprepared for some reason
Can‚Äôt wait until we end the sack streak against the Bengals of all teams
3rd and long.  My butthole is clenched.
And the streak continues
Finally
get a body on burrow......he  needs to get smacked around a bit back there
Get to burrow
Sack streak In tact boys!
DEFENSE!!!!!!
The disrespect to Baker lmao
Kings of the North!!!!!!!!!!
What a catch. God damned.
Damnit Ben. Receivers are getting open every play.
BEN IN BEN MODE
"It's only the 2nd quarter?

Crap. Guess it's because it's dark, now."
I haven't seen anyone hit in stride like that in a long time
"Can we get a run in right here lol, switch it up"
Did we score? I can only find the game on fox but I don‚Äôt have that üòî
How many drops have we had today
We have to many AWESOME WRs to try and double the best
Ebron was moving there. Lol
D  ... ONtae!!!
Ben is cooking now
Oh my God let this offense look like this every minute of every game
YES JOHNSON RAN STRAIGHT
"Well, my earlier prediction for a low passing yard game is going up in smoke. Fine with me!"
Starting to think they need to put Snell in for Connor
"Might as well keep passing, Ben‚Äôs already on pace for over 500 yards"
Run snell up the middle I don‚Äôt care just stop using Connor
Trying to get Conner going disrupts the flow of the offense.
Can‚Äôt be the o line with half the pedigree and minus an amazing coach letting defenders push them back 4 yards. Yeah Conner sucks cut him at halftime.
We had a jet sweep work once and well maybe that's it for that
Looked way more like a pick from the first view
There u go boz
What a wasted possession: going back to an outside run play when it hasn‚Äôt been working ALL game. Wow
 Couldn‚Äôt we have had Jessie bates? Dude is nice
3rd and 15 throw it to the line. Nice
"Hell yeah, now we're three scores up!"
3rd&15? Throw it 8 yards! That‚Äôll get em
"All you complain about the screen, WRs are good enough to make that play. Also don't want to risk a TO"
I really hope we start running it up the middle more in the second half. They seem to be on top of the outside runs so far
Anyone know if Avery is getting any burn yet? Special teams maybe?
Yeah that would be exciting if they are playing golf
Holding?
That Buffalo punt was so bad lmao
here ya go gio lemme help you with that 1st
Vince just HIT joe lol
Is it still halftime ??
Has williamson played played at all?
Close to a block there
"One thing about PI. It‚Äôs weird to see, often, when a player doesn‚Äôt get called but only blocks with one arm. How the hell do you land? Just on your face?"
Go forward
Where is everyone demanding we run to the middle?
Derek Watt sighting
The outside runs are horrible
That was a sick throw by Tua
Omg Berry got dem hairy legs
"woulda been cool to have an eight yard gain on either of the first two downs, huh lol"
Special teams has been great so far
Conner has been bad but the O-line has sucked in run blocking also the last 3 weeks. Only road grater we have is Dotson.
"As stupid as these slinky apple ads are, still better than ""what's a computer?"""
It‚Äôs brilliant being undefeated but with the way we call offense I can‚Äôt see us going all the way unfortunately.. Randy really is below average. Good teams will figure us out.
Ow
that punt just bought Danny Smith 5 more years of job security didn't it
"I just wanna trust me, I wanna see MacFarland as much as anyone, or at least snell, but AM is out with an illness for this game as a last minute scratch."
d doing it on third downs
Nahhhhhh
This kinda play should be a catch imo but the way the rules are it will prolly not be
I think that‚Äôs incomplete
Not fully in control of the FB and i didn't see an angle showing he got that second foot in for sure. I think this stands
"Feet were in, but I'd like to see another replay where we can see if he controls the ball through the completion of the play"
No inconclusive evidence
"50/50 with time of full possession, subjective but idk if enough to overturn. That‚Äôs how most these calls go."
"Ball is moving too much, gotta stay incomplete I'd think"
"If overturned, it will be the Bengals first third down conversion of the game."
I don‚Äôt think he maintained possession of it
I think he got both feet in but the ball was jiggling around.
"His knee looked broken, looked so weird."
But did he have control? Honest question because at this point I have no idea what a catch is and what isn‚Äôt.
What happened
Looked like a Bungle punched McCloud in the face when he was on the ground.
Theyre gonna bitch about refs after the game
Again with the outside runs
Forward progress
Anyone counting the number of drops today??
Yo that ball came out like a rocket wtf
My boy Clay
Why doesn‚Äôt this team throw down the field more?
This game has had some weird play-calling. Like so many sweeps lol.
New set of downs and a new opportunity to try and establish the run baby!
Ok I think they have an eye on Claypool.  Just run Conner.
Good shit CC
Keep passing
Claypool lookin' slick with that snag.
Why is the running game not working?
So this Claypool guy is a pretty ok dude.
That was a pretty pass.
EBRON
Not Ebron!
Ebron is a beast man
Can our receivers catch the god damn ball please ffs
Wow.
Ebronatron
Does Claypool remind anyone else of Santanio Holmes
Ebron back in. All good
Ben usually drills that throw
I think Ebron landing on the defender helped him not possibly get injured... ankle might have came down sketchy if he didn't bounce on top of him.  Just the wind knocked out
We need to chew clock.
3rd and 2 is our diciest situation how do we not have a solid play for these situations?
"Come on, Ben, no more overthrows"
That throw LOL
I love backyard ben
Has the camera work been absolute crap this game or am I just getting old and need a bigger tv? (Not mutually exclusive)
That was going to juju all the way
FIRST DOWN JUJU!
CONNOR BACK FROM THR DEAS
Connor with room finally
JC haters in shambles
My butthole itches
There‚Äôs the Run.
Hells yes
yooooooo
Mapletron (:
i love u chase
Holy moly whatta throw
üçÅ
"Oof, knew I should have started Ben instead of Russ."
I'm still clenching my asscheeks so hard I'll shit diamonds laters.
oh boy are they gonna do that again lol
There‚Äôs zero pressure on Ben.
I‚Äôll take any positive play no matter how small
Gotta turn around on that shit.
Eh kind of a weak PI call
What a pitiful DPI üòÇ
Take Ben out pleaseeeee
"Yep, that's dpi"
Jaden use having a game.
Should be another PI
Our offensive line has been amazing in pass blocking today. It's strange that we haven't been able to run.
Lol they should‚Äôve declined it. Ben bout to pick this up
LETS GO OFFENSE
Good coverage are smoking something that was just overthrown
Atta boy betry
Yikes Bince!
Classic Berry punt.
Vince Williams is a man.
Alright I take what I said about Berry back
Vinny is good for one of those a game. Absolute menace.
I like all the targets to Claypool even though a lot of them haven‚Äôt connected. It will pay off later in the season. Claypool is weapon.
Defense is on one today. I fucking love it
The defense is just beating down on them. Beautiful
This D is swarming!
Cam Sutton boi
Ben looking like a Jojo character in that graphic
tf is yelling lol
One of these times
What's Ben talking about?
When is juju‚Äôs contract up? I‚Äôd hate to see him go
Gotttaaaaaa have thattttt
That says all I need to know about the run game.  It‚Äôs reached an Arians level bad I thought wasn‚Äôt possible again.
Great punt!
Safety please...
Berry!!!!
Bro berry drives me nuts lol
Coulda been down at the 1 if he let it roll a bit more wtf TJ wants a safety
Push em back!!!
Blitz time
"I know we‚Äôve been struggling with the run game, but it‚Äôs 3rd and 1 and you‚Äôre up by 3 scores."
[deleted]
Good stop Bud! Block the damn punt
"A.J. Green 4 targets 0 catches.  Must really be thinking, why do I want to stay here."
"For the ninth time, Mrs. Bueller."
I was really feeling a hold in the endzone for a safety there... but I guess i'll accept a punt
There's Bud!
3rd down defense has been phenomenal today
Good read Bud
3 and out! 3 and out!
ROBBED
LETS FO OFFENSE
Giving them a redo huh refs
Can we take Ben out now so he doesn't get hurt?
I fucking love Ray Ray
Ray ray is that dude
Ray Ray has gotten so close to housing one of these bitches
I can't put into words how much I love this team üíõüñ§üíõüñ§
Amazing patience! I so badly want him to take it to the house!
"Ray Ray ""All Pro"" McCloud"
Fuck thought ray ray had it all the way
LETS GO OFFENSE
That vision/timing. McCloud is here to stay!!
Ok boys time to take Ben out we won.
Ben wants to give Washington his TD to complete the infinity gauntlet.
THERE IS ALWAYS A FREE DEFENDER UNBLOCKED EVERY RUN PLAY. SHEESH
JUJU WONDERFUL EFFORT
44 is a poor blocker
"I‚Äôll never understand why teams choose to punt in situations like that. Sure you‚Äôre backed into your own end zone, but kicking the ball away takes you out of the territory where even a miracle can save you. And a loss is still a loss whether it‚Äôs by 3 scores or 4."
I am prepared to miss Juju and Bud like a mf after we deliver them their rings
What's the finger sniff thing juju keeps doing?
Mason getting ready?
"I take a shot very td, and 2 rolling rocks per quarter. Pls... my liver"
"I hate to say it, but I don‚Äôt think Derek watt is on this team next year. I can‚Äôt remember one play that he‚Äôs made. Maybe he‚Äôs just been hurt"
Okay can we bench Ben now? Games over
Ok..now I feel like I can relax..kinda
End around lol
Hey. Sfinchter. Outside. Runs. Are. Not. Working.
M A P L E T R O N
CHA$E MONEY TD NO 2
Maple!!!
"Did DJ get hurt again? Dude was a vacuum first half, but not a single catch in the second"
Too easy!
Maybe now Colin Cowherd won't have an excuse about us not blowing out a team this year.
Bengals just running down the clock.
Highsmith played pretty well in that series
BUD!!!!
LETS GO DEFENSE
"Caught sleeping, twice."
ROBO!
Someone got turned around so hard it was actually pretty funny.
Number 9 in shambles
So what game do we break the sack record in this year?
Commentator cursed him into getting a sack
Bend dont break Defense
Gonna go watch the rocket launch. More interesting than this beat down. GG gentlemen.
Quick shout out to the astronauts.
Oh god. Mason lmao
9-0 baby you love to see it
Is it too late to trade for a RB?
[deleted]
My balls smell
We need to bench Conner. Dude kills momentum anytime he runs the ball
Burrows a stud
I‚Äôm so sick of James Conner
Have we played a good team yet this year?
PUT IN DUCK
Time to find out which offensive player is going to be scapegoat to blame instead of Ben today!
Sorry if I missed it din Ben totally miss a wide open reciver by throwing it out of bounds at our first drive.
Did we plan on using jaylen samuels at all this year
This play-calling is pure fucking GARBAGE. I am so sick of seeing this crap every week.
"Marcus Allen: he's not good, folks."
"Too much wind. Old QB can‚Äôt throw, especially the deep ball. Got it."
"This offense only works with 5 receivers or 4 receivers and 1 TE (00/01). 

Not a winning formula long term."
We‚Äôre dominating the game statistically but struggling. Not surprised this is what happens when you don‚Äôt assert yourselves lmao
We have the worst schematics in football.
No late hit call on Ben??
"Hey what do you know, we abandon our shit running game and good things happen. We need a new back. Great throw Ben"
"I swear to christ, this team can't score a touchdown on second and goal? Ever? Why do we always have to wait for third and goal to score touchdowns? How can an 8-0 team be leading by only double digits in the first half? Has any team that's won the super bowl ever not been up by triple digits at all times for the entirety of a season? James Conner needs to stop doing ballet in the backfield and learn an honest trade like plumbing. Why hasn't he signed up for a technical course at itt tech? What kind of a world are even living in? Can we please just crucify Randy Fichtner on a cross of burning i beams like a normal nfl team, even if jet fuel won't melt steel? Why hasn't he been strangled with Butler's entrails yet? My pappy's steelers never would have put up with this namby pamby murmble splurtz hlarble sorry had a stroke. Fahr Tomlin."
I love Connor but he's been bad today
Conner stinks wow
This defense has given up 40 yards to Burrow in 45 seconds.
Alright boys we just need to keep it up through the second half and we‚Äôre 9-0
Does the fact we‚Äôre only up 15 and Cincy has the ball scare anyone ? We‚Äôre out playing them (minus our offense being inconsistent) and we‚Äôre only up 15...
[deleted]
Ben looks way off
Bens deep ball is fucking gone
Ben missing wide open receivers on deep routes is bad
Let's go! Berry's deep ball is better than ben's!
Conner needs to stop trying to be cute
"Once again, horrible deep ball on 3rd down"
[deleted]
For a second I thought she said Big Ben was putting his arm in a sling and I wanted to vomit.
"Burrow had all day to throw there, but at least the coverage was good"
Damn DJ just go upfield
Calling an ass game on offense. When will it change?
Why do AFCN games always have such sloppy weather
DJ trying to cost us the game here
Also did not expect this much Brooks exposure. I like it
You guys should have seen the UFOs flying around my neighborhood.  Turns out it was just airborne trash cans with this nutty wind.
Anyone in pittsburgh getting the game??? It‚Äôs not on Fox 53
Of course a field goal
Field goal after field goal after field goal doesn‚Äôt win Super Bowls
Ben has to learn to get the first down and yards instead of going for the home run play on 3rd down¬†
"Why did we get dobbs if we aren‚Äôt going to use him, he‚Äôs 30x better than rudolf"
that little shove out of bounds was a penalty vs the ratbirds.
Jesus take the damn point
"Steve Nelson, second greatest free agent in Steelers history (behind James Farrior)"
well that's fucking inexcusable
"Nice, Watt in coverage"
This is going to be like that KC playoff game in 2016 isn‚Äôt it?
This game is being streamed on NFL.com
So when will the offense ever become consistent? It‚Äôs just hard to watch and they make the same mistakes every game it seems. Almost feels like the good record is covering some bad offense.
Ooof.  Our playcalling.  I just don't know...
Cam Sutton is crazy underrated
Why does it seem like James Connor runs backwards everytime he gets the ball
"I love Conner, but he needs to know that speed isn‚Äôt his game. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the scheme or if it‚Äôs Conner deciding to bounce it out, but something about that needs to change"
Off topic but does anyone have a ps5 digital edition just laying around that they‚Äôd like to sell?
"C'mon - let's get _another_ 3.

<sigh>"
Yea let‚Äôs just give them the underneath and let them keep driving lmao
Our offense fucking stinks and is inconsistent
Berry can boom it. No consistency though.
"Imagine almost losing to the Cowboys because we were looking ahead to THIS game, then still not having a game plan."
This one is interesting. I'd say catch
I am getting that Steeler late game anxiety again...
How about running it up the gut with Connor?
We really needed that bye
Don‚Äôt run the ball ever again.  Ever.
Man we keeping getting these plays where the is almost an absolute sick catch
They donated a touchdown to the Make Claypool Seem Useless With Running Plays Fund
"So, when do we get away from Connor?  He has no explosion, when he goes laterally, you just know he's going down behind the line, he has no juke... he's killing us a bit on the ground, right?"
Please take Ben out.
If they score another TD put Dobbs in lol
"looked like claypool stopped running, gotta run those out"
Calling a safety here.
Lets get a safety here fellas
"Switzer would have housed that 

/s"
"Run, run.....anyone wanna help me out with the next play?"
Let‚Äôs see what Dobbs can do!
"Rudolph is one, this going to get close"
Why does Ben love dionte so much. He is so targeted all the time. He ain‚Äôt Antonio brown.
Ben sucks asshole right now
Conner is sooooo bad lmao
No disrespect at all but... Is it just me or does Juju look like a rag doll every time he gets hit?
We aren‚Äôt a very good 8-0 team lol
"That's well deserved. Without those bad turnovers, Bengals would be up already. No surprise none of the elite teams are really afraid of the Steelers."
"And this sub already on the Randy hate. Playcalling was fine, execution wasn't good."
Just a wild Idea but Moss from bills would be a nice fit for steelers.
Is that Ryan Shazier talking to Ben?
Picking us apart.
Let‚Äôs see how fast rudolf and throw the game
Ahh yes the throw it deep on third and manageable. That works all the time /s
[deleted]
Well this is where our defense gives up a field goal or TD isnt it
Wish we could have a slightly better offense.
damn claypool drops a lot of passes
Who‚Äôs fucking idea was it to throw short on a 3rd and really long?
Villanueva is ass idc what stats you throw at me
"He didn't put his arms around Ben until AFTER he threw it, how is that not roughing the passer?!"
"AJ Green is one of the most injury prone players that I've ever seen. I have to give him credit, he's made way more money sitting on his couch than even the laziest of trust fund babies."
Conner is not starting RB material. Ben is having another dud. Game should be over already
we won‚Äòt sniff a SB with this run game sadly
Put Dobbs in. Not Rudolph
"Man, our offense SUCKS"
People really think I literally mean we‚Äôre not an 8-0 team... we barely beat the Cowboys and are struggling with the Bungles
#Sit Ben
Tomlin can‚Äôt be that good of a coach if he keeps running it like this
"I have a bad feeling boys

Guys please don‚Äôt be mean to me or I‚Äôll kill my self"
The fuck?? Why a deep shot. Dipshit OC
Atta Boyd.
Our offense is so fucking ass
[deleted]
Rudolph> ben
5 yards on a first down run? Let‚Äôs throw it twice and punt
Can we get rid of the play by play here?  It‚Äôs like 5 plays behind.
"How was that not a safety when the Bengals player touched the ball before it went into the endzone and then never fully recovered possession to properly down it before getting tackled in the endzone? By rule, isn‚Äôt that technically a fumble into the endzone recovered by the Bengals?"
Run the damn ball please
Can we get a first down please
Have we been able to run the ball at any point this season?
Aiden Tate is a big receiver
"I hope I‚Äôm wrong. But I have a feeling Burrow is about to unleash and start throwing bombs, Offense needs to capitalize on all these given opportunities. Rotate these damn Running backs!"
Just kick the field goal now lmao
We should start Rudolph until half then Ben comes on the second half after learning the ways of the defense and wreck them
Jesus christ that was abysmal
Throwing behind the line of scrimmage üòçüòç
Ah shit. That was targeted
Anyone know where you can watch this online?
Need stickum for the bottom of Conors shoes
This playcalling makes me want to turn the game off sometimes
"I watch a lot of other games, we might be the worst running team in the league."
Hold up we passed on 1st and we moved forward?!?! Wooooooow Randy!!
That was complete
Is it just me or are the Bengals defense all trying to go low and hit knees?
Should we just put in rudolph or dobbs now?
"Well, guess that‚Äôs what we get for being asscheeks at running the ball."
"Hey... Randy... that play you just called.  3 yards on first down as a rush is not a bad thing.  Now, if you get another 3 on a rush or a short throw, you aren't having a 3rd and 9+ like you do half the time with your outside zone run shit"
TAKE EM DOWN AGAIN BOYS
Is this the worst 8-0 team ever? They're not convincing at all. I'm sorry but one blowout isn't enough to convince me when you can't break away. I realize the Bengals are better than their record but what the hell was that egg that the defense just laid?
stupid 2 point conversion and now a stupid fucking injury what the fuck
"And here comes another field goal.

Fuck this."
"7 minutes left, the way this game has been going it might be enough time for the Bengals to claw their way back in."
What should I play today? My series x or my ps5?
GIO!
Wait till we face a good defense lmao we‚Äôre gonna have to win like 9-6 or something cause we ain‚Äôt winning no shoot out
Is there a worse running back than Conner?
"I have this creeping suspicion that Diontae is Limas Sweed 2.0. Slightly improved, but still very mediocre hands"
Ben having 0 mobility. Not having the long ball anymore is fucking hurting us really.
My butthole itches
"okay, this is where they start driving down the field on us really easily. its hard to watch but we just gotta hang on"
I love McCloud but he really should do some speed training this offseason
Offensive line is the worst in the league. The Steelers aren‚Äôt winning the Super Bowl because of it. They are getting blown off the ball.
"Bud and TJ are being so unproductive out here. 

Is a little pass rush too much to ask from ‚Äúthe best duo in the league‚Äù

Edit: nice"
can we please get rid of Randy and just let Ben call his own plays
Why does everyone hate Vilma? I perfer this over Romo being a prick

JuJu drops a lot of balls for being a WR1

i thought this said screaming and that you were screaming at the state of Wisconsin for not broadcasting the game
"Watching the TV media, why does no one discuss the Steelers being the only undefeated team? Instead the are talking about rookie QBs that have only won 2 games, or Tom Brady and Antonio Brown living together.
I guess it is true - ""they hate us cuz they ain't us"".

*EDIT* OK, I must be watching the wrong shows because it seems like I am the only one not seeing any discussion on them."
"Selective hearing.  In the two pregame shows I listened to this morning, the Steelers were easily the single most discussed team."
"I'm fine without the Media distractions

When the media pays attention to us,, Its like a cancer in the locker room."
"They are talking.

But

They would love to do nothing but talk about Mahomes or Jackson."
"8-0 is like the only thing to talk about, they aren't particularly exciting or interesting"
"Most times they talk shit about us, the media doesnt like Pittsburgh."
I feel like we are the only team that is talked about in every pregame show...
"I live in Australia and I have heard three Australian stations talk about this week‚Äôs game. 

They don‚Äôt even call it football, but, I have seen three Australian sports announcers struggle with pronouncing Roethlisberger."

Side note, why do you even care? The attention is completely unnecessary."

He never brought the ball out. Ball has to come out then go back for a safety
Damn you beat me to it lol. I have no clue
Why didn‚Äôt we get a safety? The ball hit the return man in play and then went backwards into the end zone and got tackled
"When the ball touched him it was live, but he didn‚Äôt have possession. If he would‚Äôve ran back into the end zone from the field of play it would‚Äôve been a safety."
Same
I thought the same thing.
He gave himself up. When you do that the refs can call it.
No possession so no safety

I predict Ben won't get sacked much today.  The defensive backs will rather defend their immune systems than chance getting close to Ben and get Covid.
When he fell on his elbow just now I felt my blood pressure skyrocket
Good prediction
That was a dumb decision to go for it. Just take the fucking field goal coach. Claypool better be okay
"I understand you‚Äôre upset that Claypool got injured on the play, but how was it a dumb decision lol"
No it wasn't. Would have put them up by 2 TDs
"would put us up by 2TD, but if we dont convert its still 2 scores worth"
"Lol at take a field goal. It's an extra point, noob."
"Grand scheme of things, a 12 point lead and a 13 point lead are similar enough to call that a wash. The important number is 14 to get two full touchdowns ahead. Going for it in that situation is probably a good call, however the okay called to go for it was bad. Never throw a fade when you only have one down."
Not a dumb decision at all.

Connor isn't the issue
"Offensive Line isn't creating any holes, which makes it difficult for a running back like Conor to get going."
Offensive line can't seem to run block this season. We rely too much on outside runs (which Conner is never suited for) because of it. Gotta learn to run up the gut
We can‚Äòt run against one of the worst rush defenses yikes
"If we could block the rush, maybe"
"The line and play calling are the problems.  O-line aren't creating any holes and Fichtner is calling way too many run plays to the outside for negative yardage.  Bringing in Snell, you run the risk of a fumble."
"The rest of our backs are really ...meh.

They've been trying to sweep Claypool, and even he gets stuffed almost immediately. The backs aren't the problem, lack of standout talent aside."
Snell seems more explosive to me

Did you realize that we are leading with 22 points?
Stop bitching around
"The score is 29-7, the team is 8-0 and averaging over 25 pts a game......come on...."
What an exaggeration.
"Granted Conner is a solid running back, but we need another guy in the backfield it‚Äôs like watching the tin man run the ballüòê"
It‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt calling runs that let him get downhill or they just aren‚Äôt getting the push. We‚Äôve seen what he does when they get push and he isn‚Äôt required to dance around
Need a new ~~rb~~ line
Conner is good when he can run downhill.  He hasn't had that chance this game.
"Also mcfarland is out with illness.
Mostly just don't think it's in the game plan right now. And why should it be?"
We have solid RBs. Snell and samuels should be given a chance at least.

Tomlin is giving you a week off because Steelers at Jags is going to kill at least 15% of the fanbase
We're just using one of the two annual easy games we're allowed today.
This score is...boring lol
That's what happens when you play the Bungles. No worries.
somethings_wrong_i_can_feel_it.jpg
Something wrong...I hold my head
It‚Äôs probably because you haven‚Äôt been able to post a ‚Äúfire Tomlin‚Äù post this season...
We get 3 or 4 easy games a year (browns and bengals)
Why is it always Ohio teams that give us an easy game?
"We had the 31st easiest schedule in the league before the year. I think honestly it got easier.

But hey, we here doing it baby."

It both looks like and is not unexpected that the Bengals have negative seven points.
When your opponent has a physical disability preventing them from converting on third down:
"Honestly I love what I‚Äôm seeing but the run game concerns me. I was not a huge fan when they were up big in this game and still did empty packages instead of practicing their run plays. If we want to go deep, then the backfield needs to be a bigger factor then it currently is. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll figure it out, but I want to see it happen."

I hate the fact that the color commentator actively cheers during the game with his mic on.  I don't blame him for cheering on his team but at times I have trouble hearing play by play due to him.
They also ended the game saying that they knew Ben would come into the week like John Wayne the drama queen complaining about his knees and throw 400/4TDs. And they were right about his 4 touchdowns. Like what??

Hot seat????????????????????????????"
Expect PETA to raise a stink after 53 men from Pittsburgh just skinned cats on national television.
"Our first relaxing game since Cleveland. How sweet it is. Let‚Äôs talk it out: 

Good: 

- Boswell- alls well that ends well, Chris Boswell. Absolute money. 

- Edmunds- I know you guys don‚Äôt wanna hear it (again) but he balled out, was all over the field and did a hell of a job tackling the catch and being around the ball. 

- Diontae- the young goat shows up man. This dude is pure electricity and you can see why. Drops are an issue but whew he is dynamic. 

- Berry- looks like all it took was his ass getting cut but he is BACK lmao. Great punts, flipping the field position. Exactly what we‚Äôve needed. 

- Juju- physical. This dude is just physical and will fight you for yards. Not even that but talk about a great teammate, you talk about juju. 

- Chase claypool. Let‚Äôs just throw all receivers on this list because we spread the ball and spread the love. Unreal how much of an impact he has had his rookie year, I never would have believed it. 

- TJ. Again it‚Äôs cheating having him on this list. But fuck you Myles Garrett, this man is DPOY and you can see why. Clean stunts, constant pressure. I look forward to the day we give him a blank check. 

- Uncle Joey. Goddamn talk about pass breakups! What a game from the seasoned vet man. Not getting anywhere on him and truly had his own island. 

- 01 offense. (4 WR, 1 TE) This is our passing package where Ben calls the digs aka our most successful package. Truly cannot he stopped. Of course there‚Äôs a downside but does it have long term success? I do not know. I‚Äôm not one to cry about balance, but any semblance of a run game would be appreciated. Regardless, Ben is fhat dude. 

- Ben. Hey speak of the devil. Give my man CPOY, AFC POW, and MVP while you‚Äôre at it. Nuff said. Put some respect on 7‚Äôs name. 

- Sutton- this man is playing his way to a PAY DAY and we can see why. What a stud. 

Bad:

- Third down O. Gotta be better. Conversions need to hit. No way around it. Crucial to keep these drives going and defense getting some rest. We‚Äôve been decent this year but fell short, needed to be better today. 

- Run game/OL. Fuck. I need another watch but what‚Äôs the answer? Where‚Äôs the shortcomings? We cannot run against DAL and CIN? that is VERT concerning and should not be the case. Gotta figure this out. Spoiler: it‚Äôs not JC that‚Äôs the problem. 

For all the lurking bungle fans....We dey 

Ben is your daddy

We‚Äôre 9-0

Steeler running game has been lacking recently after seeming strong early.

That game felt so relaxing and was much needed for me and my health after the last 2 weeks being nail biters - onto Jacksonville it is!!!
"Wasn't pretty early on, but the defense & pass game was just as dominant. Glad Ben looked great after getting hurt last week & not practicing. 9-0 baby!"
WHO DEY THINK GONE BEAT DEM BENGALS???
We needed a nice blowout like this. MY heart just can't take anymore close ones boys.
I think the bengals twitter acc is scared to tweet out the final score lol
The Bengals had 16 first downs. None of those came from third down.

- Berry had an AWESOME game. I didn't understand why we cut Colquitt at first but I'm so down with the love. 
- SPECIAL TEAMS MVP: Jordan Berry

*OFFENSE*

- Ben Ben Ben. What an absolute gunslinger. Missed a week of practice, came off two injured knees, suffered an elbow injury in game and still threw 300+ yards and 4 TDs two weeks straight. It's crazy that PFF thinks he's holding us back. Obviously deep ball accuracy has to improve but it's gotten better. 
- Wide receivers were fucking awesome today. Everyone got into the action. Diontae finally had a breakout game, and Claypool and Juju were money. These guys are a Top 5 group in the league and you can't change my mind.
- Ebron hasn't been eye popping but man is he reliable, and that one handed catch was a beauty. He's an absolute great locker  presence as well and I'm so glad we signed up. 
- Offensive line was pretty good in pass blocking. Bengals had some pressure but Ben was kept clean most of the game. Run blocking was absolutey horrendous. Every play it felt like the Bengals were already in the backfield when Conner got the ball.
- Run game has sucked. Part of it is run blocking, part of it that Conner doesn't have great vision. It needs to improve. 
- Fichtner is not the issue in this offense. He made some good calls today, but execution was our biggest problem in the first half. 
- OFFENSIVE MVP: Big Ben

*DEFENSE*

- 0-13 on third down. WOW. We need to stay consistent with this.
- Pass defense was mostly great. Haden had a GREAT game. Sutton blew a few coverages but had that absolute money FF. Nelson was pretty good too, and Edmunds and Minkah have quietly been a great safety duo. 
- TJ WATT. He's my DPOY and nothing will change my mind.
- Run defense was a bit better today, it seems like a lot of the run yards came in garbage time, but not having Bush has hurt us quite a bit. Once Alualu starts getting more snaps again it'll hopefully get better.
- Henry Mondeaux. Can we give this man some kudos? He's slowly improved every game and he had a great play where TJ could get the sack. 
- DEFENSIVE MVP: TJ Watt

*Coaching*

- Overall much better this week. Tomlin is COTY this year and nothing will change my mind. 

On to the Jags next week. This game screams trap game, but this year has proven that we don't care about those anymore. LET'S RIDE"
Urinating tree: THE STILLERS ARE GOIN TO THE SUPER BOWWWLLL
more wins like this please. its nice to have a relaxing sunday lol
"Welcome all, to the Big Ben Revenge Tour"
That win was COZY
LETS GO PATS!!!
I like it
Know how there are always post game interviews? Where does one watch those?
Good ass whooping boys. Feels good to stay undefeated another week. But I think it‚Äôs time they figured out we are a ‚Äúpass first to open up the run‚Äù type of team. For the second straight week rushing performance was pretty pathetic.
Next week we play for the Kordell photoshop.
seems ben should not practice more often lol
"I was just reading this crazy article and it says 

^^Tomlin ^^has ^^never ^^had ^^a ^^losing ^^season"
It must really suck to be a Bengals fan.
"I don't think I've ever rooted for the Patriots but to go along the meme of what is 2020, LETS GO PATS!!!"
So... SNF... do we... do we root for the Patriots? That can‚Äôt be right.
"My biggest concern is the number of Ben‚Äôs passes that are being tipped at the line. I can‚Äôt recall a season when he has had this many tipped passes. Sure, some of those are because of the short passes/extended runs, but that is something the OL can work on."
"Breaking: Steelers need 3 more Electoral Votes to secure the division.  7 more to get a 1 seed.

Lets be honest, Kansas City is finishing 15-1."
"Can anyone explain to me how the Bengals touched the ball at the two, have it bounce into the end zone and they fuck around with it and it‚Äôs not a safety? 

I miss Romo. 

Vilma sucks."
Easy Dub
Just a curious question: why do the players wear masks on the sidelines? Aren‚Äôt they all tested consistently?
"Guys. That was a pretty complete game. I know we gave up some passes but they played it safe and got stops when they needed to.

Offense, Defense, ST all clicked well. And boys, we settled for 3 FGs, punted on a 4th and short in Bengals territory, and still haven‚Äôt gotten our run game down. And we still hung 36 and won by 26. I think we have a squad."
"The Steelers kicked ass. 

And things of that nature"
"I know the whole ‚ÄúSteelers haven‚Äôt played anyone‚Äù bit is an old joke now but that being said, it‚Äôs good to decisively beat teams we should beat. Pretty much the whole team was clicking and if we are gonna claim to be legit super bowl contenders it‚Äôs good to demolish teams that we are much better than. Good teams do that. Let‚Äôs do the same with the jags"
"Idk if anyone remembers or cares, bit I got mod control of r/kneedeep. Dedicating it to Boswell and shit posting in general"
"Just here to chuckle about Lamar throwing a pick at the end of the half to take a FG op away from Tucker, and go into the locker room down a FG to a woeful Pats team."
Fuck every bird team (sorry Atlanta).
9 and 0!
Even mother nature hates the rat birds
Who dey??
We need a run game going forward.
LET'S FUCKING GOOO!!! WE IN ALL THEIR HEADS!!! WITNESS THE GREATNESS!!!
"Nice to not have a heart attack game. Running game wasn‚Äôt the best, but our passing was amazing. And that McLeod dude is a god."
What a great game!
We dey!
9-0 and my ps5 came today what a goooood day can‚Äôt wait for my kid to go to bed so I can game all night
"Lets fucking gooooo. Left some points on the table this game but in all, it‚Äôs hard to complain. Pretty nervous about next week. But hopefully we can keep this going"
Great game‚ÄºÔ∏è
"I wore my brand new salute-to-service Polamalu jersey today.  Not saying I deserve all the credit for today‚Äôs win, but..."
Pretty sure the last time I wanted the Patriots to win a game was their first Super Bowl against the Rams. This feels weird.
As expected.
"Zac Taylor is probably my favorite incompetent coach in the NFL at the moment. Going against him feels as close to a sure thing win as there is. He kicks field goals while down a million, has weird random play calls at inopportune times, and even looks the part of completely lost and in over his head. He‚Äôs accomplished absolutely nothing as a NFL coach. And I think the Bengals should sign him to an extension."
This is what happens when you disrespect the Towel Chuck Noll's blood and semen are blessed with each one you will be cursed and you have been warned many times
GET IN HERE 9-0 BABY
9-0. That is all
9-0 feels good
"**NINE**

**AND**

***Z E R O***"
9-0. This is the first game I watched completely this season. I've been avoiding watching because we've been winning and I am superstitious as fuck when it comes to the Steelers. This was an awesome win and a great game to watch.
"9-0 BABY YOU LOVE TO SEE IT

I'D SAY GG BUT FUCK THE BENGALS"
9-0. That‚Äôs all I have to say.
Gg guys!
Who dey?!??!!!
We‚Äôre 9-0!!!!! Damn it feels good to say that!
I love you all. 9-0. we dey. suck it bengals.
has anyone else noticed the amount of former steelers that are giving praises to this team?
"The purple pigeons lost to New Englands B team!! 

3 games up in division now. Please keep the fire lit! The  Jags and every game after are ‚Äúthe trap game‚Äù  

Steelers will need a running game . I‚Äôm not sure if Connor or someone is tipping the play or if its just poor execution. -because the other team D is beating him to the line of scrimmage virtually every time."
"9-0 Steelers on the road against a two win Jags team that is coming off a hard fought close loss against a first place team. The Ravens loom the next Thursday.

The question isn‚Äôt IF the Jags will win, but by how much."

Colin Cowherd said earlier this year that Roethlisberger was the worst QB in the division...
Baptism complete
Worst QB in the AFC North and it‚Äôs not even close /s
Where can I find a version of this for an iPhone wallpaper
KING IN THE NORTH!
"How can we be 9-0?

We haven't played anybody yet!"
We eat heisman trophies for breakfast

I wonder if we‚Äôll go undefeated and win the SB without ever facing a good team.

Kings of the North!
